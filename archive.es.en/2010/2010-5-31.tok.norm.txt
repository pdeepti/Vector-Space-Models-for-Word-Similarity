its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '
freudenheim told deutsche welle .
" it 's a great , memorable novel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the novel has been a success in both the uk and the us in a recent segment dedicated to the novel on the american tv talk show " charlie rose , " new york times book reviewer liesl schillinger pointed out that while much has been written about world war ii , the fate of ordinary german citizens during that time remains largely unaddressed . " what other novels about ordinary germans in wartime do we know ? " asked schillinger rhetorically . in her review , schillinger writes that to read the novel is " to be accompanied by a wise , somber ghost who grips your shoulder and whispers into your ear : ' this is how it was .
this is what happened . " ' intense texts from a troubled mind hans fallada was born as rudolf ditzen in the german city of greifswald in 1893 .
his pseudonym derives from a combination of characters found in grimm 's fairy tales .
from adolescence onwards , his life was marked by accidents , illness , drug addiction and mental instability , leading to several stints in insane asylums .
he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .
today , the novel is considered to be a modern classic , due to its intense descriptions of the last days of the weimer republic . great for some , ' bourgeois ' for others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " little man , what now ?

" this could be seen as bourgeois , but , as always , it 's a matter of perception , " added doberenz . nevertheless , doberenz emphasizes that fallada 's work has already been well received in germany since the 1970 's , but for this same reason it does not have the " boom potential " on home soil that it is now having abroad . however , a different kind of fallada renaissance is currently taking place in germany - in the form of stage adaptations of his works , most notably the play " little man , what now ?

its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '
freudenheim told deutsche welle .
" it 's a great , memorable novel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the novel has been a success in both the uk and the us in a recent segment dedicated to the novel on the american tv talk show " charlie rose , " new york times book reviewer liesl schillinger pointed out that while much has been written about world war ii , the fate of ordinary german citizens during that time remains largely unaddressed . " what other novels about ordinary germans in wartime do we know ? " asked schillinger rhetorically . in her review , schillinger writes that to read the novel is " to be accompanied by a wise , somber ghost who grips your shoulder and whispers into your ear : ' this is how it was .

his pseudonym derives from a combination of characters found in grimm 's fairy tales .

he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .
today , the novel is considered to be a modern classic , due to its intense descriptions of the last days of the weimer republic . great for some , ' bourgeois ' for others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " little man , what now ?

following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '
freudenheim told deutsche welle .
" it 's a great , memorable novel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the novel has been a success in both the uk and the us in a recent segment dedicated to the novel on the american tv talk show " charlie rose , " new york times book reviewer liesl schillinger pointed out that while much has been written about world war ii , the fate of ordinary german citizens during that time remains largely unaddressed . " what other novels about ordinary germans in wartime do we know ? " asked schillinger rhetorically . in her review , schillinger writes that to read the novel is " to be accompanied by a wise , somber ghost who grips your shoulder and whispers into your ear : ' this is how it was .

his pseudonym derives from a combination of characters found in grimm 's fairy tales .
from adolescence onwards , his life was marked by accidents , illness , drug addiction and mental instability , leading to several stints in insane asylums .
he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .
today , the novel is considered to be a modern classic , due to its intense descriptions of the last days of the weimer republic . great for some , ' bourgeois ' for others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " little man , what now ?

its new report entitled " women and health : today 's evidence , tomorrow 's agenda , " cites evidence that tobacco advertising increasingly targets girls .
thus for this year 's world no tobacco day , the health agency decided to highlight the tobacco industry 's tactics of associating tobacco use with beauty and freedom in its advertising .
one part of this year 's campaign was creating a series of hard-hitting posters that show attractive , but extremely ill , smokers , such as a model with mouth cancer or a tracheotomy tube .
" this campaign calls attention to the tobacco industry 's attempts to market its deadly products by associating tobacco use with beauty and liberation , " who assistant director-general for noncommunicable diseases and mental health , ala alwan , said .
cigarette marketing has become especially unscrupulous in parts of africa and asia , said adepju olukoya , who works on gender and health issues for who .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking women were often considered sophisticated " the industry has studied what makes women tick in both developed and developing countries .
in many developing countries especially , the young people want to be part of the global advance of fashion , in music , in being ' with it ' , " she told deutsche welle .
" so the tobacco industry uses this effectively by promoting sports events and concert events that draw young people - both male and female , " she added . sobering statistics challenging the millions of dollars spent on cigarette marketing wo n't be easy , but the who is trying .
even though it is unlikely that its posters will be seen by as many young women as see the cigarette advertisements , the organization hopes they will deter at least some women from lighting up .
" the world no tobacco day -lrb- poster -rrb- campaign seeks to turn the tables on the tobacco industry , showing tobacco use in its true light , " who 's bettcher said .
" no one should be fooled ...
tobacco is not stylish .
it is deadly and addictive . "
tobacco use kills more than five million people every year , about 1.5 million of whom are women , who says .
about half of long-term smokers die from tobacco related illness , the group says .
in general , statistics show women are more vulnerable to tobacco-related illnesses , according to germany 's federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- .
the group says second-hand smoke is a particular threat to women , especially pregnant women and their babies .
according to bzga , 26 percent of german women and 34 percent of german men are smokers .
long history of women and tobacco the who 's poster campaign is just the latest salvo in a long fight between health agencies and the tobacco industry over the targeting of women and girls .
in the 1920s , lucky strike cigarettes first linked smoking to weight control by urging women to " reach for a lucky instead of a sweet . "
in the 1960s , philip morris introduced virginia slims , the first cigarette brand created specifically for women and targeted to that consumer group .
and in the 1970s , tobacco companies targeted women with ads implying that " light " and " low tar " cigarettes were safer for consumption - despite knowing this was not the case , the us anti-smoking advocacy group tobacco free kids says .

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .
" at first glance it does not look like this basic rule was adhered to . "
germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle said he was " deeply concerned about the events last night in the waters off gaza ... these are disconcerting initial reports . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said " nothing can justify " the violence .
ambassadors from the 27 eu member nations were to hold an emergency meeting monday afternoon to discuss the incident .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt on monday said it was important to " quickly establish " what happened on the boats .
he said he had summoned the israeli ambassador to get more information .
he said that he had been in touch with ashton , and that the eu must give " a clear response during the day when we get a clearer picture of what has happened . "
authorities in spain and greece have also summoned the israeli ambassadors in their countries for information .
greek government officials announced that they would withdraw from planned joint military exercises with israel in protest .
turkish outrage turkey 's foreign ministry warned of " irreparable consequences " after the incident and announced at midday that they would be recalling their ambassador to israel .
some of the ships were sailing under turkish flags and media reports indicate that turkish nationals are among the dead .
" by targeting civilians , israel has once again shown its disregard for human life and peaceful initiatives .
we strongly condemn these inhumane practices of israel , " the turkish foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this deplorable incident , which took place in open sees and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law , may lead to irreparable consequences in our bilateral relations . "
bildunterschrift : many of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to israeli hospitals turkey has long been an important ally of israel , one of only a few in the muslim world .
but relations have declined since israel 's attack on gaza a year and a half ago , in which some 1,400 palestinians died and of which turkey was very critical .
on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .
in another demonstration , a crowd of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the residence of israeli ambassador gabby levy in ankara shouting " damn israel " and reciting prayers .
dozens of police were on duty in front of the building .
deadly clashes the six-boat flotilla was organized by several groups , including a turkish human rights organization , and was said to be carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid , as well as pro-palestinian activists .
the ships were in international waters 124 kilometers off the coast of israel when they were intercepted by the israeli navy and boarded by commandos .
demonstrators on the ships clashed with the soldiers .
the israeli army said the demonstrators were armed with knives and clubs and that commandos opened fire after one person on the boat grabbed a weapon from a commando .
the death toll from the incident is unclear , but the israeli military said more than ten activists had been killed and dozens of activists and soldiers were injured .
israeli trade minister binyamin ben-eliezer voiced " regret at all the fatalities , " but added that soldiers had been " set upon with batons and tools , " which forced them to defend themselves .
hamas , the islamist group which controls the gaza strip , issued a call for an " uprising " of muslims and arabs across the world .
israel has imposed a blockade on gaza since 2007 , hoping to prevent weapons and bombmaking supplies from getting into the hands of militants .
but opponents of the measure and some nongovernmental organizations say the blockade has also prevented needed medical supplies and food from getting to the area , a claim israel has denied. svs / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a national mission in recent years , german contestants have been no stranger to the bottom tier at europe 's top song competition .
german viewers were more inclined to poke fun at the event than tune in .
facing a downward spiral , the powers that be at public broadcaster ard - germany 's eurovision broadcaster - knew they had one big chance to turn things around .
in what seemed like a last-ditch effort , or an act of desperation , the station teamed up with private channel prosieben to put germany 's contestant for this year 's competition on air .
luck was on their side : popular german television personality stefan raab - who shares a well-documented love of music - took on the role as head judge in the preliminary talent search for 2010 . in another stroke of good fortune , raab proved to the competition at germany 's most popular casting show " dsds " that this kind of contest could be done - and done well - without humiliating the contestants along the way .
it 's the singer , not the song out of 4,500 aspiring competitors who applied to appear on the multi-part series " our star for oslo , " 10 made it through .
but it was clear from the very start that lena meyer-landrut had something that no other contestant had .
as stefan raab put it , " when she gets on stage , everything blossoms . "
technical perfection was n't what counted in the preliminary competition .
several of lena 's competitors were more polished singers , but lena 's charisma and contagious feel-good persona were one-of-a-kind .
her song for oslo , " satellite , " was a catchy but run-of-the mill piece of pop music .
it was the singer , not the song , that made the difference : lena 's performance got people to take a closer listen .
breaking the rules over the years , the eurovision song contest has created a parallel universe of kitsch and pomp .
the world 's biggest tv event , it features over-the-top performances , tacky costumes and songs that might be unbearable to anyone who lacks a secret fondness for bad music .
lena 's decision to opt out of the gaudy spectacle was a wise one - but it would only work for someone with her special charm .
where others relied on pyrotechnics and led outfits , lena took the stage as lena , pure and simple .
since february , she 's weathered the media circus , completed her school-leaving exams and recorded her first album , but lena still comes through as authentic - and anything but routine .
with a deliberate non-marketing strategy , she won over germany - and then the rest of europe .
a little lena in everyone little is known about lena 's personal life , and the singer is kept away from tabloid media - and that 's what makes her so relatable .
she 's confident , young , cheeky - a bit zany - but ambitious : who would n't want to be the very same way ?
we 've had enough of empty promises , media fabrications and artificial emotions .
let 's just enjoy the moment and be glad the lena phenomenon has bridged a generation gap , challenged the superstar top-model mold - and of course , that because of her , germany will have the honor of hosting next year 's eurovision song contest .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer is to stand down after the bonn talks poor countries set new demands developing countries , meanwhile , have raised new demands and pressed developed countries to take greater responsibility for climate change .
in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '
freudenheim told deutsche welle .
" it 's a great , memorable novel .

" the eu , which is russia ’ s biggest trade partner , appeared willing to make a deal before talks began in the southern city of rostov-on-don - but not without certain conditions .
brussels wants to see biometric passports for russian citizens and stronger security along russia ’ s southern borders before relaxing its visa requirements . the eu also announced before the summit that it is keen to contribute money to anti-corruption initiatives and judiciary reform in russia , although no figures were named . energy and economy energy will also dominate the agenda as talks get underway on tuesday .
the eu and russia currently support competing pipeline projects nabucco and south stream , both of which plan to begin pumping gas to europe . the summit , held twice a year , will be overshadowed by the current economic crisis that is gripping several eu member-nations and has not escaped russia ’ s attention . " the eu is living in a critical moment in its history , " russian deputy foreign minister alexander grushko told reporters on friday , adding , " we are closely watching how it strives to deal with the financial crisis . " new attitudes , new leadership while the current economic situation in europe is causing rifts between eu countries , tensions between the eu and russia are expected to be calmer than at previous summits , which have been marked by squabbles over human rights abuses in russia , gas deliveries and the 2008 war in georgia . this year expectations are high for productive talks at the summit , following medvedev ’ s statement in april that russia must show a " smiling " face to the world . the twenty-fifth eu-russia summit is the first to be held between russian president dmitry medvedev and eu president herman van rompuy whose position came into force last year under the lisbon treaty .

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beggars have been detained as the authorities try to " clean up " the city deplorable living and working conditions the authorities have also turned a blind eye to the working conditions for thousands of workers , many of whom do not even earn the minimum wage and are forced to work in an unsafe environment .
anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .
wherever they can not remove the slums , they will put up lovely bamboo screens so that tourists and sports people do not see the unseemly sight .
the work and living conditions are terrible .

a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .
high security during commonwealth games security for the games is another major concern .

the commonwealth games will take place from 3 to 14 october 2010 .

but the country 's constitution has clear guidelines on what happens next - and a power vacuum is not in sight . president horst koehler 's resignation is an unheard-of event in germany , but it will not result in a power vacuum .
according to the constitution , the head of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany 's federal states , takes over at this point .
every year , one of the 16 state premiers takes on the position of bundesrat president .
the present incumbent is jens boehrnsen , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- mayor of bremen .
boehrnsen will take over all of the federal president 's duties until an electoral college , the federal convention , elects a successor for koehler .
the federal convention must convene within 30 days - in this case , by june 30 . the federal convention is germany 's largest parliamentary body , and is solely responsible for the selection of the federal president .
all of the members of the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , are entitled to vote , as well as a corresponding number of representatives from the federal states .
the convention last met a year ago , in may 2009 , to re-elect koehler . then , it numbered 1,224 delegates .
germany could be in for a difficult vote the federal president is elected by secret ballot , without a prior debate , and requires an absolute majority .
should none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round , then the candidate who receives a simple majority in a third round of voting is considered elected as president .
germany 's head of state is not elected by the people .
as a rule , the political parties suggest candidates , not necessarily someone from within their ranks but a respected public figure capable of representing germany across party boundaries .
horst koehler , for instance , was supported by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the current ruling coalition in berlin .
this presidential election promises to be interesting because of the unclear situation in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which dispatches the greatest number of delegates to the federal convention .
the newly-elected parliament in duesseldorf does not have a governing majority yet , as coalition talks are still underway .
the result of these talks could have an effect on which way the nrw delegates votes . as a rule , federal convention delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice , but generally , they do adhere to their respective parties ' recommendations . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- db -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer is to stand down after the bonn talks poor countries set new demands developing countries , meanwhile , have raised new demands and pressed developed countries to take greater responsibility for climate change .
in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 31.05.2010 little-known german author lands posthumous bestseller abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fallada knew the realities of world war ii in germany from his own experience sixty-three years after his death , a new english translation of hans fallada 's novel about an anti-nazi resistance movement has found thousands of readers .
its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '
freudenheim told deutsche welle .
" it 's a great , memorable novel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the novel has been a success in both the uk and the us in a recent segment dedicated to the novel on the american tv talk show " charlie rose , " new york times book reviewer liesl schillinger pointed out that while much has been written about world war ii , the fate of ordinary german citizens during that time remains largely unaddressed . " what other novels about ordinary germans in wartime do we know ? " asked schillinger rhetorically . in her review , schillinger writes that to read the novel is " to be accompanied by a wise , somber ghost who grips your shoulder and whispers into your ear : ' this is how it was .
this is what happened . " ' intense texts from a troubled mind hans fallada was born as rudolf ditzen in the german city of greifswald in 1893 .
his pseudonym derives from a combination of characters found in grimm 's fairy tales .
from adolescence onwards , his life was marked by accidents , illness , drug addiction and mental instability , leading to several stints in insane asylums .
he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .
today , the novel is considered to be a modern classic , due to its intense descriptions of the last days of the weimer republic . great for some , ' bourgeois ' for others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " little man , what now ? " has been fallada 's best-known work till now despite his literary successes , fallada 's works have gone unheeded by german critics .
this " could be due to the fact that fallada is particularly good at describing everyday life and ordinary people , " andrea doberenz , a spokeswoman for fallada 's german publisher aufbau verlag , told deutsche welle . " this could be seen as bourgeois , but , as always , it 's a matter of perception , " added doberenz . nevertheless , doberenz emphasizes that fallada 's work has already been well received in germany since the 1970 's , but for this same reason it does not have the " boom potential " on home soil that it is now having abroad . however , a different kind of fallada renaissance is currently taking place in germany - in the form of stage adaptations of his works , most notably the play " little man , what now ?

its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest .

he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .

" all the hawkers have been removed .

a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .

the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 31.05.2010 opinion : the european external action service 's role in eu development policymaking requires safeguards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu aid service is to increase europe 's global role guest commentator mark furness argues that clear safeguards are required to ensure that future eu development policy serves both global development and european foreign policy goals . the lisbon treaty requires that european union foreign policy does no harm to development objectives , while calling for development cooperation to be conducted within the framework of external action .
the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .

ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .

the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .

the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .
coordinating cooperation second , the eeas should be part of a coordinated intra-eu development cooperation structure .
the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .
replacing ring-fences with safeguards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official development aid from europe increased in 2009 , despite the financial crisis the european commission is the appropriate body to ensure that development is safeguarded as its responsibilities for managing oda are enshrined in the eu treaties .
dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .
development power europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- is a leading european thinktank the lisbon treaty marks a milestone in the emergence of the eu as an international actor .
the blueprint for achieving a greater global role is not to try to ” speak with one voice ” on every issue , but to focus on the eu 's strengths in policy areas where it can make a difference .
as a development actor the eu has huge resources and more reach than individual member states .
the eu is also better at repetitive legalese than at mobilising hard power .
this does not capture headlines but is essential for pursuing global development objectives .
the full implications of the lisbon treaty are not yet clear , but the trend towards integration in eu external relations , development and foreign policy is real , and development will have an increasingly important role .
many of europe 's foreign policy and security interests are also development issues : state fragility and illegal migration are just two examples .
those tasked with designing the eu 's external relations architecture have a unique opportunity to serve global development and european foreign policy goals simultaneously .
clearer institutional safeguards for eu development policy would make an important contribution on both fronts .

the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .

“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .

the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .

and that has led to cries of imbalance from countries in the african union .
but president of the chamber of preliminary proceedings in the hague , german judge hans peter kaul says there is nothing unfair about the cases the court has chosen to pursue .
“ there are very simple reasons why crimes in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo and in the central african republic are being investigated . ”
in the three examples kaul cites , the governments themselves referred them to the icc because they recognised a need for help in processing crimes committed on their turf .
cautious optimism nonetheless , the process of pinpointing individual perpetrators is difficult , not least because it is simultaneously a judgement on the misconduct of the relevant nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc issued an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir which is why some states feel an extended jurisdiction of the court could encroach on their sovereignty .
not least when the proposed extension relates to the contentious issue of crimes of aggression .
while the icc officially has jurisdiction over state aggression , the 111 member states have never formally agreed on the definition of the crime .
it is hoped they will do so during the kampala conference .
speaking ahead of the meeting , president of the icc 's assembly of state parties , christian wenaweser said he was " cautiously optimistic " that member states could reach a deal on the controversial issue .
he said it would be " a significant step forward in the development of international law and an important extension of the court 's jurisdiction . "
definitive definition informally delegates have agreed that only state and army leaders could be indicted and only if the war of aggression were in breach of the un charter .
but the real challenge is to determine who has the power to decide whether a war is just and initiate an investigation accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council france , england and the us say the job should fall to the un security council .
but as wenaweser explains , not everyone wants the same thing .
" some countries view it as an exclusive security council right , " he said .
" but others say it would lead to the politicisation of the icc . " in the case of the former , the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , china , france and england could stop the icc from indicting their own citizens or their allies by using their power of veto .
until now germany has been opposed to such a role for the security council .
but there are others in kampala who are for it , so for the time being it 's a case of wait and see .

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beggars have been detained as the authorities try to " clean up " the city deplorable living and working conditions the authorities have also turned a blind eye to the working conditions for thousands of workers , many of whom do not even earn the minimum wage and are forced to work in an unsafe environment .
anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .
wherever they can not remove the slums , they will put up lovely bamboo screens so that tourists and sports people do not see the unseemly sight .
the work and living conditions are terrible .
there is no safety for children .
women are turned away because they do not want children hanging around on the sites . "
delayed payment of wages rajendra kumar , a migrant labourer from rajasthan , has been working on beautifying roads for the past six months with a group from his village .
he says contractors have not been paying him on time and also paying less than the stipulated wages .
" i do n't understand this .
sometimes they say i will get paid after a week and then they postpone that .
it is tough when you do n't get money on time .
the contractors make fools of us .
there are a lot of problems but we have no choice .
we need to eat at the end of the day . "
a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .
high security during commonwealth games security for the games is another major concern .
there will be over 2,000 cctv cameras set up on roads as well as hundreds inside the competition venues to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commonwealth games mascot ' shera ' but security expert ajay sahni said the games would be safe saying that there was enough capacity and " a tremendous concentration of intelligence activity preceding the games . "
the games are expected to cost the organizers over 15 billion us dollars .
however , in view of the discomfort to many , some are wondering whether the cost of this massive facelift is really worth it and equal to the pride that hosting the commonwealth games will bring .
the commonwealth games will take place from 3 to 14 october 2010 .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .

eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .

" basically we are working on cases in congo , uganda , central african republic , darfur and now we are requesting the judges to start an investigation into kenya . "

the documentary won its first prize shortly after it arrived in movie theatres in the fall of 2009 .
the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .
it was a newspaper clip that got me interested , ” says boote .
“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
it ’ s a chemical substance from the production of plastics that people suspect causes allergies and influences the hormonal system . ”
this was a defining moment for boote , who then decided to look more intensively at how plastics can threaten our health and the environment .
the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .
the reaction from the plastics industry also shows that it is time to take boote seriously .
for 18 months , “ plasticseurope ” didn ’ t respond to any of his phone calls .
but the premiere of the film was important enough for them to create five-page dossier : suggestions on how to respond and react to the film .
boote uses shocking scenes in his documentary and delivers many facts .
for example , that 40 years ago , five million tons of plastic were produced in europe .
today it is 60 million tons – one-fourth of the total world production .
at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , the austrian filmmaker wants to use constructive criticism : “ we have to ask ourselves : what do i really need ?
how can i contribute ?
at some point you will realize that it ’ s cool to think about consumption . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .

since then it has opened investigations into five situations in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo , the central african republic , darfur and kenya , and has issued arrest warrants for thirteen people .
four of them are in custody , two have died and the rest remain at large .
ahead of the kampala review conference , the court 's chief prosecutor argentinean lawyer luis moreno ocampo , said the world had moved a couple of steps closer to ending impunity for grave crimes , but that there is still plenty to be done .
" basically we are working on cases in congo , uganda , central african republic , darfur and now we are requesting the judges to start an investigation into kenya . "
ocampo said , adding that the court is also currently assessing situations in colombia , ivory coast , afghanistan , palestine and georgia .
us still holding back in the 12 years since the rome statute was first adopted , 111 of the 192 united nations states have become members of the icc .
a further 39 have signed but not yet ratified the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama is sending observers to the review conference among those that have resisted the court altogether are sudan , iraq , iran , israel , cuba and saudia arabia .
and of course , the us .
washington has long refused to become a signatory and back in its day , the bush administration went so far as to pressure other countries to follow its lead .
benjamin ferencz , a former nazi war crimes investigator and chief prosecutor at the nuremberg trials in 1946 is fiercely critical of the us stance towards the court .
" if any country violates the law they should be tried , whether they be the united states or israel or china or anybody else , " ferencz said .
" that is what law means , you lay down the law and those who violate it are held accountable . "
good for the us , good for the world while the obama administration has not continued with the sabotage campaign of the bush era , the new president has not gone the extra mile and agreed to join .
on the contrary , he remains opposed to the icc on the grounds that to join could be to subject its soldiers to arbitrary indictments and arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in afghanistan but david scheffer , who participated in the original rome statute negotiations , rejects obama 's reasoning out of hand .
he says the us military stands to benefit from a process that helps to make other countries comply with the laws of war .
" an international criminal court is fundamental force protection for the united states military , " scheffer said .
at the kampala conference , delegates will be looking at how effective the court can really be in helping to resolve domestic conflicts and how it can best contribute to the prevention of future crimes . in that vein , last year ocampo issued an international arrest warrant against sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
but many arab and african governments have continued their relations with him regardless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon even the united nations secretary general ban ki moon sent its top two officials in sudan to attend bashir 's swearing-in ceremony last week following his re-election to a second term in office .
the move was considered controversial among many un countries and a sign that in the case of sudan at least , the icc does not have the power it might like .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2010 who takes aim at tobacco ads targeting women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young and female : a key target group for tobacco firms the tobacco industry is trying to convert more women to smoking , says the world health organization .
on this year 's world no tobacco day , the group has created a counter-campaign to combat the trend . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has put cigarette advertising aimed at women at the center of its annual world no tobacco day .
the organization says the tobacco industry is unscrupulous in its attempts to market cigarettes to young women in general , especially in the developing world .
douglas bettcher , the director of the who 's tobacco free initiative , told deutsche welle that the prevalence of deadly diseases among smokers , such as cancer , emphysema , and heart disease , means the tobacco industry is " always looking for new populations , such as young women , to light up and support their profit motives . "
and the group 's web site claims that " women are the main targets of the tobacco industry 's efforts to win new consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakarta , indonesia was blasted for its laissez-faire smoking rules there is certainly more room for growth in the market for female smokers , statistics show .
across the world , just 9 percent of women and 40 percent of men currently smoke .
meanwhile , a who study of 151 countries shows 7 percent of adolescent girls smoke , compared with 12 percent of adolescent boys .
female smokers are catching up to male smokers , according to statistics .
in several countries - including , in europe , bulgaria , croatia , and the czech republic - the number of female tobacco users outweighs the male users , the who study showed .
counter-campaign trades beauty for illness the trend is worrisome , who says .
its new report entitled " women and health : today 's evidence , tomorrow 's agenda , " cites evidence that tobacco advertising increasingly targets girls .
thus for this year 's world no tobacco day , the health agency decided to highlight the tobacco industry 's tactics of associating tobacco use with beauty and freedom in its advertising .
one part of this year 's campaign was creating a series of hard-hitting posters that show attractive , but extremely ill , smokers , such as a model with mouth cancer or a tracheotomy tube .
" this campaign calls attention to the tobacco industry 's attempts to market its deadly products by associating tobacco use with beauty and liberation , " who assistant director-general for noncommunicable diseases and mental health , ala alwan , said .
cigarette marketing has become especially unscrupulous in parts of africa and asia , said adepju olukoya , who works on gender and health issues for who .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking women were often considered sophisticated " the industry has studied what makes women tick in both developed and developing countries .
in many developing countries especially , the young people want to be part of the global advance of fashion , in music , in being ' with it ' , " she told deutsche welle .
" so the tobacco industry uses this effectively by promoting sports events and concert events that draw young people - both male and female , " she added . sobering statistics challenging the millions of dollars spent on cigarette marketing wo n't be easy , but the who is trying .
even though it is unlikely that its posters will be seen by as many young women as see the cigarette advertisements , the organization hopes they will deter at least some women from lighting up .
" the world no tobacco day -lrb- poster -rrb- campaign seeks to turn the tables on the tobacco industry , showing tobacco use in its true light , " who 's bettcher said .
" no one should be fooled ...
tobacco is not stylish .
it is deadly and addictive . "
tobacco use kills more than five million people every year , about 1.5 million of whom are women , who says .
about half of long-term smokers die from tobacco related illness , the group says .
in general , statistics show women are more vulnerable to tobacco-related illnesses , according to germany 's federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- .
the group says second-hand smoke is a particular threat to women , especially pregnant women and their babies .
according to bzga , 26 percent of german women and 34 percent of german men are smokers .
long history of women and tobacco the who 's poster campaign is just the latest salvo in a long fight between health agencies and the tobacco industry over the targeting of women and girls .
in the 1920s , lucky strike cigarettes first linked smoking to weight control by urging women to " reach for a lucky instead of a sweet . "
in the 1960s , philip morris introduced virginia slims , the first cigarette brand created specifically for women and targeted to that consumer group .
and in the 1970s , tobacco companies targeted women with ads implying that " light " and " low tar " cigarettes were safer for consumption - despite knowing this was not the case , the us anti-smoking advocacy group tobacco free kids says .

i think at the moment europe should prevent such countries as poland , hungary and romania from joining the single currency .
these countries are not well-developed and have plenty of economic problems , and with the current crisis , it will weaken the euro even further .
i think it would be wise to wait for the economic situation in europe in general and in these countries in particular to improve .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer politics -pipe- 31.05.2010 former german president koehler leaves mostly positive legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler was first elected in 2004 in a surprise announcement , german president horst koehler has resigned from his post .
although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

on this year 's world no tobacco day , the group has created a counter-campaign to combat the trend . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has put cigarette advertising aimed at women at the center of its annual world no tobacco day .
the organization says the tobacco industry is unscrupulous in its attempts to market cigarettes to young women in general , especially in the developing world .
douglas bettcher , the director of the who 's tobacco free initiative , told deutsche welle that the prevalence of deadly diseases among smokers , such as cancer , emphysema , and heart disease , means the tobacco industry is " always looking for new populations , such as young women , to light up and support their profit motives . "
and the group 's web site claims that " women are the main targets of the tobacco industry 's efforts to win new consumers . "

one part of this year 's campaign was creating a series of hard-hitting posters that show attractive , but extremely ill , smokers , such as a model with mouth cancer or a tracheotomy tube .

even though it is unlikely that its posters will be seen by as many young women as see the cigarette advertisements , the organization hopes they will deter at least some women from lighting up .
" the world no tobacco day -lrb- poster -rrb- campaign seeks to turn the tables on the tobacco industry , showing tobacco use in its true light , " who 's bettcher said .
" no one should be fooled ...

it is deadly and addictive . "
tobacco use kills more than five million people every year , about 1.5 million of whom are women , who says .
about half of long-term smokers die from tobacco related illness , the group says .
in general , statistics show women are more vulnerable to tobacco-related illnesses , according to germany 's federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- .

female smokers are catching up to male smokers , according to statistics .
in several countries - including , in europe , bulgaria , croatia , and the czech republic - the number of female tobacco users outweighs the male users , the who study showed .
counter-campaign trades beauty for illness the trend is worrisome , who says .
its new report entitled " women and health : today 's evidence , tomorrow 's agenda , " cites evidence that tobacco advertising increasingly targets girls .
thus for this year 's world no tobacco day , the health agency decided to highlight the tobacco industry 's tactics of associating tobacco use with beauty and freedom in its advertising .
one part of this year 's campaign was creating a series of hard-hitting posters that show attractive , but extremely ill , smokers , such as a model with mouth cancer or a tracheotomy tube .
" this campaign calls attention to the tobacco industry 's attempts to market its deadly products by associating tobacco use with beauty and liberation , " who assistant director-general for noncommunicable diseases and mental health , ala alwan , said .
cigarette marketing has become especially unscrupulous in parts of africa and asia , said adepju olukoya , who works on gender and health issues for who .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking women were often considered sophisticated " the industry has studied what makes women tick in both developed and developing countries .
in many developing countries especially , the young people want to be part of the global advance of fashion , in music , in being ' with it ' , " she told deutsche welle .
" so the tobacco industry uses this effectively by promoting sports events and concert events that draw young people - both male and female , " she added . sobering statistics challenging the millions of dollars spent on cigarette marketing wo n't be easy , but the who is trying .
even though it is unlikely that its posters will be seen by as many young women as see the cigarette advertisements , the organization hopes they will deter at least some women from lighting up .
" the world no tobacco day -lrb- poster -rrb- campaign seeks to turn the tables on the tobacco industry , showing tobacco use in its true light , " who 's bettcher said .
" no one should be fooled ...
tobacco is not stylish .
it is deadly and addictive . "
tobacco use kills more than five million people every year , about 1.5 million of whom are women , who says .
about half of long-term smokers die from tobacco related illness , the group says .
in general , statistics show women are more vulnerable to tobacco-related illnesses , according to germany 's federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- .
the group says second-hand smoke is a particular threat to women , especially pregnant women and their babies .
according to bzga , 26 percent of german women and 34 percent of german men are smokers .
long history of women and tobacco the who 's poster campaign is just the latest salvo in a long fight between health agencies and the tobacco industry over the targeting of women and girls .
in the 1920s , lucky strike cigarettes first linked smoking to weight control by urging women to " reach for a lucky instead of a sweet . "
in the 1960s , philip morris introduced virginia slims , the first cigarette brand created specifically for women and targeted to that consumer group .
and in the 1970s , tobacco companies targeted women with ads implying that " light " and " low tar " cigarettes were safer for consumption - despite knowing this was not the case , the us anti-smoking advocacy group tobacco free kids says .

the documentary won its first prize shortly after it arrived in movie theatres in the fall of 2009 .
the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .
it was a newspaper clip that got me interested , ” says boote .
“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
it ’ s a chemical substance from the production of plastics that people suspect causes allergies and influences the hormonal system . ”
this was a defining moment for boote , who then decided to look more intensively at how plastics can threaten our health and the environment .
the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .
the reaction from the plastics industry also shows that it is time to take boote seriously .
for 18 months , “ plasticseurope ” didn ’ t respond to any of his phone calls .
but the premiere of the film was important enough for them to create five-page dossier : suggestions on how to respond and react to the film .
boote uses shocking scenes in his documentary and delivers many facts .
for example , that 40 years ago , five million tons of plastic were produced in europe .
today it is 60 million tons – one-fourth of the total world production .
at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , the austrian filmmaker wants to use constructive criticism : “ we have to ask ourselves : what do i really need ?
how can i contribute ?
at some point you will realize that it ’ s cool to think about consumption . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .
co-host of the deutsche welle global media forum is the foundation for international dialogue of the sparkasse in bonn .
the convention is also supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office , the family , women and integration ministry of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , european funds for regional development , the city of bonn , dhl , the ksb group and faber-castell . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer is to stand down after the bonn talks poor countries set new demands developing countries , meanwhile , have raised new demands and pressed developed countries to take greater responsibility for climate change .
in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer politics -pipe- 31.05.2010 former german president koehler leaves mostly positive legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler was first elected in 2004 in a surprise announcement , german president horst koehler has resigned from his post .
although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '
freudenheim told deutsche welle .

" what other novels about ordinary germans in wartime do we know ? " asked schillinger rhetorically . in her review , schillinger writes that to read the novel is " to be accompanied by a wise , somber ghost who grips your shoulder and whispers into your ear : ' this is how it was .
this is what happened . " ' intense texts from a troubled mind hans fallada was born as rudolf ditzen in the german city of greifswald in 1893 .
his pseudonym derives from a combination of characters found in grimm 's fairy tales .
from adolescence onwards , his life was marked by accidents , illness , drug addiction and mental instability , leading to several stints in insane asylums .
he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .
today , the novel is considered to be a modern classic , due to its intense descriptions of the last days of the weimer republic . great for some , ' bourgeois ' for others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " little man , what now ? " has been fallada 's best-known work till now despite his literary successes , fallada 's works have gone unheeded by german critics .

freudenheim told deutsche welle .
" it 's a great , memorable novel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the novel has been a success in both the uk and the us in a recent segment dedicated to the novel on the american tv talk show " charlie rose , " new york times book reviewer liesl schillinger pointed out that while much has been written about world war ii , the fate of ordinary german citizens during that time remains largely unaddressed . " what other novels about ordinary germans in wartime do we know ? " asked schillinger rhetorically . in her review , schillinger writes that to read the novel is " to be accompanied by a wise , somber ghost who grips your shoulder and whispers into your ear : ' this is how it was .
this is what happened . " ' intense texts from a troubled mind hans fallada was born as rudolf ditzen in the german city of greifswald in 1893 .
his pseudonym derives from a combination of characters found in grimm 's fairy tales .
from adolescence onwards , his life was marked by accidents , illness , drug addiction and mental instability , leading to several stints in insane asylums .
he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .
today , the novel is considered to be a modern classic , due to its intense descriptions of the last days of the weimer republic . great for some , ' bourgeois ' for others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " little man , what now ? " has been fallada 's best-known work till now despite his literary successes , fallada 's works have gone unheeded by german critics .
this " could be due to the fact that fallada is particularly good at describing everyday life and ordinary people , " andrea doberenz , a spokeswoman for fallada 's german publisher aufbau verlag , told deutsche welle . " this could be seen as bourgeois , but , as always , it 's a matter of perception , " added doberenz . nevertheless , doberenz emphasizes that fallada 's work has already been well received in germany since the 1970 's , but for this same reason it does not have the " boom potential " on home soil that it is now having abroad . however , a different kind of fallada renaissance is currently taking place in germany - in the form of stage adaptations of his works , most notably the play " little man , what now ?

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 31.05.2010 little-known german author lands posthumous bestseller abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fallada knew the realities of world war ii in germany from his own experience sixty-three years after his death , a new english translation of hans fallada 's novel about an anti-nazi resistance movement has found thousands of readers .
its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '

i think it is possible to accept new members in the eurozone , if those members can make the region stronger .
in the short term there will be many problems , but in the long term , the eurozone can benefit from them. have a nice day . - name : ala maleika - country : belarus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dear made in germany team , i love your show and never miss a chance to watch it .
i would like to take a change and answer your question of the week .
i think at the moment europe should prevent such countries as poland , hungary and romania from joining the single currency .
these countries are not well-developed and have plenty of economic problems , and with the current crisis , it will weaken the euro even further .
i think it would be wise to wait for the economic situation in europe in general and in these countries in particular to improve .

but the country 's constitution has clear guidelines on what happens next - and a power vacuum is not in sight . president horst koehler 's resignation is an unheard-of event in germany , but it will not result in a power vacuum .
according to the constitution , the head of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany 's federal states , takes over at this point .
every year , one of the 16 state premiers takes on the position of bundesrat president .
the present incumbent is jens boehrnsen , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- mayor of bremen .
boehrnsen will take over all of the federal president 's duties until an electoral college , the federal convention , elects a successor for koehler .
the federal convention must convene within 30 days - in this case , by june 30 . the federal convention is germany 's largest parliamentary body , and is solely responsible for the selection of the federal president .
all of the members of the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , are entitled to vote , as well as a corresponding number of representatives from the federal states .
the convention last met a year ago , in may 2009 , to re-elect koehler . then , it numbered 1,224 delegates .
germany could be in for a difficult vote the federal president is elected by secret ballot , without a prior debate , and requires an absolute majority .
should none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round , then the candidate who receives a simple majority in a third round of voting is considered elected as president .
germany 's head of state is not elected by the people .
as a rule , the political parties suggest candidates , not necessarily someone from within their ranks but a respected public figure capable of representing germany across party boundaries .
horst koehler , for instance , was supported by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the current ruling coalition in berlin .
this presidential election promises to be interesting because of the unclear situation in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which dispatches the greatest number of delegates to the federal convention .
the newly-elected parliament in duesseldorf does not have a governing majority yet , as coalition talks are still underway .
the result of these talks could have an effect on which way the nrw delegates votes . as a rule , federal convention delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice , but generally , they do adhere to their respective parties ' recommendations . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- db -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 31.05.2010 workers and slum dwellers bear brunt of commonwealth games preparations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the site of the national stadium , the venue for hockey matches the authorities want to present the indian capital as a world-class city but the rapid , deadline-driven overhaul has led to concerns about the plight of construction workers and slum dwellers who have been evicted . the countdown has started but delhi still looks like a messy construction site , with roads filled with rubble .
in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beggars have been detained as the authorities try to " clean up " the city deplorable living and working conditions the authorities have also turned a blind eye to the working conditions for thousands of workers , many of whom do not even earn the minimum wage and are forced to work in an unsafe environment .
anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .
wherever they can not remove the slums , they will put up lovely bamboo screens so that tourists and sports people do not see the unseemly sight .
the work and living conditions are terrible .
there is no safety for children .
women are turned away because they do not want children hanging around on the sites . "
delayed payment of wages rajendra kumar , a migrant labourer from rajasthan , has been working on beautifying roads for the past six months with a group from his village .
he says contractors have not been paying him on time and also paying less than the stipulated wages .
" i do n't understand this .
sometimes they say i will get paid after a week and then they postpone that .
it is tough when you do n't get money on time .
the contractors make fools of us .
there are a lot of problems but we have no choice .
we need to eat at the end of the day . "
a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .
high security during commonwealth games security for the games is another major concern .
there will be over 2,000 cctv cameras set up on roads as well as hundreds inside the competition venues to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commonwealth games mascot ' shera ' but security expert ajay sahni said the games would be safe saying that there was enough capacity and " a tremendous concentration of intelligence activity preceding the games . "
the games are expected to cost the organizers over 15 billion us dollars .
however , in view of the discomfort to many , some are wondering whether the cost of this massive facelift is really worth it and equal to the pride that hosting the commonwealth games will bring .
the commonwealth games will take place from 3 to 14 october 2010 .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .
a new president will need to be sworn in by june 30. gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beggars have been detained as the authorities try to " clean up " the city deplorable living and working conditions the authorities have also turned a blind eye to the working conditions for thousands of workers , many of whom do not even earn the minimum wage and are forced to work in an unsafe environment .
anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .
wherever they can not remove the slums , they will put up lovely bamboo screens so that tourists and sports people do not see the unseemly sight .
the work and living conditions are terrible .
there is no safety for children .
women are turned away because they do not want children hanging around on the sites . "
delayed payment of wages rajendra kumar , a migrant labourer from rajasthan , has been working on beautifying roads for the past six months with a group from his village .
he says contractors have not been paying him on time and also paying less than the stipulated wages .
" i do n't understand this .
sometimes they say i will get paid after a week and then they postpone that .
it is tough when you do n't get money on time .
the contractors make fools of us .
there are a lot of problems but we have no choice .
we need to eat at the end of the day . "
a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .
high security during commonwealth games security for the games is another major concern .
there will be over 2,000 cctv cameras set up on roads as well as hundreds inside the competition venues to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commonwealth games mascot ' shera ' but security expert ajay sahni said the games would be safe saying that there was enough capacity and " a tremendous concentration of intelligence activity preceding the games . "
the games are expected to cost the organizers over 15 billion us dollars .
however , in view of the discomfort to many , some are wondering whether the cost of this massive facelift is really worth it and equal to the pride that hosting the commonwealth games will bring .
the commonwealth games will take place from 3 to 14 october 2010 .

brussels wants to see biometric passports for russian citizens and stronger security along russia ’ s southern borders before relaxing its visa requirements . the eu also announced before the summit that it is keen to contribute money to anti-corruption initiatives and judiciary reform in russia , although no figures were named . energy and economy energy will also dominate the agenda as talks get underway on tuesday .
the eu and russia currently support competing pipeline projects nabucco and south stream , both of which plan to begin pumping gas to europe . the summit , held twice a year , will be overshadowed by the current economic crisis that is gripping several eu member-nations and has not escaped russia ’ s attention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 31.05.2010 eu demands inquiry after israeli raid on ships , turkey outraged großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flotilla was carrying hundreds of activists and tons of humanitarian aid the european union has demanded israel mount a " full inquiry " into the killing of at least 10 people after israeli commandos boarded ships carrying pro-palestinian activists and aid to the gaza strip . the european union 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton , has called on israeli authorities to launch a " full inquiry " into the killing of at least 10 people during a night raid on a convoy of aid ships destined for the gaza strip .
ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .
" at first glance it does not look like this basic rule was adhered to . "
germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle said he was " deeply concerned about the events last night in the waters off gaza ... these are disconcerting initial reports . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said " nothing can justify " the violence .
ambassadors from the 27 eu member nations were to hold an emergency meeting monday afternoon to discuss the incident .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt on monday said it was important to " quickly establish " what happened on the boats .
he said he had summoned the israeli ambassador to get more information .
he said that he had been in touch with ashton , and that the eu must give " a clear response during the day when we get a clearer picture of what has happened . "
authorities in spain and greece have also summoned the israeli ambassadors in their countries for information .
greek government officials announced that they would withdraw from planned joint military exercises with israel in protest .
turkish outrage turkey 's foreign ministry warned of " irreparable consequences " after the incident and announced at midday that they would be recalling their ambassador to israel .
some of the ships were sailing under turkish flags and media reports indicate that turkish nationals are among the dead .
" by targeting civilians , israel has once again shown its disregard for human life and peaceful initiatives .
we strongly condemn these inhumane practices of israel , " the turkish foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this deplorable incident , which took place in open sees and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law , may lead to irreparable consequences in our bilateral relations . "
bildunterschrift : many of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to israeli hospitals turkey has long been an important ally of israel , one of only a few in the muslim world .
but relations have declined since israel 's attack on gaza a year and a half ago , in which some 1,400 palestinians died and of which turkey was very critical .
on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .
in another demonstration , a crowd of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the residence of israeli ambassador gabby levy in ankara shouting " damn israel " and reciting prayers .
dozens of police were on duty in front of the building .
deadly clashes the six-boat flotilla was organized by several groups , including a turkish human rights organization , and was said to be carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid , as well as pro-palestinian activists .
the ships were in international waters 124 kilometers off the coast of israel when they were intercepted by the israeli navy and boarded by commandos .
demonstrators on the ships clashed with the soldiers .
the israeli army said the demonstrators were armed with knives and clubs and that commandos opened fire after one person on the boat grabbed a weapon from a commando .
the death toll from the incident is unclear , but the israeli military said more than ten activists had been killed and dozens of activists and soldiers were injured .
israeli trade minister binyamin ben-eliezer voiced " regret at all the fatalities , " but added that soldiers had been " set upon with batons and tools , " which forced them to defend themselves .
hamas , the islamist group which controls the gaza strip , issued a call for an " uprising " of muslims and arabs across the world .
israel has imposed a blockade on gaza since 2007 , hoping to prevent weapons and bombmaking supplies from getting into the hands of militants .
but opponents of the measure and some nongovernmental organizations say the blockade has also prevented needed medical supplies and food from getting to the area , a claim israel has denied. svs / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i think it would be wise to wait for the economic situation in europe in general and in these countries in particular to improve .

its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '
freudenheim told deutsche welle .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the novel has been a success in both the uk and the us in a recent segment dedicated to the novel on the american tv talk show " charlie rose , " new york times book reviewer liesl schillinger pointed out that while much has been written about world war ii , the fate of ordinary german citizens during that time remains largely unaddressed . " what other novels about ordinary germans in wartime do we know ? " asked schillinger rhetorically . in her review , schillinger writes that to read the novel is " to be accompanied by a wise , somber ghost who grips your shoulder and whispers into your ear : ' this is how it was .

his pseudonym derives from a combination of characters found in grimm 's fairy tales .
from adolescence onwards , his life was marked by accidents , illness , drug addiction and mental instability , leading to several stints in insane asylums .
he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .
today , the novel is considered to be a modern classic , due to its intense descriptions of the last days of the weimer republic . great for some , ' bourgeois ' for others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " little man , what now ?

its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '
freudenheim told deutsche welle .

he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .
today , the novel is considered to be a modern classic , due to its intense descriptions of the last days of the weimer republic . great for some , ' bourgeois ' for others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " little man , what now ?

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer is to stand down after the bonn talks poor countries set new demands developing countries , meanwhile , have raised new demands and pressed developed countries to take greater responsibility for climate change .
in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "

analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .

in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .

the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa .

in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .
" at first glance it does not look like this basic rule was adhered to . "
germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle said he was " deeply concerned about the events last night in the waters off gaza ... these are disconcerting initial reports . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said " nothing can justify " the violence .
ambassadors from the 27 eu member nations were to hold an emergency meeting monday afternoon to discuss the incident .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt on monday said it was important to " quickly establish " what happened on the boats .
he said he had summoned the israeli ambassador to get more information .
he said that he had been in touch with ashton , and that the eu must give " a clear response during the day when we get a clearer picture of what has happened . "
authorities in spain and greece have also summoned the israeli ambassadors in their countries for information .
greek government officials announced that they would withdraw from planned joint military exercises with israel in protest .
turkish outrage turkey 's foreign ministry warned of " irreparable consequences " after the incident and announced at midday that they would be recalling their ambassador to israel .
some of the ships were sailing under turkish flags and media reports indicate that turkish nationals are among the dead .
" by targeting civilians , israel has once again shown its disregard for human life and peaceful initiatives .
we strongly condemn these inhumane practices of israel , " the turkish foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this deplorable incident , which took place in open sees and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law , may lead to irreparable consequences in our bilateral relations . "
bildunterschrift : many of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to israeli hospitals turkey has long been an important ally of israel , one of only a few in the muslim world .
but relations have declined since israel 's attack on gaza a year and a half ago , in which some 1,400 palestinians died and of which turkey was very critical .
on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .
in another demonstration , a crowd of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the residence of israeli ambassador gabby levy in ankara shouting " damn israel " and reciting prayers .
dozens of police were on duty in front of the building .
deadly clashes the six-boat flotilla was organized by several groups , including a turkish human rights organization , and was said to be carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid , as well as pro-palestinian activists .
the ships were in international waters 124 kilometers off the coast of israel when they were intercepted by the israeli navy and boarded by commandos .
demonstrators on the ships clashed with the soldiers .
the israeli army said the demonstrators were armed with knives and clubs and that commandos opened fire after one person on the boat grabbed a weapon from a commando .
the death toll from the incident is unclear , but the israeli military said more than ten activists had been killed and dozens of activists and soldiers were injured .
israeli trade minister binyamin ben-eliezer voiced " regret at all the fatalities , " but added that soldiers had been " set upon with batons and tools , " which forced them to defend themselves .
hamas , the islamist group which controls the gaza strip , issued a call for an " uprising " of muslims and arabs across the world .
israel has imposed a blockade on gaza since 2007 , hoping to prevent weapons and bombmaking supplies from getting into the hands of militants .
but opponents of the measure and some nongovernmental organizations say the blockade has also prevented needed medical supplies and food from getting to the area , a claim israel has denied. svs / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .

on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .
in another demonstration , a crowd of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the residence of israeli ambassador gabby levy in ankara shouting " damn israel " and reciting prayers .

demonstrators on the ships clashed with the soldiers .
the israeli army said the demonstrators were armed with knives and clubs and that commandos opened fire after one person on the boat grabbed a weapon from a commando .
the death toll from the incident is unclear , but the israeli military said more than ten activists had been killed and dozens of activists and soldiers were injured .

the documentary won its first prize shortly after it arrived in movie theatres in the fall of 2009 .
the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .
it was a newspaper clip that got me interested , ” says boote .
“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
it ’ s a chemical substance from the production of plastics that people suspect causes allergies and influences the hormonal system . ”
this was a defining moment for boote , who then decided to look more intensively at how plastics can threaten our health and the environment .
the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .
the reaction from the plastics industry also shows that it is time to take boote seriously .
for 18 months , “ plasticseurope ” didn ’ t respond to any of his phone calls .
but the premiere of the film was important enough for them to create five-page dossier : suggestions on how to respond and react to the film .
boote uses shocking scenes in his documentary and delivers many facts .
for example , that 40 years ago , five million tons of plastic were produced in europe .
today it is 60 million tons – one-fourth of the total world production .
at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , the austrian filmmaker wants to use constructive criticism : “ we have to ask ourselves : what do i really need ?
how can i contribute ?
at some point you will realize that it ’ s cool to think about consumption . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .

the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .
coordinating cooperation second , the eeas should be part of a coordinated intra-eu development cooperation structure .
the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .
replacing ring-fences with safeguards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official development aid from europe increased in 2009 , despite the financial crisis the european commission is the appropriate body to ensure that development is safeguarded as its responsibilities for managing oda are enshrined in the eu treaties .
dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .
development power europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- is a leading european thinktank the lisbon treaty marks a milestone in the emergence of the eu as an international actor .
the blueprint for achieving a greater global role is not to try to ” speak with one voice ” on every issue , but to focus on the eu 's strengths in policy areas where it can make a difference .
as a development actor the eu has huge resources and more reach than individual member states .
the eu is also better at repetitive legalese than at mobilising hard power .
this does not capture headlines but is essential for pursuing global development objectives .
the full implications of the lisbon treaty are not yet clear , but the trend towards integration in eu external relations , development and foreign policy is real , and development will have an increasingly important role .
many of europe 's foreign policy and security interests are also development issues : state fragility and illegal migration are just two examples .
those tasked with designing the eu 's external relations architecture have a unique opportunity to serve global development and european foreign policy goals simultaneously .
clearer institutional safeguards for eu development policy would make an important contribution on both fronts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2010 who takes aim at tobacco ads targeting women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young and female : a key target group for tobacco firms the tobacco industry is trying to convert more women to smoking , says the world health organization .
on this year 's world no tobacco day , the group has created a counter-campaign to combat the trend . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has put cigarette advertising aimed at women at the center of its annual world no tobacco day .
the organization says the tobacco industry is unscrupulous in its attempts to market cigarettes to young women in general , especially in the developing world .
douglas bettcher , the director of the who 's tobacco free initiative , told deutsche welle that the prevalence of deadly diseases among smokers , such as cancer , emphysema , and heart disease , means the tobacco industry is " always looking for new populations , such as young women , to light up and support their profit motives . "
and the group 's web site claims that " women are the main targets of the tobacco industry 's efforts to win new consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakarta , indonesia was blasted for its laissez-faire smoking rules there is certainly more room for growth in the market for female smokers , statistics show .
across the world , just 9 percent of women and 40 percent of men currently smoke .
meanwhile , a who study of 151 countries shows 7 percent of adolescent girls smoke , compared with 12 percent of adolescent boys .
female smokers are catching up to male smokers , according to statistics .
in several countries - including , in europe , bulgaria , croatia , and the czech republic - the number of female tobacco users outweighs the male users , the who study showed .
counter-campaign trades beauty for illness the trend is worrisome , who says .
its new report entitled " women and health : today 's evidence , tomorrow 's agenda , " cites evidence that tobacco advertising increasingly targets girls .
thus for this year 's world no tobacco day , the health agency decided to highlight the tobacco industry 's tactics of associating tobacco use with beauty and freedom in its advertising .
one part of this year 's campaign was creating a series of hard-hitting posters that show attractive , but extremely ill , smokers , such as a model with mouth cancer or a tracheotomy tube .
" this campaign calls attention to the tobacco industry 's attempts to market its deadly products by associating tobacco use with beauty and liberation , " who assistant director-general for noncommunicable diseases and mental health , ala alwan , said .
cigarette marketing has become especially unscrupulous in parts of africa and asia , said adepju olukoya , who works on gender and health issues for who .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking women were often considered sophisticated " the industry has studied what makes women tick in both developed and developing countries .
in many developing countries especially , the young people want to be part of the global advance of fashion , in music , in being ' with it ' , " she told deutsche welle .
" so the tobacco industry uses this effectively by promoting sports events and concert events that draw young people - both male and female , " she added . sobering statistics challenging the millions of dollars spent on cigarette marketing wo n't be easy , but the who is trying .
even though it is unlikely that its posters will be seen by as many young women as see the cigarette advertisements , the organization hopes they will deter at least some women from lighting up .
" the world no tobacco day -lrb- poster -rrb- campaign seeks to turn the tables on the tobacco industry , showing tobacco use in its true light , " who 's bettcher said .
" no one should be fooled ...
tobacco is not stylish .
it is deadly and addictive . "
tobacco use kills more than five million people every year , about 1.5 million of whom are women , who says .
about half of long-term smokers die from tobacco related illness , the group says .
in general , statistics show women are more vulnerable to tobacco-related illnesses , according to germany 's federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- .

on this year 's world no tobacco day , the group has created a counter-campaign to combat the trend . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has put cigarette advertising aimed at women at the center of its annual world no tobacco day .
the organization says the tobacco industry is unscrupulous in its attempts to market cigarettes to young women in general , especially in the developing world .
douglas bettcher , the director of the who 's tobacco free initiative , told deutsche welle that the prevalence of deadly diseases among smokers , such as cancer , emphysema , and heart disease , means the tobacco industry is " always looking for new populations , such as young women , to light up and support their profit motives . "
and the group 's web site claims that " women are the main targets of the tobacco industry 's efforts to win new consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakarta , indonesia was blasted for its laissez-faire smoking rules there is certainly more room for growth in the market for female smokers , statistics show .
across the world , just 9 percent of women and 40 percent of men currently smoke .
meanwhile , a who study of 151 countries shows 7 percent of adolescent girls smoke , compared with 12 percent of adolescent boys .
female smokers are catching up to male smokers , according to statistics .
in several countries - including , in europe , bulgaria , croatia , and the czech republic - the number of female tobacco users outweighs the male users , the who study showed .
counter-campaign trades beauty for illness the trend is worrisome , who says .
its new report entitled " women and health : today 's evidence , tomorrow 's agenda , " cites evidence that tobacco advertising increasingly targets girls .
thus for this year 's world no tobacco day , the health agency decided to highlight the tobacco industry 's tactics of associating tobacco use with beauty and freedom in its advertising .
one part of this year 's campaign was creating a series of hard-hitting posters that show attractive , but extremely ill , smokers , such as a model with mouth cancer or a tracheotomy tube .
" this campaign calls attention to the tobacco industry 's attempts to market its deadly products by associating tobacco use with beauty and liberation , " who assistant director-general for noncommunicable diseases and mental health , ala alwan , said .
cigarette marketing has become especially unscrupulous in parts of africa and asia , said adepju olukoya , who works on gender and health issues for who .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking women were often considered sophisticated " the industry has studied what makes women tick in both developed and developing countries .
in many developing countries especially , the young people want to be part of the global advance of fashion , in music , in being ' with it ' , " she told deutsche welle .
" so the tobacco industry uses this effectively by promoting sports events and concert events that draw young people - both male and female , " she added . sobering statistics challenging the millions of dollars spent on cigarette marketing wo n't be easy , but the who is trying .
even though it is unlikely that its posters will be seen by as many young women as see the cigarette advertisements , the organization hopes they will deter at least some women from lighting up .
" the world no tobacco day -lrb- poster -rrb- campaign seeks to turn the tables on the tobacco industry , showing tobacco use in its true light , " who 's bettcher said .
" no one should be fooled ...
tobacco is not stylish .
it is deadly and addictive . "
tobacco use kills more than five million people every year , about 1.5 million of whom are women , who says .
about half of long-term smokers die from tobacco related illness , the group says .
in general , statistics show women are more vulnerable to tobacco-related illnesses , according to germany 's federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- .
the group says second-hand smoke is a particular threat to women , especially pregnant women and their babies .
according to bzga , 26 percent of german women and 34 percent of german men are smokers .
long history of women and tobacco the who 's poster campaign is just the latest salvo in a long fight between health agencies and the tobacco industry over the targeting of women and girls .

since then it has opened investigations into five situations in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo , the central african republic , darfur and kenya , and has issued arrest warrants for thirteen people .
four of them are in custody , two have died and the rest remain at large .
ahead of the kampala review conference , the court 's chief prosecutor argentinean lawyer luis moreno ocampo , said the world had moved a couple of steps closer to ending impunity for grave crimes , but that there is still plenty to be done .
" basically we are working on cases in congo , uganda , central african republic , darfur and now we are requesting the judges to start an investigation into kenya . "

a national mission in recent years , german contestants have been no stranger to the bottom tier at europe 's top song competition .
german viewers were more inclined to poke fun at the event than tune in .
facing a downward spiral , the powers that be at public broadcaster ard - germany 's eurovision broadcaster - knew they had one big chance to turn things around .
in what seemed like a last-ditch effort , or an act of desperation , the station teamed up with private channel prosieben to put germany 's contestant for this year 's competition on air .
luck was on their side : popular german television personality stefan raab - who shares a well-documented love of music - took on the role as head judge in the preliminary talent search for 2010 . in another stroke of good fortune , raab proved to the competition at germany 's most popular casting show " dsds " that this kind of contest could be done - and done well - without humiliating the contestants along the way .
it 's the singer , not the song out of 4,500 aspiring competitors who applied to appear on the multi-part series " our star for oslo , " 10 made it through .
but it was clear from the very start that lena meyer-landrut had something that no other contestant had .
as stefan raab put it , " when she gets on stage , everything blossoms . "
technical perfection was n't what counted in the preliminary competition .
several of lena 's competitors were more polished singers , but lena 's charisma and contagious feel-good persona were one-of-a-kind .
her song for oslo , " satellite , " was a catchy but run-of-the mill piece of pop music .
it was the singer , not the song , that made the difference : lena 's performance got people to take a closer listen .
breaking the rules over the years , the eurovision song contest has created a parallel universe of kitsch and pomp .
the world 's biggest tv event , it features over-the-top performances , tacky costumes and songs that might be unbearable to anyone who lacks a secret fondness for bad music .
lena 's decision to opt out of the gaudy spectacle was a wise one - but it would only work for someone with her special charm .
where others relied on pyrotechnics and led outfits , lena took the stage as lena , pure and simple .
since february , she 's weathered the media circus , completed her school-leaving exams and recorded her first album , but lena still comes through as authentic - and anything but routine .
with a deliberate non-marketing strategy , she won over germany - and then the rest of europe .
a little lena in everyone little is known about lena 's personal life , and the singer is kept away from tabloid media - and that 's what makes her so relatable .
she 's confident , young , cheeky - a bit zany - but ambitious : who would n't want to be the very same way ?
we 've had enough of empty promises , media fabrications and artificial emotions .
let 's just enjoy the moment and be glad the lena phenomenon has bridged a generation gap , challenged the superstar top-model mold - and of course , that because of her , germany will have the honor of hosting next year 's eurovision song contest .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .

the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .

and that has led to cries of imbalance from countries in the african union .
but president of the chamber of preliminary proceedings in the hague , german judge hans peter kaul says there is nothing unfair about the cases the court has chosen to pursue .
“ there are very simple reasons why crimes in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo and in the central african republic are being investigated . ”
in the three examples kaul cites , the governments themselves referred them to the icc because they recognised a need for help in processing crimes committed on their turf .
cautious optimism nonetheless , the process of pinpointing individual perpetrators is difficult , not least because it is simultaneously a judgement on the misconduct of the relevant nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc issued an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir which is why some states feel an extended jurisdiction of the court could encroach on their sovereignty .
not least when the proposed extension relates to the contentious issue of crimes of aggression .
while the icc officially has jurisdiction over state aggression , the 111 member states have never formally agreed on the definition of the crime .
it is hoped they will do so during the kampala conference .
speaking ahead of the meeting , president of the icc 's assembly of state parties , christian wenaweser said he was " cautiously optimistic " that member states could reach a deal on the controversial issue .
he said it would be " a significant step forward in the development of international law and an important extension of the court 's jurisdiction . "
definitive definition informally delegates have agreed that only state and army leaders could be indicted and only if the war of aggression were in breach of the un charter .
but the real challenge is to determine who has the power to decide whether a war is just and initiate an investigation accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council france , england and the us say the job should fall to the un security council .
but as wenaweser explains , not everyone wants the same thing .
" some countries view it as an exclusive security council right , " he said .
" but others say it would lead to the politicisation of the icc . " in the case of the former , the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , china , france and england could stop the icc from indicting their own citizens or their allies by using their power of veto .
until now germany has been opposed to such a role for the security council .
but there are others in kampala who are for it , so for the time being it 's a case of wait and see .

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beggars have been detained as the authorities try to " clean up " the city deplorable living and working conditions the authorities have also turned a blind eye to the working conditions for thousands of workers , many of whom do not even earn the minimum wage and are forced to work in an unsafe environment .
anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .
wherever they can not remove the slums , they will put up lovely bamboo screens so that tourists and sports people do not see the unseemly sight .
the work and living conditions are terrible .
there is no safety for children .
women are turned away because they do not want children hanging around on the sites . "
delayed payment of wages rajendra kumar , a migrant labourer from rajasthan , has been working on beautifying roads for the past six months with a group from his village .
he says contractors have not been paying him on time and also paying less than the stipulated wages .
" i do n't understand this .
sometimes they say i will get paid after a week and then they postpone that .
it is tough when you do n't get money on time .
the contractors make fools of us .
there are a lot of problems but we have no choice .
we need to eat at the end of the day . "
a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .
high security during commonwealth games security for the games is another major concern .
there will be over 2,000 cctv cameras set up on roads as well as hundreds inside the competition venues to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commonwealth games mascot ' shera ' but security expert ajay sahni said the games would be safe saying that there was enough capacity and " a tremendous concentration of intelligence activity preceding the games . "
the games are expected to cost the organizers over 15 billion us dollars .
however , in view of the discomfort to many , some are wondering whether the cost of this massive facelift is really worth it and equal to the pride that hosting the commonwealth games will bring .
the commonwealth games will take place from 3 to 14 october 2010 .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

but the country 's constitution has clear guidelines on what happens next - and a power vacuum is not in sight . president horst koehler 's resignation is an unheard-of event in germany , but it will not result in a power vacuum .
according to the constitution , the head of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany 's federal states , takes over at this point .
every year , one of the 16 state premiers takes on the position of bundesrat president .
the present incumbent is jens boehrnsen , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- mayor of bremen .
boehrnsen will take over all of the federal president 's duties until an electoral college , the federal convention , elects a successor for koehler .
the federal convention must convene within 30 days - in this case , by june 30 . the federal convention is germany 's largest parliamentary body , and is solely responsible for the selection of the federal president .
all of the members of the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , are entitled to vote , as well as a corresponding number of representatives from the federal states .
the convention last met a year ago , in may 2009 , to re-elect koehler . then , it numbered 1,224 delegates .
germany could be in for a difficult vote the federal president is elected by secret ballot , without a prior debate , and requires an absolute majority .
should none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round , then the candidate who receives a simple majority in a third round of voting is considered elected as president .
germany 's head of state is not elected by the people .
as a rule , the political parties suggest candidates , not necessarily someone from within their ranks but a respected public figure capable of representing germany across party boundaries .
horst koehler , for instance , was supported by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the current ruling coalition in berlin .
this presidential election promises to be interesting because of the unclear situation in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which dispatches the greatest number of delegates to the federal convention .
the newly-elected parliament in duesseldorf does not have a governing majority yet , as coalition talks are still underway .
the result of these talks could have an effect on which way the nrw delegates votes . as a rule , federal convention delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice , but generally , they do adhere to their respective parties ' recommendations . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- db -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '

" what other novels about ordinary germans in wartime do we know ? " asked schillinger rhetorically . in her review , schillinger writes that to read the novel is " to be accompanied by a wise , somber ghost who grips your shoulder and whispers into your ear : ' this is how it was .

he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .
today , the novel is considered to be a modern classic , due to its intense descriptions of the last days of the weimer republic . great for some , ' bourgeois ' for others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " little man , what now ?

its success has greatly exceeded the publishers ' expectations . late german author hans fallada has often been dismissed by literary experts as a " bourgeois " writer , but now , over six decades after his death , his work is attracting international acclaim .
following the recent translation of his wartime novel - titled " alone in berlin " in the uk and " every man dies alone " in the united states - he has gained a large following in the english-speaking world . in the uk alone , 100,000 copies of the novel have been sold since its initial release in hardback in 2009 .
penguin classics , the novel 's uk publisher , expects to sell 250,000 copies by the end of this year .
for a country where translated novels usually account for only one percent of the book market 's sales volume , this is a particularly astonishing figure . ' a new , surprising angle ' based on a true story , the novel recounts how a working-class berlin couple , otto and anna quangel , become politically active when their only son dies in battle during world war ii .
they come up with their own resistance campaign : distributing anti-hitler postcards around berlin .
the pair is fully aware that being caught would cost them their lives . according to adam freudenheim , publisher for penguin classics and commissioner of the english translation , the novel offers " a new , surprising angle on world war ii , which is of course of perennial interest . " it also " forces you , the reader , to ask yourself the question , ' what would i have done if i 'd been in these circumstances ? " '
freudenheim told deutsche welle .

he died of a morphine overdose in 1947 . his most widely known work until now has been the novel " little man , what now ? "
published in 1932 , a year before adolf hitler 's rise to power , the book 's instant success was marred by fallada 's anxiety over the rise of nazism and a subsequent nervous breakdown .

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beggars have been detained as the authorities try to " clean up " the city deplorable living and working conditions the authorities have also turned a blind eye to the working conditions for thousands of workers , many of whom do not even earn the minimum wage and are forced to work in an unsafe environment .
anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .
wherever they can not remove the slums , they will put up lovely bamboo screens so that tourists and sports people do not see the unseemly sight .
the work and living conditions are terrible .
there is no safety for children .
women are turned away because they do not want children hanging around on the sites . "
delayed payment of wages rajendra kumar , a migrant labourer from rajasthan , has been working on beautifying roads for the past six months with a group from his village .
he says contractors have not been paying him on time and also paying less than the stipulated wages .
" i do n't understand this .
sometimes they say i will get paid after a week and then they postpone that .
it is tough when you do n't get money on time .
the contractors make fools of us .
there are a lot of problems but we have no choice .
we need to eat at the end of the day . "
a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .
high security during commonwealth games security for the games is another major concern .
there will be over 2,000 cctv cameras set up on roads as well as hundreds inside the competition venues to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commonwealth games mascot ' shera ' but security expert ajay sahni said the games would be safe saying that there was enough capacity and " a tremendous concentration of intelligence activity preceding the games . "
the games are expected to cost the organizers over 15 billion us dollars .
however , in view of the discomfort to many , some are wondering whether the cost of this massive facelift is really worth it and equal to the pride that hosting the commonwealth games will bring .
the commonwealth games will take place from 3 to 14 october 2010 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beggars have been detained as the authorities try to " clean up " the city deplorable living and working conditions the authorities have also turned a blind eye to the working conditions for thousands of workers , many of whom do not even earn the minimum wage and are forced to work in an unsafe environment .
anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .
wherever they can not remove the slums , they will put up lovely bamboo screens so that tourists and sports people do not see the unseemly sight .
the work and living conditions are terrible .
there is no safety for children .
women are turned away because they do not want children hanging around on the sites . "
delayed payment of wages rajendra kumar , a migrant labourer from rajasthan , has been working on beautifying roads for the past six months with a group from his village .
he says contractors have not been paying him on time and also paying less than the stipulated wages .
" i do n't understand this .
sometimes they say i will get paid after a week and then they postpone that .
it is tough when you do n't get money on time .
the contractors make fools of us .
there are a lot of problems but we have no choice .
we need to eat at the end of the day . "
a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .
high security during commonwealth games security for the games is another major concern .
there will be over 2,000 cctv cameras set up on roads as well as hundreds inside the competition venues to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors .

the games are expected to cost the organizers over 15 billion us dollars .
however , in view of the discomfort to many , some are wondering whether the cost of this massive facelift is really worth it and equal to the pride that hosting the commonwealth games will bring .
the commonwealth games will take place from 3 to 14 october 2010 .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer is to stand down after the bonn talks poor countries set new demands developing countries , meanwhile , have raised new demands and pressed developed countries to take greater responsibility for climate change .
in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .

the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .

in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "

is there something special that greece offers ?
nikitiadis : there are three or four very , very important reasons why a person should visit greece : one is that greece is one of the most beautiful countries in the world : nice beaches , nice sand .
everywhere you go in greece you face beauty .
the second reason : very , very few countries in the world offer a civilization like the one we offer .
the third basic reason is that our prices have fallen by more that 20 percent , becoming more competitive than at any other time .
people are scared to travel to greece after the violence especially with their families .
many people are afraid – because of the strikes for example - visiting greece could turn into an odyssey .
that 's far away from the reality , because greece has no more strikes than other countries in europe .
greek airlines and airlines operating in greece do not go on strike more than any other country .
and a couple of days ago we had an airline strike .
do n't forget the word " philoxenia " .
it 's a greek word .
it means " friend of the stranger , friend of somebody who comes from abroad " .
so i think there should n't be any concern at all .
greece is a very safe , a very secure place : at least just as secure as any other large european country .
a lot of germans are scared to visit greece because of worsening german-greek relations .

that is a problem for greece as the tourism sector is the country 's biggest source of foreign currency .
about 30,000 room reservations were cancelled in athens in may alone after protesters set fire to a bank , killing three people , according to the country 's hotel association pox .
deutsche welle talked to greek tourism minister georgios nikitiadis about the country 's debt crisis and the impact it has had on the tourism industry .
dw : why should a tourist visit greece , especially this year ?
is there something special that greece offers ?
nikitiadis : there are three or four very , very important reasons why a person should visit greece : one is that greece is one of the most beautiful countries in the world : nice beaches , nice sand .
everywhere you go in greece you face beauty .
the second reason : very , very few countries in the world offer a civilization like the one we offer .
the third basic reason is that our prices have fallen by more that 20 percent , becoming more competitive than at any other time .
people are scared to travel to greece after the violence especially with their families .
many people are afraid – because of the strikes for example - visiting greece could turn into an odyssey .
that 's far away from the reality , because greece has no more strikes than other countries in europe .
greek airlines and airlines operating in greece do not go on strike more than any other country .
and a couple of days ago we had an airline strike .
do n't forget the word " philoxenia " .
it 's a greek word .
it means " friend of the stranger , friend of somebody who comes from abroad " .
so i think there should n't be any concern at all .
greece is a very safe , a very secure place : at least just as secure as any other large european country .
a lot of germans are scared to visit greece because of worsening german-greek relations .
we love the german people , as we always did .
they are more than welcome .
we never had anything against the german people whatsoever .
i understand that there has been a lot of media coverage about german-greek relations reported in a number of publications .
but we know that the german people love us .
there is nothing that can come between us . "

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .
" at first glance it does not look like this basic rule was adhered to . "
germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle said he was " deeply concerned about the events last night in the waters off gaza ... these are disconcerting initial reports . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said " nothing can justify " the violence .
ambassadors from the 27 eu member nations were to hold an emergency meeting monday afternoon to discuss the incident .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt on monday said it was important to " quickly establish " what happened on the boats .
he said he had summoned the israeli ambassador to get more information .
he said that he had been in touch with ashton , and that the eu must give " a clear response during the day when we get a clearer picture of what has happened . "
authorities in spain and greece have also summoned the israeli ambassadors in their countries for information .
greek government officials announced that they would withdraw from planned joint military exercises with israel in protest .
turkish outrage turkey 's foreign ministry warned of " irreparable consequences " after the incident and announced at midday that they would be recalling their ambassador to israel .
some of the ships were sailing under turkish flags and media reports indicate that turkish nationals are among the dead .
" by targeting civilians , israel has once again shown its disregard for human life and peaceful initiatives .
we strongly condemn these inhumane practices of israel , " the turkish foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this deplorable incident , which took place in open sees and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law , may lead to irreparable consequences in our bilateral relations . "
bildunterschrift : many of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to israeli hospitals turkey has long been an important ally of israel , one of only a few in the muslim world .
but relations have declined since israel 's attack on gaza a year and a half ago , in which some 1,400 palestinians died and of which turkey was very critical .
on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .
in another demonstration , a crowd of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the residence of israeli ambassador gabby levy in ankara shouting " damn israel " and reciting prayers .
dozens of police were on duty in front of the building .
deadly clashes the six-boat flotilla was organized by several groups , including a turkish human rights organization , and was said to be carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid , as well as pro-palestinian activists .
the ships were in international waters 124 kilometers off the coast of israel when they were intercepted by the israeli navy and boarded by commandos .
demonstrators on the ships clashed with the soldiers .
the israeli army said the demonstrators were armed with knives and clubs and that commandos opened fire after one person on the boat grabbed a weapon from a commando .
the death toll from the incident is unclear , but the israeli military said more than ten activists had been killed and dozens of activists and soldiers were injured .
israeli trade minister binyamin ben-eliezer voiced " regret at all the fatalities , " but added that soldiers had been " set upon with batons and tools , " which forced them to defend themselves .
hamas , the islamist group which controls the gaza strip , issued a call for an " uprising " of muslims and arabs across the world .
israel has imposed a blockade on gaza since 2007 , hoping to prevent weapons and bombmaking supplies from getting into the hands of militants .
but opponents of the measure and some nongovernmental organizations say the blockade has also prevented needed medical supplies and food from getting to the area , a claim israel has denied. svs / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .
" at first glance it does not look like this basic rule was adhered to . "
germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle said he was " deeply concerned about the events last night in the waters off gaza ... these are disconcerting initial reports . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said " nothing can justify " the violence .
ambassadors from the 27 eu member nations were to hold an emergency meeting monday afternoon to discuss the incident .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt on monday said it was important to " quickly establish " what happened on the boats .
he said he had summoned the israeli ambassador to get more information .
he said that he had been in touch with ashton , and that the eu must give " a clear response during the day when we get a clearer picture of what has happened . "
authorities in spain and greece have also summoned the israeli ambassadors in their countries for information .
greek government officials announced that they would withdraw from planned joint military exercises with israel in protest .
turkish outrage turkey 's foreign ministry warned of " irreparable consequences " after the incident and announced at midday that they would be recalling their ambassador to israel .
some of the ships were sailing under turkish flags and media reports indicate that turkish nationals are among the dead .
" by targeting civilians , israel has once again shown its disregard for human life and peaceful initiatives .
we strongly condemn these inhumane practices of israel , " the turkish foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this deplorable incident , which took place in open sees and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law , may lead to irreparable consequences in our bilateral relations . "
bildunterschrift : many of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to israeli hospitals turkey has long been an important ally of israel , one of only a few in the muslim world .
but relations have declined since israel 's attack on gaza a year and a half ago , in which some 1,400 palestinians died and of which turkey was very critical .
on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .
in another demonstration , a crowd of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the residence of israeli ambassador gabby levy in ankara shouting " damn israel " and reciting prayers .
dozens of police were on duty in front of the building .
deadly clashes the six-boat flotilla was organized by several groups , including a turkish human rights organization , and was said to be carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid , as well as pro-palestinian activists .
the ships were in international waters 124 kilometers off the coast of israel when they were intercepted by the israeli navy and boarded by commandos .
demonstrators on the ships clashed with the soldiers .
the israeli army said the demonstrators were armed with knives and clubs and that commandos opened fire after one person on the boat grabbed a weapon from a commando .
the death toll from the incident is unclear , but the israeli military said more than ten activists had been killed and dozens of activists and soldiers were injured .
israeli trade minister binyamin ben-eliezer voiced " regret at all the fatalities , " but added that soldiers had been " set upon with batons and tools , " which forced them to defend themselves .
hamas , the islamist group which controls the gaza strip , issued a call for an " uprising " of muslims and arabs across the world .
israel has imposed a blockade on gaza since 2007 , hoping to prevent weapons and bombmaking supplies from getting into the hands of militants .
but opponents of the measure and some nongovernmental organizations say the blockade has also prevented needed medical supplies and food from getting to the area , a claim israel has denied. svs / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the documentary won its first prize shortly after it arrived in movie theatres in the fall of 2009 .
the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .
it was a newspaper clip that got me interested , ” says boote .
“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
it ’ s a chemical substance from the production of plastics that people suspect causes allergies and influences the hormonal system . ”
this was a defining moment for boote , who then decided to look more intensively at how plastics can threaten our health and the environment .
the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .
the reaction from the plastics industry also shows that it is time to take boote seriously .
for 18 months , “ plasticseurope ” didn ’ t respond to any of his phone calls .
but the premiere of the film was important enough for them to create five-page dossier : suggestions on how to respond and react to the film .
boote uses shocking scenes in his documentary and delivers many facts .
for example , that 40 years ago , five million tons of plastic were produced in europe .
today it is 60 million tons – one-fourth of the total world production .
at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , the austrian filmmaker wants to use constructive criticism : “ we have to ask ourselves : what do i really need ?
how can i contribute ?
at some point you will realize that it ’ s cool to think about consumption . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .
co-host of the deutsche welle global media forum is the foundation for international dialogue of the sparkasse in bonn .
the convention is also supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office , the family , women and integration ministry of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , european funds for regional development , the city of bonn , dhl , the ksb group and faber-castell . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 31.05.2010 opinion : the european external action service 's role in eu development policymaking requires safeguards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu aid service is to increase europe 's global role guest commentator mark furness argues that clear safeguards are required to ensure that future eu development policy serves both global development and european foreign policy goals . the lisbon treaty requires that european union foreign policy does no harm to development objectives , while calling for development cooperation to be conducted within the framework of external action .
the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .
coordinating cooperation second , the eeas should be part of a coordinated intra-eu development cooperation structure .
the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .
replacing ring-fences with safeguards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official development aid from europe increased in 2009 , despite the financial crisis the european commission is the appropriate body to ensure that development is safeguarded as its responsibilities for managing oda are enshrined in the eu treaties .
dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .
development power europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- is a leading european thinktank the lisbon treaty marks a milestone in the emergence of the eu as an international actor .
the blueprint for achieving a greater global role is not to try to ” speak with one voice ” on every issue , but to focus on the eu 's strengths in policy areas where it can make a difference .
as a development actor the eu has huge resources and more reach than individual member states .
the eu is also better at repetitive legalese than at mobilising hard power .
this does not capture headlines but is essential for pursuing global development objectives .
the full implications of the lisbon treaty are not yet clear , but the trend towards integration in eu external relations , development and foreign policy is real , and development will have an increasingly important role .
many of europe 's foreign policy and security interests are also development issues : state fragility and illegal migration are just two examples .
those tasked with designing the eu 's external relations architecture have a unique opportunity to serve global development and european foreign policy goals simultaneously .
clearer institutional safeguards for eu development policy would make an important contribution on both fronts .

the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .
coordinating cooperation second , the eeas should be part of a coordinated intra-eu development cooperation structure .
the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .
replacing ring-fences with safeguards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official development aid from europe increased in 2009 , despite the financial crisis the european commission is the appropriate body to ensure that development is safeguarded as its responsibilities for managing oda are enshrined in the eu treaties .
dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- is a leading european thinktank the lisbon treaty marks a milestone in the emergence of the eu as an international actor .
the blueprint for achieving a greater global role is not to try to ” speak with one voice ” on every issue , but to focus on the eu 's strengths in policy areas where it can make a difference .
as a development actor the eu has huge resources and more reach than individual member states .
the eu is also better at repetitive legalese than at mobilising hard power .
this does not capture headlines but is essential for pursuing global development objectives .
the full implications of the lisbon treaty are not yet clear , but the trend towards integration in eu external relations , development and foreign policy is real , and development will have an increasingly important role .
many of europe 's foreign policy and security interests are also development issues : state fragility and illegal migration are just two examples .
those tasked with designing the eu 's external relations architecture have a unique opportunity to serve global development and european foreign policy goals simultaneously .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2010 who takes aim at tobacco ads targeting women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young and female : a key target group for tobacco firms the tobacco industry is trying to convert more women to smoking , says the world health organization .
on this year 's world no tobacco day , the group has created a counter-campaign to combat the trend . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has put cigarette advertising aimed at women at the center of its annual world no tobacco day .
the organization says the tobacco industry is unscrupulous in its attempts to market cigarettes to young women in general , especially in the developing world .
douglas bettcher , the director of the who 's tobacco free initiative , told deutsche welle that the prevalence of deadly diseases among smokers , such as cancer , emphysema , and heart disease , means the tobacco industry is " always looking for new populations , such as young women , to light up and support their profit motives . "
and the group 's web site claims that " women are the main targets of the tobacco industry 's efforts to win new consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakarta , indonesia was blasted for its laissez-faire smoking rules there is certainly more room for growth in the market for female smokers , statistics show .
across the world , just 9 percent of women and 40 percent of men currently smoke .
meanwhile , a who study of 151 countries shows 7 percent of adolescent girls smoke , compared with 12 percent of adolescent boys .
female smokers are catching up to male smokers , according to statistics .
in several countries - including , in europe , bulgaria , croatia , and the czech republic - the number of female tobacco users outweighs the male users , the who study showed .
counter-campaign trades beauty for illness the trend is worrisome , who says .
its new report entitled " women and health : today 's evidence , tomorrow 's agenda , " cites evidence that tobacco advertising increasingly targets girls .
thus for this year 's world no tobacco day , the health agency decided to highlight the tobacco industry 's tactics of associating tobacco use with beauty and freedom in its advertising .
one part of this year 's campaign was creating a series of hard-hitting posters that show attractive , but extremely ill , smokers , such as a model with mouth cancer or a tracheotomy tube .
" this campaign calls attention to the tobacco industry 's attempts to market its deadly products by associating tobacco use with beauty and liberation , " who assistant director-general for noncommunicable diseases and mental health , ala alwan , said .
cigarette marketing has become especially unscrupulous in parts of africa and asia , said adepju olukoya , who works on gender and health issues for who .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking women were often considered sophisticated " the industry has studied what makes women tick in both developed and developing countries .
in many developing countries especially , the young people want to be part of the global advance of fashion , in music , in being ' with it ' , " she told deutsche welle .
" so the tobacco industry uses this effectively by promoting sports events and concert events that draw young people - both male and female , " she added . sobering statistics challenging the millions of dollars spent on cigarette marketing wo n't be easy , but the who is trying .
even though it is unlikely that its posters will be seen by as many young women as see the cigarette advertisements , the organization hopes they will deter at least some women from lighting up .
" the world no tobacco day -lrb- poster -rrb- campaign seeks to turn the tables on the tobacco industry , showing tobacco use in its true light , " who 's bettcher said .
" no one should be fooled ...
tobacco is not stylish .
it is deadly and addictive . "
tobacco use kills more than five million people every year , about 1.5 million of whom are women , who says .
about half of long-term smokers die from tobacco related illness , the group says .
in general , statistics show women are more vulnerable to tobacco-related illnesses , according to germany 's federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- .
the group says second-hand smoke is a particular threat to women , especially pregnant women and their babies .
according to bzga , 26 percent of german women and 34 percent of german men are smokers .
long history of women and tobacco the who 's poster campaign is just the latest salvo in a long fight between health agencies and the tobacco industry over the targeting of women and girls .
in the 1920s , lucky strike cigarettes first linked smoking to weight control by urging women to " reach for a lucky instead of a sweet . "

since then it has opened investigations into five situations in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo , the central african republic , darfur and kenya , and has issued arrest warrants for thirteen people .
four of them are in custody , two have died and the rest remain at large .
ahead of the kampala review conference , the court 's chief prosecutor argentinean lawyer luis moreno ocampo , said the world had moved a couple of steps closer to ending impunity for grave crimes , but that there is still plenty to be done .
" basically we are working on cases in congo , uganda , central african republic , darfur and now we are requesting the judges to start an investigation into kenya . "
ocampo said , adding that the court is also currently assessing situations in colombia , ivory coast , afghanistan , palestine and georgia .
us still holding back in the 12 years since the rome statute was first adopted , 111 of the 192 united nations states have become members of the icc .
a further 39 have signed but not yet ratified the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama is sending observers to the review conference among those that have resisted the court altogether are sudan , iraq , iran , israel , cuba and saudia arabia .
and of course , the us .
washington has long refused to become a signatory and back in its day , the bush administration went so far as to pressure other countries to follow its lead .
benjamin ferencz , a former nazi war crimes investigator and chief prosecutor at the nuremberg trials in 1946 is fiercely critical of the us stance towards the court .
" if any country violates the law they should be tried , whether they be the united states or israel or china or anybody else , " ferencz said .
" that is what law means , you lay down the law and those who violate it are held accountable . "
good for the us , good for the world while the obama administration has not continued with the sabotage campaign of the bush era , the new president has not gone the extra mile and agreed to join .
on the contrary , he remains opposed to the icc on the grounds that to join could be to subject its soldiers to arbitrary indictments and arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in afghanistan but david scheffer , who participated in the original rome statute negotiations , rejects obama 's reasoning out of hand .
he says the us military stands to benefit from a process that helps to make other countries comply with the laws of war .
" an international criminal court is fundamental force protection for the united states military , " scheffer said .
at the kampala conference , delegates will be looking at how effective the court can really be in helping to resolve domestic conflicts and how it can best contribute to the prevention of future crimes . in that vein , last year ocampo issued an international arrest warrant against sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
but many arab and african governments have continued their relations with him regardless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon even the united nations secretary general ban ki moon sent its top two officials in sudan to attend bashir 's swearing-in ceremony last week following his re-election to a second term in office .
the move was considered controversial among many un countries and a sign that in the case of sudan at least , the icc does not have the power it might like .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

but the country 's constitution has clear guidelines on what happens next - and a power vacuum is not in sight . president horst koehler 's resignation is an unheard-of event in germany , but it will not result in a power vacuum .
according to the constitution , the head of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany 's federal states , takes over at this point .
every year , one of the 16 state premiers takes on the position of bundesrat president .
the present incumbent is jens boehrnsen , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- mayor of bremen .
boehrnsen will take over all of the federal president 's duties until an electoral college , the federal convention , elects a successor for koehler .
the federal convention must convene within 30 days - in this case , by june 30 . the federal convention is germany 's largest parliamentary body , and is solely responsible for the selection of the federal president .
all of the members of the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , are entitled to vote , as well as a corresponding number of representatives from the federal states .
the convention last met a year ago , in may 2009 , to re-elect koehler . then , it numbered 1,224 delegates .
germany could be in for a difficult vote the federal president is elected by secret ballot , without a prior debate , and requires an absolute majority .
should none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round , then the candidate who receives a simple majority in a third round of voting is considered elected as president .
germany 's head of state is not elected by the people .
as a rule , the political parties suggest candidates , not necessarily someone from within their ranks but a respected public figure capable of representing germany across party boundaries .
horst koehler , for instance , was supported by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the current ruling coalition in berlin .
this presidential election promises to be interesting because of the unclear situation in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which dispatches the greatest number of delegates to the federal convention .
the newly-elected parliament in duesseldorf does not have a governing majority yet , as coalition talks are still underway .
the result of these talks could have an effect on which way the nrw delegates votes . as a rule , federal convention delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice , but generally , they do adhere to their respective parties ' recommendations . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- db -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a national mission in recent years , german contestants have been no stranger to the bottom tier at europe 's top song competition .
german viewers were more inclined to poke fun at the event than tune in .
facing a downward spiral , the powers that be at public broadcaster ard - germany 's eurovision broadcaster - knew they had one big chance to turn things around .
in what seemed like a last-ditch effort , or an act of desperation , the station teamed up with private channel prosieben to put germany 's contestant for this year 's competition on air .
luck was on their side : popular german television personality stefan raab - who shares a well-documented love of music - took on the role as head judge in the preliminary talent search for 2010 . in another stroke of good fortune , raab proved to the competition at germany 's most popular casting show " dsds " that this kind of contest could be done - and done well - without humiliating the contestants along the way .
it 's the singer , not the song out of 4,500 aspiring competitors who applied to appear on the multi-part series " our star for oslo , " 10 made it through .
but it was clear from the very start that lena meyer-landrut had something that no other contestant had .
as stefan raab put it , " when she gets on stage , everything blossoms . "
technical perfection was n't what counted in the preliminary competition .
several of lena 's competitors were more polished singers , but lena 's charisma and contagious feel-good persona were one-of-a-kind .
her song for oslo , " satellite , " was a catchy but run-of-the mill piece of pop music .
it was the singer , not the song , that made the difference : lena 's performance got people to take a closer listen .
breaking the rules over the years , the eurovision song contest has created a parallel universe of kitsch and pomp .
the world 's biggest tv event , it features over-the-top performances , tacky costumes and songs that might be unbearable to anyone who lacks a secret fondness for bad music .
lena 's decision to opt out of the gaudy spectacle was a wise one - but it would only work for someone with her special charm .
where others relied on pyrotechnics and led outfits , lena took the stage as lena , pure and simple .
since february , she 's weathered the media circus , completed her school-leaving exams and recorded her first album , but lena still comes through as authentic - and anything but routine .
with a deliberate non-marketing strategy , she won over germany - and then the rest of europe .
a little lena in everyone little is known about lena 's personal life , and the singer is kept away from tabloid media - and that 's what makes her so relatable .
she 's confident , young , cheeky - a bit zany - but ambitious : who would n't want to be the very same way ?
we 've had enough of empty promises , media fabrications and artificial emotions .
let 's just enjoy the moment and be glad the lena phenomenon has bridged a generation gap , challenged the superstar top-model mold - and of course , that because of her , germany will have the honor of hosting next year 's eurovision song contest .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.05.2010 icc members get to grips with wars of aggression großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symbol of international criminal court justice the conference to review the work and jurisdiction of the international criminal court got underway on monday with the issue of state aggression topping the agenda . when the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- opened for business in the hague back in 2002 , the message was clear : it was the beginning of the end of impunity for the perpetrators of war crimes , genocide and other crimes against humanity . so far , the icc has begun investigations into situations in five countries , all of them african .
and that has led to cries of imbalance from countries in the african union .
but president of the chamber of preliminary proceedings in the hague , german judge hans peter kaul says there is nothing unfair about the cases the court has chosen to pursue .
“ there are very simple reasons why crimes in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo and in the central african republic are being investigated . ”
in the three examples kaul cites , the governments themselves referred them to the icc because they recognised a need for help in processing crimes committed on their turf .
cautious optimism nonetheless , the process of pinpointing individual perpetrators is difficult , not least because it is simultaneously a judgement on the misconduct of the relevant nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc issued an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir which is why some states feel an extended jurisdiction of the court could encroach on their sovereignty .
not least when the proposed extension relates to the contentious issue of crimes of aggression .
while the icc officially has jurisdiction over state aggression , the 111 member states have never formally agreed on the definition of the crime .
it is hoped they will do so during the kampala conference .
speaking ahead of the meeting , president of the icc 's assembly of state parties , christian wenaweser said he was " cautiously optimistic " that member states could reach a deal on the controversial issue .
he said it would be " a significant step forward in the development of international law and an important extension of the court 's jurisdiction . "
definitive definition informally delegates have agreed that only state and army leaders could be indicted and only if the war of aggression were in breach of the un charter .
but the real challenge is to determine who has the power to decide whether a war is just and initiate an investigation accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council france , england and the us say the job should fall to the un security council .
but as wenaweser explains , not everyone wants the same thing .
" some countries view it as an exclusive security council right , " he said .
" but others say it would lead to the politicisation of the icc . " in the case of the former , the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , china , france and england could stop the icc from indicting their own citizens or their allies by using their power of veto .
until now germany has been opposed to such a role for the security council .
but there are others in kampala who are for it , so for the time being it 's a case of wait and see .

i would like to take a change and answer your question of the week .
i think at the moment europe should prevent such countries as poland , hungary and romania from joining the single currency .
these countries are not well-developed and have plenty of economic problems , and with the current crisis , it will weaken the euro even further .
i think it would be wise to wait for the economic situation in europe in general and in these countries in particular to improve .

the documentary won its first prize shortly after it arrived in movie theatres in the fall of 2009 .
the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .
it was a newspaper clip that got me interested , ” says boote .
“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
it ’ s a chemical substance from the production of plastics that people suspect causes allergies and influences the hormonal system . ”
this was a defining moment for boote , who then decided to look more intensively at how plastics can threaten our health and the environment .
the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .
the reaction from the plastics industry also shows that it is time to take boote seriously .
for 18 months , “ plasticseurope ” didn ’ t respond to any of his phone calls .
but the premiere of the film was important enough for them to create five-page dossier : suggestions on how to respond and react to the film .
boote uses shocking scenes in his documentary and delivers many facts .
for example , that 40 years ago , five million tons of plastic were produced in europe .
today it is 60 million tons – one-fourth of the total world production .
at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , the austrian filmmaker wants to use constructive criticism : “ we have to ask ourselves : what do i really need ?
how can i contribute ?
at some point you will realize that it ’ s cool to think about consumption . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .

the documentary won its first prize shortly after it arrived in movie theatres in the fall of 2009 .
the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .
it was a newspaper clip that got me interested , ” says boote .
“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
it ’ s a chemical substance from the production of plastics that people suspect causes allergies and influences the hormonal system . ”
this was a defining moment for boote , who then decided to look more intensively at how plastics can threaten our health and the environment .
the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .
the reaction from the plastics industry also shows that it is time to take boote seriously .
for 18 months , “ plasticseurope ” didn ’ t respond to any of his phone calls .
but the premiere of the film was important enough for them to create five-page dossier : suggestions on how to respond and react to the film .
boote uses shocking scenes in his documentary and delivers many facts .
for example , that 40 years ago , five million tons of plastic were produced in europe .
today it is 60 million tons – one-fourth of the total world production .
at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , the austrian filmmaker wants to use constructive criticism : “ we have to ask ourselves : what do i really need ?
how can i contribute ?
at some point you will realize that it ’ s cool to think about consumption . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .
" at first glance it does not look like this basic rule was adhered to . "
germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle said he was " deeply concerned about the events last night in the waters off gaza ... these are disconcerting initial reports . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said " nothing can justify " the violence .
ambassadors from the 27 eu member nations were to hold an emergency meeting monday afternoon to discuss the incident .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt on monday said it was important to " quickly establish " what happened on the boats .
he said he had summoned the israeli ambassador to get more information .
he said that he had been in touch with ashton , and that the eu must give " a clear response during the day when we get a clearer picture of what has happened . "
authorities in spain and greece have also summoned the israeli ambassadors in their countries for information .
greek government officials announced that they would withdraw from planned joint military exercises with israel in protest .
turkish outrage turkey 's foreign ministry warned of " irreparable consequences " after the incident and announced at midday that they would be recalling their ambassador to israel .
some of the ships were sailing under turkish flags and media reports indicate that turkish nationals are among the dead .
" by targeting civilians , israel has once again shown its disregard for human life and peaceful initiatives .
we strongly condemn these inhumane practices of israel , " the turkish foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this deplorable incident , which took place in open sees and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law , may lead to irreparable consequences in our bilateral relations . "
bildunterschrift : many of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to israeli hospitals turkey has long been an important ally of israel , one of only a few in the muslim world .
but relations have declined since israel 's attack on gaza a year and a half ago , in which some 1,400 palestinians died and of which turkey was very critical .
on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .
in another demonstration , a crowd of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the residence of israeli ambassador gabby levy in ankara shouting " damn israel " and reciting prayers .
dozens of police were on duty in front of the building .
deadly clashes the six-boat flotilla was organized by several groups , including a turkish human rights organization , and was said to be carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid , as well as pro-palestinian activists .
the ships were in international waters 124 kilometers off the coast of israel when they were intercepted by the israeli navy and boarded by commandos .
demonstrators on the ships clashed with the soldiers .
the israeli army said the demonstrators were armed with knives and clubs and that commandos opened fire after one person on the boat grabbed a weapon from a commando .
the death toll from the incident is unclear , but the israeli military said more than ten activists had been killed and dozens of activists and soldiers were injured .
israeli trade minister binyamin ben-eliezer voiced " regret at all the fatalities , " but added that soldiers had been " set upon with batons and tools , " which forced them to defend themselves .
hamas , the islamist group which controls the gaza strip , issued a call for an " uprising " of muslims and arabs across the world .
israel has imposed a blockade on gaza since 2007 , hoping to prevent weapons and bombmaking supplies from getting into the hands of militants .
but opponents of the measure and some nongovernmental organizations say the blockade has also prevented needed medical supplies and food from getting to the area , a claim israel has denied. svs / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .

on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .

israeli trade minister binyamin ben-eliezer voiced " regret at all the fatalities , " but added that soldiers had been " set upon with batons and tools , " which forced them to defend themselves .
hamas , the islamist group which controls the gaza strip , issued a call for an " uprising " of muslims and arabs across the world .
israel has imposed a blockade on gaza since 2007 , hoping to prevent weapons and bombmaking supplies from getting into the hands of militants .
but opponents of the measure and some nongovernmental organizations say the blockade has also prevented needed medical supplies and food from getting to the area , a claim israel has denied. svs / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .
coordinating cooperation second , the eeas should be part of a coordinated intra-eu development cooperation structure .
the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .
replacing ring-fences with safeguards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official development aid from europe increased in 2009 , despite the financial crisis the european commission is the appropriate body to ensure that development is safeguarded as its responsibilities for managing oda are enshrined in the eu treaties .
dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .
development power europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- is a leading european thinktank the lisbon treaty marks a milestone in the emergence of the eu as an international actor .
the blueprint for achieving a greater global role is not to try to ” speak with one voice ” on every issue , but to focus on the eu 's strengths in policy areas where it can make a difference .
as a development actor the eu has huge resources and more reach than individual member states .
the eu is also better at repetitive legalese than at mobilising hard power .
this does not capture headlines but is essential for pursuing global development objectives .
the full implications of the lisbon treaty are not yet clear , but the trend towards integration in eu external relations , development and foreign policy is real , and development will have an increasingly important role .
many of europe 's foreign policy and security interests are also development issues : state fragility and illegal migration are just two examples .
those tasked with designing the eu 's external relations architecture have a unique opportunity to serve global development and european foreign policy goals simultaneously .
clearer institutional safeguards for eu development policy would make an important contribution on both fronts .

the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .

dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .

the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .

that is a problem for greece as the tourism sector is the country 's biggest source of foreign currency .
about 30,000 room reservations were cancelled in athens in may alone after protesters set fire to a bank , killing three people , according to the country 's hotel association pox .
deutsche welle talked to greek tourism minister georgios nikitiadis about the country 's debt crisis and the impact it has had on the tourism industry .
dw : why should a tourist visit greece , especially this year ?
is there something special that greece offers ?
nikitiadis : there are three or four very , very important reasons why a person should visit greece : one is that greece is one of the most beautiful countries in the world : nice beaches , nice sand .
everywhere you go in greece you face beauty .
the second reason : very , very few countries in the world offer a civilization like the one we offer .
the third basic reason is that our prices have fallen by more that 20 percent , becoming more competitive than at any other time .
people are scared to travel to greece after the violence especially with their families .
many people are afraid – because of the strikes for example - visiting greece could turn into an odyssey .
that 's far away from the reality , because greece has no more strikes than other countries in europe .
greek airlines and airlines operating in greece do not go on strike more than any other country .
and a couple of days ago we had an airline strike .
do n't forget the word " philoxenia " .
it 's a greek word .
it means " friend of the stranger , friend of somebody who comes from abroad " .
so i think there should n't be any concern at all .
greece is a very safe , a very secure place : at least just as secure as any other large european country .
a lot of germans are scared to visit greece because of worsening german-greek relations .
we love the german people , as we always did .
they are more than welcome .
we never had anything against the german people whatsoever .
i understand that there has been a lot of media coverage about german-greek relations reported in a number of publications .
but we know that the german people love us .
there is nothing that can come between us . "

dw : why should a tourist visit greece , especially this year ?
is there something special that greece offers ?
nikitiadis : there are three or four very , very important reasons why a person should visit greece : one is that greece is one of the most beautiful countries in the world : nice beaches , nice sand .
everywhere you go in greece you face beauty .
the second reason : very , very few countries in the world offer a civilization like the one we offer .
the third basic reason is that our prices have fallen by more that 20 percent , becoming more competitive than at any other time .
people are scared to travel to greece after the violence especially with their families .
many people are afraid – because of the strikes for example - visiting greece could turn into an odyssey .
that 's far away from the reality , because greece has no more strikes than other countries in europe .
greek airlines and airlines operating in greece do not go on strike more than any other country .
and a couple of days ago we had an airline strike .
do n't forget the word " philoxenia " .
it 's a greek word .
it means " friend of the stranger , friend of somebody who comes from abroad " .
so i think there should n't be any concern at all .
greece is a very safe , a very secure place : at least just as secure as any other large european country .
a lot of germans are scared to visit greece because of worsening german-greek relations .
we love the german people , as we always did .
they are more than welcome .
we never had anything against the german people whatsoever .
i understand that there has been a lot of media coverage about german-greek relations reported in a number of publications .
but we know that the german people love us .
there is nothing that can come between us . "

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .

in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 31.05.2010 un climate talks resume but no deal on the horizon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unfcc want to get climate talks back on track un climate talks resume in bonn on monday with the difficult task of preparing for a december climate meeting in mexico .
but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "

eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2010 who takes aim at tobacco ads targeting women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young and female : a key target group for tobacco firms the tobacco industry is trying to convert more women to smoking , says the world health organization .
on this year 's world no tobacco day , the group has created a counter-campaign to combat the trend . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has put cigarette advertising aimed at women at the center of its annual world no tobacco day .
the organization says the tobacco industry is unscrupulous in its attempts to market cigarettes to young women in general , especially in the developing world .
douglas bettcher , the director of the who 's tobacco free initiative , told deutsche welle that the prevalence of deadly diseases among smokers , such as cancer , emphysema , and heart disease , means the tobacco industry is " always looking for new populations , such as young women , to light up and support their profit motives . "
and the group 's web site claims that " women are the main targets of the tobacco industry 's efforts to win new consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakarta , indonesia was blasted for its laissez-faire smoking rules there is certainly more room for growth in the market for female smokers , statistics show .
across the world , just 9 percent of women and 40 percent of men currently smoke .
meanwhile , a who study of 151 countries shows 7 percent of adolescent girls smoke , compared with 12 percent of adolescent boys .
female smokers are catching up to male smokers , according to statistics .
in several countries - including , in europe , bulgaria , croatia , and the czech republic - the number of female tobacco users outweighs the male users , the who study showed .
counter-campaign trades beauty for illness the trend is worrisome , who says .
its new report entitled " women and health : today 's evidence , tomorrow 's agenda , " cites evidence that tobacco advertising increasingly targets girls .
thus for this year 's world no tobacco day , the health agency decided to highlight the tobacco industry 's tactics of associating tobacco use with beauty and freedom in its advertising .
one part of this year 's campaign was creating a series of hard-hitting posters that show attractive , but extremely ill , smokers , such as a model with mouth cancer or a tracheotomy tube .
" this campaign calls attention to the tobacco industry 's attempts to market its deadly products by associating tobacco use with beauty and liberation , " who assistant director-general for noncommunicable diseases and mental health , ala alwan , said .
cigarette marketing has become especially unscrupulous in parts of africa and asia , said adepju olukoya , who works on gender and health issues for who .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking women were often considered sophisticated " the industry has studied what makes women tick in both developed and developing countries .
in many developing countries especially , the young people want to be part of the global advance of fashion , in music , in being ' with it ' , " she told deutsche welle .
" so the tobacco industry uses this effectively by promoting sports events and concert events that draw young people - both male and female , " she added . sobering statistics challenging the millions of dollars spent on cigarette marketing wo n't be easy , but the who is trying .
even though it is unlikely that its posters will be seen by as many young women as see the cigarette advertisements , the organization hopes they will deter at least some women from lighting up .
" the world no tobacco day -lrb- poster -rrb- campaign seeks to turn the tables on the tobacco industry , showing tobacco use in its true light , " who 's bettcher said .
" no one should be fooled ...
tobacco is not stylish .
it is deadly and addictive . "
tobacco use kills more than five million people every year , about 1.5 million of whom are women , who says .
about half of long-term smokers die from tobacco related illness , the group says .
in general , statistics show women are more vulnerable to tobacco-related illnesses , according to germany 's federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- .
the group says second-hand smoke is a particular threat to women , especially pregnant women and their babies .
according to bzga , 26 percent of german women and 34 percent of german men are smokers .
long history of women and tobacco the who 's poster campaign is just the latest salvo in a long fight between health agencies and the tobacco industry over the targeting of women and girls .
in the 1920s , lucky strike cigarettes first linked smoking to weight control by urging women to " reach for a lucky instead of a sweet . "
in the 1960s , philip morris introduced virginia slims , the first cigarette brand created specifically for women and targeted to that consumer group .
and in the 1970s , tobacco companies targeted women with ads implying that " light " and " low tar " cigarettes were safer for consumption - despite knowing this was not the case , the us anti-smoking advocacy group tobacco free kids says .

since then it has opened investigations into five situations in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo , the central african republic , darfur and kenya , and has issued arrest warrants for thirteen people .
four of them are in custody , two have died and the rest remain at large .
ahead of the kampala review conference , the court 's chief prosecutor argentinean lawyer luis moreno ocampo , said the world had moved a couple of steps closer to ending impunity for grave crimes , but that there is still plenty to be done .
" basically we are working on cases in congo , uganda , central african republic , darfur and now we are requesting the judges to start an investigation into kenya . "
ocampo said , adding that the court is also currently assessing situations in colombia , ivory coast , afghanistan , palestine and georgia .
us still holding back in the 12 years since the rome statute was first adopted , 111 of the 192 united nations states have become members of the icc .
a further 39 have signed but not yet ratified the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama is sending observers to the review conference among those that have resisted the court altogether are sudan , iraq , iran , israel , cuba and saudia arabia .
and of course , the us .
washington has long refused to become a signatory and back in its day , the bush administration went so far as to pressure other countries to follow its lead .
benjamin ferencz , a former nazi war crimes investigator and chief prosecutor at the nuremberg trials in 1946 is fiercely critical of the us stance towards the court .
" if any country violates the law they should be tried , whether they be the united states or israel or china or anybody else , " ferencz said .
" that is what law means , you lay down the law and those who violate it are held accountable . "
good for the us , good for the world while the obama administration has not continued with the sabotage campaign of the bush era , the new president has not gone the extra mile and agreed to join .
on the contrary , he remains opposed to the icc on the grounds that to join could be to subject its soldiers to arbitrary indictments and arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in afghanistan but david scheffer , who participated in the original rome statute negotiations , rejects obama 's reasoning out of hand .
he says the us military stands to benefit from a process that helps to make other countries comply with the laws of war .
" an international criminal court is fundamental force protection for the united states military , " scheffer said .
at the kampala conference , delegates will be looking at how effective the court can really be in helping to resolve domestic conflicts and how it can best contribute to the prevention of future crimes . in that vein , last year ocampo issued an international arrest warrant against sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
but many arab and african governments have continued their relations with him regardless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon even the united nations secretary general ban ki moon sent its top two officials in sudan to attend bashir 's swearing-in ceremony last week following his re-election to a second term in office .
the move was considered controversial among many un countries and a sign that in the case of sudan at least , the icc does not have the power it might like .

since then it has opened investigations into five situations in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo , the central african republic , darfur and kenya , and has issued arrest warrants for thirteen people .
four of them are in custody , two have died and the rest remain at large .
ahead of the kampala review conference , the court 's chief prosecutor argentinean lawyer luis moreno ocampo , said the world had moved a couple of steps closer to ending impunity for grave crimes , but that there is still plenty to be done .
" basically we are working on cases in congo , uganda , central african republic , darfur and now we are requesting the judges to start an investigation into kenya . "
ocampo said , adding that the court is also currently assessing situations in colombia , ivory coast , afghanistan , palestine and georgia .
us still holding back in the 12 years since the rome statute was first adopted , 111 of the 192 united nations states have become members of the icc .
a further 39 have signed but not yet ratified the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama is sending observers to the review conference among those that have resisted the court altogether are sudan , iraq , iran , israel , cuba and saudia arabia .
and of course , the us .
washington has long refused to become a signatory and back in its day , the bush administration went so far as to pressure other countries to follow its lead .
benjamin ferencz , a former nazi war crimes investigator and chief prosecutor at the nuremberg trials in 1946 is fiercely critical of the us stance towards the court .
" if any country violates the law they should be tried , whether they be the united states or israel or china or anybody else , " ferencz said .
" that is what law means , you lay down the law and those who violate it are held accountable . "
good for the us , good for the world while the obama administration has not continued with the sabotage campaign of the bush era , the new president has not gone the extra mile and agreed to join .
on the contrary , he remains opposed to the icc on the grounds that to join could be to subject its soldiers to arbitrary indictments and arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in afghanistan but david scheffer , who participated in the original rome statute negotiations , rejects obama 's reasoning out of hand .
he says the us military stands to benefit from a process that helps to make other countries comply with the laws of war .
" an international criminal court is fundamental force protection for the united states military , " scheffer said .
at the kampala conference , delegates will be looking at how effective the court can really be in helping to resolve domestic conflicts and how it can best contribute to the prevention of future crimes . in that vein , last year ocampo issued an international arrest warrant against sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
but many arab and african governments have continued their relations with him regardless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon even the united nations secretary general ban ki moon sent its top two officials in sudan to attend bashir 's swearing-in ceremony last week following his re-election to a second term in office .
the move was considered controversial among many un countries and a sign that in the case of sudan at least , the icc does not have the power it might like .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .
a new president will need to be sworn in by june 30. gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .
a new president will need to be sworn in by june 30. gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.05.2010 icc members get to grips with wars of aggression großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symbol of international criminal court justice the conference to review the work and jurisdiction of the international criminal court got underway on monday with the issue of state aggression topping the agenda . when the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- opened for business in the hague back in 2002 , the message was clear : it was the beginning of the end of impunity for the perpetrators of war crimes , genocide and other crimes against humanity . so far , the icc has begun investigations into situations in five countries , all of them african .
and that has led to cries of imbalance from countries in the african union .
but president of the chamber of preliminary proceedings in the hague , german judge hans peter kaul says there is nothing unfair about the cases the court has chosen to pursue .
“ there are very simple reasons why crimes in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo and in the central african republic are being investigated . ”
in the three examples kaul cites , the governments themselves referred them to the icc because they recognised a need for help in processing crimes committed on their turf .
cautious optimism nonetheless , the process of pinpointing individual perpetrators is difficult , not least because it is simultaneously a judgement on the misconduct of the relevant nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc issued an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir which is why some states feel an extended jurisdiction of the court could encroach on their sovereignty .
not least when the proposed extension relates to the contentious issue of crimes of aggression .
while the icc officially has jurisdiction over state aggression , the 111 member states have never formally agreed on the definition of the crime .
it is hoped they will do so during the kampala conference .
speaking ahead of the meeting , president of the icc 's assembly of state parties , christian wenaweser said he was " cautiously optimistic " that member states could reach a deal on the controversial issue .
he said it would be " a significant step forward in the development of international law and an important extension of the court 's jurisdiction . "
definitive definition informally delegates have agreed that only state and army leaders could be indicted and only if the war of aggression were in breach of the un charter .
but the real challenge is to determine who has the power to decide whether a war is just and initiate an investigation accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council france , england and the us say the job should fall to the un security council .
but as wenaweser explains , not everyone wants the same thing .
" some countries view it as an exclusive security council right , " he said .
" but others say it would lead to the politicisation of the icc . " in the case of the former , the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , china , france and england could stop the icc from indicting their own citizens or their allies by using their power of veto .
until now germany has been opposed to such a role for the security council .
but there are others in kampala who are for it , so for the time being it 's a case of wait and see .

and that has led to cries of imbalance from countries in the african union .
but president of the chamber of preliminary proceedings in the hague , german judge hans peter kaul says there is nothing unfair about the cases the court has chosen to pursue .
“ there are very simple reasons why crimes in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo and in the central african republic are being investigated . ”
in the three examples kaul cites , the governments themselves referred them to the icc because they recognised a need for help in processing crimes committed on their turf .
cautious optimism nonetheless , the process of pinpointing individual perpetrators is difficult , not least because it is simultaneously a judgement on the misconduct of the relevant nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc issued an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir which is why some states feel an extended jurisdiction of the court could encroach on their sovereignty .
not least when the proposed extension relates to the contentious issue of crimes of aggression .
while the icc officially has jurisdiction over state aggression , the 111 member states have never formally agreed on the definition of the crime .
it is hoped they will do so during the kampala conference .
speaking ahead of the meeting , president of the icc 's assembly of state parties , christian wenaweser said he was " cautiously optimistic " that member states could reach a deal on the controversial issue .
he said it would be " a significant step forward in the development of international law and an important extension of the court 's jurisdiction . "
definitive definition informally delegates have agreed that only state and army leaders could be indicted and only if the war of aggression were in breach of the un charter .
but the real challenge is to determine who has the power to decide whether a war is just and initiate an investigation accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council france , england and the us say the job should fall to the un security council .
but as wenaweser explains , not everyone wants the same thing .
" some countries view it as an exclusive security council right , " he said .
" but others say it would lead to the politicisation of the icc . " in the case of the former , the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , china , france and england could stop the icc from indicting their own citizens or their allies by using their power of veto .
until now germany has been opposed to such a role for the security council .
but there are others in kampala who are for it , so for the time being it 's a case of wait and see .

most germans know that the country is divided ; they might even know what kimchi and taekwondo are but it does not usually go much further .
some young germans want to know more . what pushes a german to study korean ?
there are all kinds of reasons , says daniel lindemann , who is 24 . he studies korean at bonn university .
he has been interested in korea ever since his 16th birthday . " my uncle gave me an illustrated book about korea .
there were lots of great photos and explanations about the culture .
it awakened my interest . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel lindemann studies korean at bonn university " korean is not that hard " daniel lindemann has one more semester to go .
he says that korean has not been that difficult for him and says " you can start having and understanding conversations within a relatively short amount of time .
i do n't think it 's particularly hard – it 's a foreign language just like any other .
in any case , it can be learnt . " korean pop culture is very popular in other asian countries , especially the television series and the many boy and girl bands . one of daniel 's favorite shows is the historical television drama " chuno " , which means slave hunt and is about a time when slavery was part of korean life .
he watched it on the internet last year and says that " interest has grown among the young generation .
not all over society yet but it is increasing . " " discovering different aspects of korea is fun " jan janowski is 25 .
he did korean studies at the free university in berlin and for two years he has been in seoul , where he studies political science at korea university .
he explains that he had a friend who was korean at school – he liked the sound of the language with the different tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan janowski studied korean in berlin before moving to seoul although he was not sure whether he should study korean at university , he decided to throw himself in at the deep end .
he has never regretted his decision and thinks that " what 's interesting about korea is simply that there are so many aspects .
especially because we do not know that much about korea and therefore it is fun to make these big discoveries for ourselves . " but jan adds that it is important to have an adventurous spirit to really get into korean studies . plenty of job opportunities after university , many german students of korean continue their research or find jobs with korean businesses based in germany .
however , jan janowski says there are far more opportunities for these germans in korea itself . apart from studying , he also works for the korean tourism organisation , the kto , and often does translation work .
he says there are many germans who are doing well in seoul thanks to their korean studies degrees . he cautions that it makes little sense to go to korea unless one is really interested in the language and culture . author : bumsuk lee editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .
a new president will need to be sworn in by june 30. gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer politics -pipe- 31.05.2010 former german president koehler leaves mostly positive legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler was first elected in 2004 in a surprise announcement , german president horst koehler has resigned from his post .
although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .

anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .

a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .

and that has led to cries of imbalance from countries in the african union .
but president of the chamber of preliminary proceedings in the hague , german judge hans peter kaul says there is nothing unfair about the cases the court has chosen to pursue .
“ there are very simple reasons why crimes in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo and in the central african republic are being investigated . ”
in the three examples kaul cites , the governments themselves referred them to the icc because they recognised a need for help in processing crimes committed on their turf .
cautious optimism nonetheless , the process of pinpointing individual perpetrators is difficult , not least because it is simultaneously a judgement on the misconduct of the relevant nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc issued an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir which is why some states feel an extended jurisdiction of the court could encroach on their sovereignty .
not least when the proposed extension relates to the contentious issue of crimes of aggression .
while the icc officially has jurisdiction over state aggression , the 111 member states have never formally agreed on the definition of the crime .
it is hoped they will do so during the kampala conference .
speaking ahead of the meeting , president of the icc 's assembly of state parties , christian wenaweser said he was " cautiously optimistic " that member states could reach a deal on the controversial issue .
he said it would be " a significant step forward in the development of international law and an important extension of the court 's jurisdiction . "
definitive definition informally delegates have agreed that only state and army leaders could be indicted and only if the war of aggression were in breach of the un charter .
but the real challenge is to determine who has the power to decide whether a war is just and initiate an investigation accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council france , england and the us say the job should fall to the un security council .
but as wenaweser explains , not everyone wants the same thing .
" some countries view it as an exclusive security council right , " he said .
" but others say it would lead to the politicisation of the icc . " in the case of the former , the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , china , france and england could stop the icc from indicting their own citizens or their allies by using their power of veto .
until now germany has been opposed to such a role for the security council .
but there are others in kampala who are for it , so for the time being it 's a case of wait and see .

and that has led to cries of imbalance from countries in the african union .
but president of the chamber of preliminary proceedings in the hague , german judge hans peter kaul says there is nothing unfair about the cases the court has chosen to pursue .
“ there are very simple reasons why crimes in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo and in the central african republic are being investigated . ”
in the three examples kaul cites , the governments themselves referred them to the icc because they recognised a need for help in processing crimes committed on their turf .
cautious optimism nonetheless , the process of pinpointing individual perpetrators is difficult , not least because it is simultaneously a judgement on the misconduct of the relevant nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc issued an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir which is why some states feel an extended jurisdiction of the court could encroach on their sovereignty .
not least when the proposed extension relates to the contentious issue of crimes of aggression .
while the icc officially has jurisdiction over state aggression , the 111 member states have never formally agreed on the definition of the crime .
it is hoped they will do so during the kampala conference .

since then it has opened investigations into five situations in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo , the central african republic , darfur and kenya , and has issued arrest warrants for thirteen people .
four of them are in custody , two have died and the rest remain at large .
ahead of the kampala review conference , the court 's chief prosecutor argentinean lawyer luis moreno ocampo , said the world had moved a couple of steps closer to ending impunity for grave crimes , but that there is still plenty to be done .
" basically we are working on cases in congo , uganda , central african republic , darfur and now we are requesting the judges to start an investigation into kenya . "
ocampo said , adding that the court is also currently assessing situations in colombia , ivory coast , afghanistan , palestine and georgia .
us still holding back in the 12 years since the rome statute was first adopted , 111 of the 192 united nations states have become members of the icc .
a further 39 have signed but not yet ratified the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama is sending observers to the review conference among those that have resisted the court altogether are sudan , iraq , iran , israel , cuba and saudia arabia .
and of course , the us .
washington has long refused to become a signatory and back in its day , the bush administration went so far as to pressure other countries to follow its lead .
benjamin ferencz , a former nazi war crimes investigator and chief prosecutor at the nuremberg trials in 1946 is fiercely critical of the us stance towards the court .
" if any country violates the law they should be tried , whether they be the united states or israel or china or anybody else , " ferencz said .
" that is what law means , you lay down the law and those who violate it are held accountable . "
good for the us , good for the world while the obama administration has not continued with the sabotage campaign of the bush era , the new president has not gone the extra mile and agreed to join .
on the contrary , he remains opposed to the icc on the grounds that to join could be to subject its soldiers to arbitrary indictments and arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in afghanistan but david scheffer , who participated in the original rome statute negotiations , rejects obama 's reasoning out of hand .
he says the us military stands to benefit from a process that helps to make other countries comply with the laws of war .
" an international criminal court is fundamental force protection for the united states military , " scheffer said .
at the kampala conference , delegates will be looking at how effective the court can really be in helping to resolve domestic conflicts and how it can best contribute to the prevention of future crimes . in that vein , last year ocampo issued an international arrest warrant against sudan 's president omar al-bashir .

but the country 's constitution has clear guidelines on what happens next - and a power vacuum is not in sight . president horst koehler 's resignation is an unheard-of event in germany , but it will not result in a power vacuum .
according to the constitution , the head of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany 's federal states , takes over at this point .
every year , one of the 16 state premiers takes on the position of bundesrat president .
the present incumbent is jens boehrnsen , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- mayor of bremen .
boehrnsen will take over all of the federal president 's duties until an electoral college , the federal convention , elects a successor for koehler .
the federal convention must convene within 30 days - in this case , by june 30 . the federal convention is germany 's largest parliamentary body , and is solely responsible for the selection of the federal president .
all of the members of the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , are entitled to vote , as well as a corresponding number of representatives from the federal states .
the convention last met a year ago , in may 2009 , to re-elect koehler . then , it numbered 1,224 delegates .
germany could be in for a difficult vote the federal president is elected by secret ballot , without a prior debate , and requires an absolute majority .
should none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round , then the candidate who receives a simple majority in a third round of voting is considered elected as president .
germany 's head of state is not elected by the people .
as a rule , the political parties suggest candidates , not necessarily someone from within their ranks but a respected public figure capable of representing germany across party boundaries .
horst koehler , for instance , was supported by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the current ruling coalition in berlin .
this presidential election promises to be interesting because of the unclear situation in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which dispatches the greatest number of delegates to the federal convention .
the newly-elected parliament in duesseldorf does not have a governing majority yet , as coalition talks are still underway .
the result of these talks could have an effect on which way the nrw delegates votes . as a rule , federal convention delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice , but generally , they do adhere to their respective parties ' recommendations . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- db -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer is to stand down after the bonn talks poor countries set new demands developing countries , meanwhile , have raised new demands and pressed developed countries to take greater responsibility for climate change .
in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's constitution has clear guidelines on what happens next - and a power vacuum is not in sight . president horst koehler 's resignation is an unheard-of event in germany , but it will not result in a power vacuum .
according to the constitution , the head of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany 's federal states , takes over at this point .
every year , one of the 16 state premiers takes on the position of bundesrat president .
the present incumbent is jens boehrnsen , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- mayor of bremen .
boehrnsen will take over all of the federal president 's duties until an electoral college , the federal convention , elects a successor for koehler .
the federal convention must convene within 30 days - in this case , by june 30 . the federal convention is germany 's largest parliamentary body , and is solely responsible for the selection of the federal president .
all of the members of the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , are entitled to vote , as well as a corresponding number of representatives from the federal states .
the convention last met a year ago , in may 2009 , to re-elect koehler . then , it numbered 1,224 delegates .
germany could be in for a difficult vote the federal president is elected by secret ballot , without a prior debate , and requires an absolute majority .
should none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round , then the candidate who receives a simple majority in a third round of voting is considered elected as president .
germany 's head of state is not elected by the people .
as a rule , the political parties suggest candidates , not necessarily someone from within their ranks but a respected public figure capable of representing germany across party boundaries .
horst koehler , for instance , was supported by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the current ruling coalition in berlin .
this presidential election promises to be interesting because of the unclear situation in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which dispatches the greatest number of delegates to the federal convention .
the newly-elected parliament in duesseldorf does not have a governing majority yet , as coalition talks are still underway .
the result of these talks could have an effect on which way the nrw delegates votes . as a rule , federal convention delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice , but generally , they do adhere to their respective parties ' recommendations . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- db -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then it has opened investigations into five situations in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo , the central african republic , darfur and kenya , and has issued arrest warrants for thirteen people .
four of them are in custody , two have died and the rest remain at large .
ahead of the kampala review conference , the court 's chief prosecutor argentinean lawyer luis moreno ocampo , said the world had moved a couple of steps closer to ending impunity for grave crimes , but that there is still plenty to be done .
" basically we are working on cases in congo , uganda , central african republic , darfur and now we are requesting the judges to start an investigation into kenya . "
ocampo said , adding that the court is also currently assessing situations in colombia , ivory coast , afghanistan , palestine and georgia .

washington has long refused to become a signatory and back in its day , the bush administration went so far as to pressure other countries to follow its lead .
benjamin ferencz , a former nazi war crimes investigator and chief prosecutor at the nuremberg trials in 1946 is fiercely critical of the us stance towards the court .
" if any country violates the law they should be tried , whether they be the united states or israel or china or anybody else , " ferencz said .
" that is what law means , you lay down the law and those who violate it are held accountable . "
good for the us , good for the world while the obama administration has not continued with the sabotage campaign of the bush era , the new president has not gone the extra mile and agreed to join .
on the contrary , he remains opposed to the icc on the grounds that to join could be to subject its soldiers to arbitrary indictments and arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in afghanistan but david scheffer , who participated in the original rome statute negotiations , rejects obama 's reasoning out of hand .
he says the us military stands to benefit from a process that helps to make other countries comply with the laws of war .
" an international criminal court is fundamental force protection for the united states military , " scheffer said .
at the kampala conference , delegates will be looking at how effective the court can really be in helping to resolve domestic conflicts and how it can best contribute to the prevention of future crimes . in that vein , last year ocampo issued an international arrest warrant against sudan 's president omar al-bashir .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .
a new president will need to be sworn in by june 30. gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then it has opened investigations into five situations in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo , the central african republic , darfur and kenya , and has issued arrest warrants for thirteen people .
four of them are in custody , two have died and the rest remain at large .
ahead of the kampala review conference , the court 's chief prosecutor argentinean lawyer luis moreno ocampo , said the world had moved a couple of steps closer to ending impunity for grave crimes , but that there is still plenty to be done .
" basically we are working on cases in congo , uganda , central african republic , darfur and now we are requesting the judges to start an investigation into kenya . "
ocampo said , adding that the court is also currently assessing situations in colombia , ivory coast , afghanistan , palestine and georgia .
us still holding back in the 12 years since the rome statute was first adopted , 111 of the 192 united nations states have become members of the icc .
a further 39 have signed but not yet ratified the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama is sending observers to the review conference among those that have resisted the court altogether are sudan , iraq , iran , israel , cuba and saudia arabia .
and of course , the us .
washington has long refused to become a signatory and back in its day , the bush administration went so far as to pressure other countries to follow its lead .
benjamin ferencz , a former nazi war crimes investigator and chief prosecutor at the nuremberg trials in 1946 is fiercely critical of the us stance towards the court .
" if any country violates the law they should be tried , whether they be the united states or israel or china or anybody else , " ferencz said .
" that is what law means , you lay down the law and those who violate it are held accountable . "
good for the us , good for the world while the obama administration has not continued with the sabotage campaign of the bush era , the new president has not gone the extra mile and agreed to join .
on the contrary , he remains opposed to the icc on the grounds that to join could be to subject its soldiers to arbitrary indictments and arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in afghanistan but david scheffer , who participated in the original rome statute negotiations , rejects obama 's reasoning out of hand .
he says the us military stands to benefit from a process that helps to make other countries comply with the laws of war .
" an international criminal court is fundamental force protection for the united states military , " scheffer said .
at the kampala conference , delegates will be looking at how effective the court can really be in helping to resolve domestic conflicts and how it can best contribute to the prevention of future crimes . in that vein , last year ocampo issued an international arrest warrant against sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
but many arab and african governments have continued their relations with him regardless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon even the united nations secretary general ban ki moon sent its top two officials in sudan to attend bashir 's swearing-in ceremony last week following his re-election to a second term in office .
the move was considered controversial among many un countries and a sign that in the case of sudan at least , the icc does not have the power it might like .

that is a problem for greece as the tourism sector is the country 's biggest source of foreign currency .
about 30,000 room reservations were cancelled in athens in may alone after protesters set fire to a bank , killing three people , according to the country 's hotel association pox .
deutsche welle talked to greek tourism minister georgios nikitiadis about the country 's debt crisis and the impact it has had on the tourism industry .
dw : why should a tourist visit greece , especially this year ?
is there something special that greece offers ?
nikitiadis : there are three or four very , very important reasons why a person should visit greece : one is that greece is one of the most beautiful countries in the world : nice beaches , nice sand .
everywhere you go in greece you face beauty .
the second reason : very , very few countries in the world offer a civilization like the one we offer .
the third basic reason is that our prices have fallen by more that 20 percent , becoming more competitive than at any other time .
people are scared to travel to greece after the violence especially with their families .
many people are afraid – because of the strikes for example - visiting greece could turn into an odyssey .
that 's far away from the reality , because greece has no more strikes than other countries in europe .
greek airlines and airlines operating in greece do not go on strike more than any other country .
and a couple of days ago we had an airline strike .
do n't forget the word " philoxenia " .
it 's a greek word .
it means " friend of the stranger , friend of somebody who comes from abroad " .
so i think there should n't be any concern at all .
greece is a very safe , a very secure place : at least just as secure as any other large european country .
a lot of germans are scared to visit greece because of worsening german-greek relations .
we love the german people , as we always did .
they are more than welcome .
we never had anything against the german people whatsoever .
i understand that there has been a lot of media coverage about german-greek relations reported in a number of publications .
but we know that the german people love us .
there is nothing that can come between us . "

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

but the country 's constitution has clear guidelines on what happens next - and a power vacuum is not in sight . president horst koehler 's resignation is an unheard-of event in germany , but it will not result in a power vacuum .
according to the constitution , the head of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany 's federal states , takes over at this point .
every year , one of the 16 state premiers takes on the position of bundesrat president .
the present incumbent is jens boehrnsen , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- mayor of bremen .
boehrnsen will take over all of the federal president 's duties until an electoral college , the federal convention , elects a successor for koehler .
the federal convention must convene within 30 days - in this case , by june 30 . the federal convention is germany 's largest parliamentary body , and is solely responsible for the selection of the federal president .
all of the members of the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , are entitled to vote , as well as a corresponding number of representatives from the federal states .
the convention last met a year ago , in may 2009 , to re-elect koehler . then , it numbered 1,224 delegates .
germany could be in for a difficult vote the federal president is elected by secret ballot , without a prior debate , and requires an absolute majority .
should none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round , then the candidate who receives a simple majority in a third round of voting is considered elected as president .
germany 's head of state is not elected by the people .
as a rule , the political parties suggest candidates , not necessarily someone from within their ranks but a respected public figure capable of representing germany across party boundaries .
horst koehler , for instance , was supported by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the current ruling coalition in berlin .
this presidential election promises to be interesting because of the unclear situation in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which dispatches the greatest number of delegates to the federal convention .
the newly-elected parliament in duesseldorf does not have a governing majority yet , as coalition talks are still underway .
the result of these talks could have an effect on which way the nrw delegates votes . as a rule , federal convention delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice , but generally , they do adhere to their respective parties ' recommendations . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- db -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to the current crisis there have been calls to prevent some eu members joining the single currency . and this are your answers : - name : r. mohammad himayathullah - country : india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as long as new members have their budget deficits less than 3 % of their gdp , debt ratio of less than 60 % of gdp , low inflation , and interest rates close to the eu average , eurozone should have absolutely no problem with having more members . - name : yassine el youri - country : morocco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hi , my name is yassine , from morocco .
i think it is possible to accept new members in the eurozone , if those members can make the region stronger .
in the short term there will be many problems , but in the long term , the eurozone can benefit from them. have a nice day . - name : ala maleika - country : belarus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dear made in germany team , i love your show and never miss a chance to watch it .
i would like to take a change and answer your question of the week .
i think at the moment europe should prevent such countries as poland , hungary and romania from joining the single currency .
these countries are not well-developed and have plenty of economic problems , and with the current crisis , it will weaken the euro even further .
i think it would be wise to wait for the economic situation in europe in general and in these countries in particular to improve .

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .

the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beggars have been detained as the authorities try to " clean up " the city deplorable living and working conditions the authorities have also turned a blind eye to the working conditions for thousands of workers , many of whom do not even earn the minimum wage and are forced to work in an unsafe environment .
anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .
wherever they can not remove the slums , they will put up lovely bamboo screens so that tourists and sports people do not see the unseemly sight .
the work and living conditions are terrible .
there is no safety for children .
women are turned away because they do not want children hanging around on the sites . "
delayed payment of wages rajendra kumar , a migrant labourer from rajasthan , has been working on beautifying roads for the past six months with a group from his village .
he says contractors have not been paying him on time and also paying less than the stipulated wages .
" i do n't understand this .
sometimes they say i will get paid after a week and then they postpone that .
it is tough when you do n't get money on time .
the contractors make fools of us .
there are a lot of problems but we have no choice .
we need to eat at the end of the day . "
a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .
high security during commonwealth games security for the games is another major concern .
there will be over 2,000 cctv cameras set up on roads as well as hundreds inside the competition venues to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commonwealth games mascot ' shera ' but security expert ajay sahni said the games would be safe saying that there was enough capacity and " a tremendous concentration of intelligence activity preceding the games . "
the games are expected to cost the organizers over 15 billion us dollars .
however , in view of the discomfort to many , some are wondering whether the cost of this massive facelift is really worth it and equal to the pride that hosting the commonwealth games will bring .
the commonwealth games will take place from 3 to 14 october 2010 .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .

bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .
a new president will need to be sworn in by june 30. gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu , which is russia ’ s biggest trade partner , appeared willing to make a deal before talks began in the southern city of rostov-on-don - but not without certain conditions .
brussels wants to see biometric passports for russian citizens and stronger security along russia ’ s southern borders before relaxing its visa requirements . the eu also announced before the summit that it is keen to contribute money to anti-corruption initiatives and judiciary reform in russia , although no figures were named . energy and economy energy will also dominate the agenda as talks get underway on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 31.05.2010 opinion : the european external action service 's role in eu development policymaking requires safeguards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu aid service is to increase europe 's global role guest commentator mark furness argues that clear safeguards are required to ensure that future eu development policy serves both global development and european foreign policy goals . the lisbon treaty requires that european union foreign policy does no harm to development objectives , while calling for development cooperation to be conducted within the framework of external action .
the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .
coordinating cooperation second , the eeas should be part of a coordinated intra-eu development cooperation structure .
the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .
replacing ring-fences with safeguards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official development aid from europe increased in 2009 , despite the financial crisis the european commission is the appropriate body to ensure that development is safeguarded as its responsibilities for managing oda are enshrined in the eu treaties .
dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .
development power europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- is a leading european thinktank the lisbon treaty marks a milestone in the emergence of the eu as an international actor .
the blueprint for achieving a greater global role is not to try to ” speak with one voice ” on every issue , but to focus on the eu 's strengths in policy areas where it can make a difference .
as a development actor the eu has huge resources and more reach than individual member states .
the eu is also better at repetitive legalese than at mobilising hard power .
this does not capture headlines but is essential for pursuing global development objectives .
the full implications of the lisbon treaty are not yet clear , but the trend towards integration in eu external relations , development and foreign policy is real , and development will have an increasingly important role .
many of europe 's foreign policy and security interests are also development issues : state fragility and illegal migration are just two examples .
those tasked with designing the eu 's external relations architecture have a unique opportunity to serve global development and european foreign policy goals simultaneously .
clearer institutional safeguards for eu development policy would make an important contribution on both fronts .

the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .
development power europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- is a leading european thinktank the lisbon treaty marks a milestone in the emergence of the eu as an international actor .
the blueprint for achieving a greater global role is not to try to ” speak with one voice ” on every issue , but to focus on the eu 's strengths in policy areas where it can make a difference .
as a development actor the eu has huge resources and more reach than individual member states .
the eu is also better at repetitive legalese than at mobilising hard power .
this does not capture headlines but is essential for pursuing global development objectives .
the full implications of the lisbon treaty are not yet clear , but the trend towards integration in eu external relations , development and foreign policy is real , and development will have an increasingly important role .
many of europe 's foreign policy and security interests are also development issues : state fragility and illegal migration are just two examples .
those tasked with designing the eu 's external relations architecture have a unique opportunity to serve global development and european foreign policy goals simultaneously .
clearer institutional safeguards for eu development policy would make an important contribution on both fronts .

the documentary won its first prize shortly after it arrived in movie theatres in the fall of 2009 .
the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .
it was a newspaper clip that got me interested , ” says boote .
“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
it ’ s a chemical substance from the production of plastics that people suspect causes allergies and influences the hormonal system . ”
this was a defining moment for boote , who then decided to look more intensively at how plastics can threaten our health and the environment .
the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .
the reaction from the plastics industry also shows that it is time to take boote seriously .
for 18 months , “ plasticseurope ” didn ’ t respond to any of his phone calls .
but the premiere of the film was important enough for them to create five-page dossier : suggestions on how to respond and react to the film .
boote uses shocking scenes in his documentary and delivers many facts .
for example , that 40 years ago , five million tons of plastic were produced in europe .
today it is 60 million tons – one-fourth of the total world production .
at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , the austrian filmmaker wants to use constructive criticism : “ we have to ask ourselves : what do i really need ?
how can i contribute ?
at some point you will realize that it ’ s cool to think about consumption . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .
" at first glance it does not look like this basic rule was adhered to . "
germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle said he was " deeply concerned about the events last night in the waters off gaza ... these are disconcerting initial reports . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said " nothing can justify " the violence .
ambassadors from the 27 eu member nations were to hold an emergency meeting monday afternoon to discuss the incident .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt on monday said it was important to " quickly establish " what happened on the boats .
he said he had summoned the israeli ambassador to get more information .
he said that he had been in touch with ashton , and that the eu must give " a clear response during the day when we get a clearer picture of what has happened . "
authorities in spain and greece have also summoned the israeli ambassadors in their countries for information .
greek government officials announced that they would withdraw from planned joint military exercises with israel in protest .
turkish outrage turkey 's foreign ministry warned of " irreparable consequences " after the incident and announced at midday that they would be recalling their ambassador to israel .
some of the ships were sailing under turkish flags and media reports indicate that turkish nationals are among the dead .
" by targeting civilians , israel has once again shown its disregard for human life and peaceful initiatives .
we strongly condemn these inhumane practices of israel , " the turkish foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this deplorable incident , which took place in open sees and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law , may lead to irreparable consequences in our bilateral relations . "
bildunterschrift : many of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to israeli hospitals turkey has long been an important ally of israel , one of only a few in the muslim world .
but relations have declined since israel 's attack on gaza a year and a half ago , in which some 1,400 palestinians died and of which turkey was very critical .
on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .
in another demonstration , a crowd of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the residence of israeli ambassador gabby levy in ankara shouting " damn israel " and reciting prayers .
dozens of police were on duty in front of the building .
deadly clashes the six-boat flotilla was organized by several groups , including a turkish human rights organization , and was said to be carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid , as well as pro-palestinian activists .
the ships were in international waters 124 kilometers off the coast of israel when they were intercepted by the israeli navy and boarded by commandos .
demonstrators on the ships clashed with the soldiers .
the israeli army said the demonstrators were armed with knives and clubs and that commandos opened fire after one person on the boat grabbed a weapon from a commando .
the death toll from the incident is unclear , but the israeli military said more than ten activists had been killed and dozens of activists and soldiers were injured .
israeli trade minister binyamin ben-eliezer voiced " regret at all the fatalities , " but added that soldiers had been " set upon with batons and tools , " which forced them to defend themselves .
hamas , the islamist group which controls the gaza strip , issued a call for an " uprising " of muslims and arabs across the world .
israel has imposed a blockade on gaza since 2007 , hoping to prevent weapons and bombmaking supplies from getting into the hands of militants .

deutsche welle talked to greek tourism minister georgios nikitiadis about the country 's debt crisis and the impact it has had on the tourism industry .
dw : why should a tourist visit greece , especially this year ?
is there something special that greece offers ?
nikitiadis : there are three or four very , very important reasons why a person should visit greece : one is that greece is one of the most beautiful countries in the world : nice beaches , nice sand .
everywhere you go in greece you face beauty .
the second reason : very , very few countries in the world offer a civilization like the one we offer .
the third basic reason is that our prices have fallen by more that 20 percent , becoming more competitive than at any other time .
people are scared to travel to greece after the violence especially with their families .
many people are afraid – because of the strikes for example - visiting greece could turn into an odyssey .
that 's far away from the reality , because greece has no more strikes than other countries in europe .
greek airlines and airlines operating in greece do not go on strike more than any other country .
and a couple of days ago we had an airline strike .
do n't forget the word " philoxenia " .
it 's a greek word .
it means " friend of the stranger , friend of somebody who comes from abroad " .
so i think there should n't be any concern at all .
greece is a very safe , a very secure place : at least just as secure as any other large european country .
a lot of germans are scared to visit greece because of worsening german-greek relations .
we love the german people , as we always did .
they are more than welcome .
we never had anything against the german people whatsoever .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .

in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .

in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer politics -pipe- 31.05.2010 former german president koehler leaves mostly positive legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler was first elected in 2004 in a surprise announcement , german president horst koehler has resigned from his post .
although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .
" at first glance it does not look like this basic rule was adhered to . "
germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle said he was " deeply concerned about the events last night in the waters off gaza ... these are disconcerting initial reports . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said " nothing can justify " the violence .
ambassadors from the 27 eu member nations were to hold an emergency meeting monday afternoon to discuss the incident .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt on monday said it was important to " quickly establish " what happened on the boats .
he said he had summoned the israeli ambassador to get more information .
he said that he had been in touch with ashton , and that the eu must give " a clear response during the day when we get a clearer picture of what has happened . "
authorities in spain and greece have also summoned the israeli ambassadors in their countries for information .
greek government officials announced that they would withdraw from planned joint military exercises with israel in protest .
turkish outrage turkey 's foreign ministry warned of " irreparable consequences " after the incident and announced at midday that they would be recalling their ambassador to israel .
some of the ships were sailing under turkish flags and media reports indicate that turkish nationals are among the dead .
" by targeting civilians , israel has once again shown its disregard for human life and peaceful initiatives .
we strongly condemn these inhumane practices of israel , " the turkish foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this deplorable incident , which took place in open sees and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law , may lead to irreparable consequences in our bilateral relations . "
bildunterschrift : many of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to israeli hospitals turkey has long been an important ally of israel , one of only a few in the muslim world .
but relations have declined since israel 's attack on gaza a year and a half ago , in which some 1,400 palestinians died and of which turkey was very critical .
on monday , hundreds of demonstrators protested outside israeli missions in turkey .
some 400 demonstrators , some carrying palestinian flags , gathered outside the israeli consulate in istanbul , as dozens of police stopped them from approaching the building .
" israel , make no mistake , do not try our patience , " chanted the crowd .
in another demonstration , a crowd of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the residence of israeli ambassador gabby levy in ankara shouting " damn israel " and reciting prayers .
dozens of police were on duty in front of the building .
deadly clashes the six-boat flotilla was organized by several groups , including a turkish human rights organization , and was said to be carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid , as well as pro-palestinian activists .
the ships were in international waters 124 kilometers off the coast of israel when they were intercepted by the israeli navy and boarded by commandos .
demonstrators on the ships clashed with the soldiers .
the israeli army said the demonstrators were armed with knives and clubs and that commandos opened fire after one person on the boat grabbed a weapon from a commando .
the death toll from the incident is unclear , but the israeli military said more than ten activists had been killed and dozens of activists and soldiers were injured .
israeli trade minister binyamin ben-eliezer voiced " regret at all the fatalities , " but added that soldiers had been " set upon with batons and tools , " which forced them to defend themselves .
hamas , the islamist group which controls the gaza strip , issued a call for an " uprising " of muslims and arabs across the world .
israel has imposed a blockade on gaza since 2007 , hoping to prevent weapons and bombmaking supplies from getting into the hands of militants .
but opponents of the measure and some nongovernmental organizations say the blockade has also prevented needed medical supplies and food from getting to the area , a claim israel has denied. svs / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .

the documentary won its first prize shortly after it arrived in movie theatres in the fall of 2009 .
the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .
it was a newspaper clip that got me interested , ” says boote .
“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
it ’ s a chemical substance from the production of plastics that people suspect causes allergies and influences the hormonal system . ”
this was a defining moment for boote , who then decided to look more intensively at how plastics can threaten our health and the environment .
the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .
the reaction from the plastics industry also shows that it is time to take boote seriously .
for 18 months , “ plasticseurope ” didn ’ t respond to any of his phone calls .
but the premiere of the film was important enough for them to create five-page dossier : suggestions on how to respond and react to the film .
boote uses shocking scenes in his documentary and delivers many facts .
for example , that 40 years ago , five million tons of plastic were produced in europe .
today it is 60 million tons – one-fourth of the total world production .
at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , the austrian filmmaker wants to use constructive criticism : “ we have to ask ourselves : what do i really need ?
how can i contribute ?
at some point you will realize that it ’ s cool to think about consumption . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .

that is a problem for greece as the tourism sector is the country 's biggest source of foreign currency .
about 30,000 room reservations were cancelled in athens in may alone after protesters set fire to a bank , killing three people , according to the country 's hotel association pox .
deutsche welle talked to greek tourism minister georgios nikitiadis about the country 's debt crisis and the impact it has had on the tourism industry .
dw : why should a tourist visit greece , especially this year ?
is there something special that greece offers ?
nikitiadis : there are three or four very , very important reasons why a person should visit greece : one is that greece is one of the most beautiful countries in the world : nice beaches , nice sand .
everywhere you go in greece you face beauty .
the second reason : very , very few countries in the world offer a civilization like the one we offer .
the third basic reason is that our prices have fallen by more that 20 percent , becoming more competitive than at any other time .
people are scared to travel to greece after the violence especially with their families .
many people are afraid – because of the strikes for example - visiting greece could turn into an odyssey .
that 's far away from the reality , because greece has no more strikes than other countries in europe .
greek airlines and airlines operating in greece do not go on strike more than any other country .
and a couple of days ago we had an airline strike .
do n't forget the word " philoxenia " .
it 's a greek word .
it means " friend of the stranger , friend of somebody who comes from abroad " .
so i think there should n't be any concern at all .
greece is a very safe , a very secure place : at least just as secure as any other large european country .
a lot of germans are scared to visit greece because of worsening german-greek relations .
we love the german people , as we always did .
they are more than welcome .
we never had anything against the german people whatsoever .
i understand that there has been a lot of media coverage about german-greek relations reported in a number of publications .
but we know that the german people love us .
there is nothing that can come between us . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in afghanistan but david scheffer , who participated in the original rome statute negotiations , rejects obama 's reasoning out of hand .
he says the us military stands to benefit from a process that helps to make other countries comply with the laws of war .
" an international criminal court is fundamental force protection for the united states military , " scheffer said .
at the kampala conference , delegates will be looking at how effective the court can really be in helping to resolve domestic conflicts and how it can best contribute to the prevention of future crimes . in that vein , last year ocampo issued an international arrest warrant against sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
but many arab and african governments have continued their relations with him regardless .

the documentary won its first prize shortly after it arrived in movie theatres in the fall of 2009 .
the 44-year-old filmmaker will discuss artificial worlds , endangered fish and climate change at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
boote has made a name for himself as a music producer and director , but his family from vienna has a history in plastics – but that ’ s not where he got the idea for his film .
“ the idea didn ’ t come from the fact that my grandfather worked in the plastics industry .
it was a newspaper clip that got me interested , ” says boote .
“ fish couldn ’ t reproduce because they were carrying bisphenol a -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
it ’ s a chemical substance from the production of plastics that people suspect causes allergies and influences the hormonal system . ”
this was a defining moment for boote , who then decided to look more intensively at how plastics can threaten our health and the environment .
the author had high hopes for the film .
climate change became a hot topic because of al gore . “ i hope that ‘ plastic planet ’ turns out just like that , ” boote said .
the topic has been making waves and is even being taught in schools .
the reaction from the plastics industry also shows that it is time to take boote seriously .
for 18 months , “ plasticseurope ” didn ’ t respond to any of his phone calls .
but the premiere of the film was important enough for them to create five-page dossier : suggestions on how to respond and react to the film .
boote uses shocking scenes in his documentary and delivers many facts .
for example , that 40 years ago , five million tons of plastic were produced in europe .
today it is 60 million tons – one-fourth of the total world production .
at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , the austrian filmmaker wants to use constructive criticism : “ we have to ask ourselves : what do i really need ?
how can i contribute ?
at some point you will realize that it ’ s cool to think about consumption . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .
co-host of the deutsche welle global media forum is the foundation for international dialogue of the sparkasse in bonn .
the convention is also supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office , the family , women and integration ministry of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , european funds for regional development , the city of bonn , dhl , the ksb group and faber-castell . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ashton " extends her sympathies to the families of the dead and wounded and is demanding a full inquiry into the circumstances of how this event happened , " a spokesman said monday .
" she reiterates the european union 's position regarding gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive . "
the incident has been met with widespread condemnation from across europe and at the united nations security council , which has issued a formal demand for an impartial investigation .
in an unusually strongly worded statement , german chancellor angela merkel 's office said israel 's response to the ships was disproportionate .
" every german government has always recognized and supported the right of israel to defend itself , but this right must of course be within the boundaries of proportionality , " merkel 's spokesman said .
" at first glance it does not look like this basic rule was adhered to . "
germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle said he was " deeply concerned about the events last night in the waters off gaza ... these are disconcerting initial reports . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said " nothing can justify " the violence .
ambassadors from the 27 eu member nations were to hold an emergency meeting monday afternoon to discuss the incident .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt on monday said it was important to " quickly establish " what happened on the boats .
he said he had summoned the israeli ambassador to get more information .
he said that he had been in touch with ashton , and that the eu must give " a clear response during the day when we get a clearer picture of what has happened . "
authorities in spain and greece have also summoned the israeli ambassadors in their countries for information .
greek government officials announced that they would withdraw from planned joint military exercises with israel in protest .
turkish outrage turkey 's foreign ministry warned of " irreparable consequences " after the incident and announced at midday that they would be recalling their ambassador to israel .
some of the ships were sailing under turkish flags and media reports indicate that turkish nationals are among the dead .
" by targeting civilians , israel has once again shown its disregard for human life and peaceful initiatives .
we strongly condemn these inhumane practices of israel , " the turkish foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this deplorable incident , which took place in open sees and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law , may lead to irreparable consequences in our bilateral relations . "
bildunterschrift : many of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to israeli hospitals turkey has long been an important ally of israel , one of only a few in the muslim world .

the law is a response to legislation passed by the hungarian parliament last wednesday making it easier for ethnic hungarians living in neighboring countries to acquire hungarian citizenship .
many ethnic hungarians , including more than half a million living in slovakia , reside in areas that were once part of hungary until the end of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little booklet has created a big problem the slovak government condemned the hungarian move , calling it a security risk .
hungary lost territory after world war i the new slovak law now requires any slovak who acquires another citizenship to inform the authorities immediately , or face stiff fines .
in addition , government employees , including lawmakers , police or intelligence officers , will lose their jobs if they become dual citizens .
hungary lost two-thirds of its territory after world war i and some 2.5 million hungarians found themselves citizens of foreign states in romania , serbia , ukraine and what is now the czech republic and slovakia when the victorious allies and a reluctant hungary signed the post-war trianon peace treaty .

that is a problem for greece as the tourism sector is the country 's biggest source of foreign currency .
about 30,000 room reservations were cancelled in athens in may alone after protesters set fire to a bank , killing three people , according to the country 's hotel association pox .
deutsche welle talked to greek tourism minister georgios nikitiadis about the country 's debt crisis and the impact it has had on the tourism industry .
dw : why should a tourist visit greece , especially this year ?
is there something special that greece offers ?
nikitiadis : there are three or four very , very important reasons why a person should visit greece : one is that greece is one of the most beautiful countries in the world : nice beaches , nice sand .
everywhere you go in greece you face beauty .
the second reason : very , very few countries in the world offer a civilization like the one we offer .
the third basic reason is that our prices have fallen by more that 20 percent , becoming more competitive than at any other time .
people are scared to travel to greece after the violence especially with their families .
many people are afraid – because of the strikes for example - visiting greece could turn into an odyssey .
that 's far away from the reality , because greece has no more strikes than other countries in europe .
greek airlines and airlines operating in greece do not go on strike more than any other country .
and a couple of days ago we had an airline strike .
do n't forget the word " philoxenia " .
it 's a greek word .
it means " friend of the stranger , friend of somebody who comes from abroad " .
so i think there should n't be any concern at all .
greece is a very safe , a very secure place : at least just as secure as any other large european country .
a lot of germans are scared to visit greece because of worsening german-greek relations .
we love the german people , as we always did .
they are more than welcome .
we never had anything against the german people whatsoever .
i understand that there has been a lot of media coverage about german-greek relations reported in a number of publications .
but we know that the german people love us .
there is nothing that can come between us . "

everywhere you go in greece you face beauty .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer is to stand down after the bonn talks poor countries set new demands developing countries , meanwhile , have raised new demands and pressed developed countries to take greater responsibility for climate change .
in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their race to showcase the commonwealth games and to present delhi as clean and prosperous , the city 's administrators have ridden roughshod over some of the capital 's poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
the department of social welfare has announced " no-tolerance " zones in delhi and there are plans to send beggars back to their states of origin .
a housing and land right network report recently revealed that beggars and homeless people were already being arbitrarily arrested and detained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beggars have been detained as the authorities try to " clean up " the city deplorable living and working conditions the authorities have also turned a blind eye to the working conditions for thousands of workers , many of whom do not even earn the minimum wage and are forced to work in an unsafe environment .
anjali alexander , the chairperson of mobile crèches , a ngo that campaigns for the safety of workers on construction sites , says that the " human cost paid to have this mega-event is the displacement of thousands of families and the removal of slums . "
" all the hawkers have been removed .
wherever they can not remove the slums , they will put up lovely bamboo screens so that tourists and sports people do not see the unseemly sight .
the work and living conditions are terrible .
there is no safety for children .
women are turned away because they do not want children hanging around on the sites . "
delayed payment of wages rajendra kumar , a migrant labourer from rajasthan , has been working on beautifying roads for the past six months with a group from his village .
he says contractors have not been paying him on time and also paying less than the stipulated wages .
" i do n't understand this .
sometimes they say i will get paid after a week and then they postpone that .
it is tough when you do n't get money on time .
the contractors make fools of us .
there are a lot of problems but we have no choice .
we need to eat at the end of the day . "
a committee appointed by the delhi high court recently also pointed out that the rights of laborers were being violated on the construction sites .
workers were found to be living in deplorable hygienic conditions and it was revealed that there were not enough toilets for the large number of workers .
the committee indicted the regulators concerned for their failure to comply with labor laws .
high security during commonwealth games security for the games is another major concern .
there will be over 2,000 cctv cameras set up on roads as well as hundreds inside the competition venues to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commonwealth games mascot ' shera ' but security expert ajay sahni said the games would be safe saying that there was enough capacity and " a tremendous concentration of intelligence activity preceding the games . "
the games are expected to cost the organizers over 15 billion us dollars .
however , in view of the discomfort to many , some are wondering whether the cost of this massive facelift is really worth it and equal to the pride that hosting the commonwealth games will bring .
the commonwealth games will take place from 3 to 14 october 2010 .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .
" but what we have criticized , is his neo-liberal bias .
he was always a supporter of agenda 2010 and hartz iv , failed labor market policies which we are known to be against . "
yet the neo-liberal tag faded somewhat in recent years .
in the light of the global financial crisis , he made an appeal last march for a stronger , bigger state to bring the markets under control .
furthermore , he expressed doubt that economic growth was the solution to all problems and sympathized with the idea of a new green deal .

although his position was largely ceremonial , koehler was one of germany 's more popular politicians . koehler was elected to power as the ninth german president on may 23 , 2004 , at the suggestion of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
five years later , he was re-elected for a second term .
since the position is largely ceremonial , the record of a german president is not necessarily measured by successful reforms , passing new laws or overcoming government crises .
rather , much of it depends on the reputation left behind with the people .
in this regard , horst koehler was quite successful , as two-thirds of german citizens believed he should stay in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president was well liked among the german people the official head of state was simultaneously the most popular politician in the country .
" he does n't portray anyone other than his real self - an honest man , " wrote heribert prantl in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
when koehler announced his bid for re-election , german chancellor angela merkel spoke highly of him .
" i believe in the last few years , he has won over the hearts of the people in germany , " said merkel .
" he has an open way of approaching people , and an ability to speak about hard truths . "
ridiculed by politicos , respected by the people at times , koehler would be ridiculed in some of berlin 's elite political circles as being only a bank director , referring to his previous positions as head of the association of german savings banks , as well as head of the international monetary fund .
however , such criticism only made koehler more popular among citizens .
koehler was not known as a big visionary or one to make rousing speeches , as he was not a good orator .
instead , he compensated for this through his diligence , his visible struggles to find the answers to problems , and his honest curiosity , which many veteran politicians would only pretend to have .
social equalities within germany , koehler pushed for better education among youths , including immigrants .
his global vision focused on the challenges of globalization and the growing gap between the rich and the poor .
the former president also took a particular interest in africa , which he often visited .
" in my view , the humanity of our world is defined by the fate of africa , " said koehler .
" we now know that it would have been less risky to build a train line across africa than to invest in a respected new york investment bank . "
an uncomfortable president koehler made good his promise to be an ' uncomfortable ' president .
he twice refused to pass laws drawn up by the former grand coalition of the cdu and spd and voiced concern about several others , but left the final decision to the constitutional court .
however , koehler 's most important official act was the dissolution of the german parliament , or bundestag , in july 2005 at the request of former chancellor gerhard schroeder .
during a hectic time in german politics , koehler gave the green light for new elections , something which the majority of germans also supported .
with his constant calls for reform , koehler emancipated himself from chancellor merkel and the cdu , who backed his original candidacy .
sometimes , his background as an economist came through .
for example , he criticized the grand coalition for extending unemployment benefits .
he also repeatedly praised gerhard schroeder for his controversial 2010 reform agenda and hartz iv social reforms , something which brought him criticism from germany 's left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took a particular interest in development aid to africa " he has made an effort to be a good president , there 's no doubt about it , " said former left party leader oskar lafontaine .

but the country 's constitution has clear guidelines on what happens next - and a power vacuum is not in sight . president horst koehler 's resignation is an unheard-of event in germany , but it will not result in a power vacuum .
according to the constitution , the head of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany 's federal states , takes over at this point .
every year , one of the 16 state premiers takes on the position of bundesrat president .
the present incumbent is jens boehrnsen , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- mayor of bremen .
boehrnsen will take over all of the federal president 's duties until an electoral college , the federal convention , elects a successor for koehler .
the federal convention must convene within 30 days - in this case , by june 30 . the federal convention is germany 's largest parliamentary body , and is solely responsible for the selection of the federal president .
all of the members of the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , are entitled to vote , as well as a corresponding number of representatives from the federal states .
the convention last met a year ago , in may 2009 , to re-elect koehler . then , it numbered 1,224 delegates .
germany could be in for a difficult vote the federal president is elected by secret ballot , without a prior debate , and requires an absolute majority .
should none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round , then the candidate who receives a simple majority in a third round of voting is considered elected as president .
germany 's head of state is not elected by the people .
as a rule , the political parties suggest candidates , not necessarily someone from within their ranks but a respected public figure capable of representing germany across party boundaries .
horst koehler , for instance , was supported by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the current ruling coalition in berlin .
this presidential election promises to be interesting because of the unclear situation in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which dispatches the greatest number of delegates to the federal convention .
the newly-elected parliament in duesseldorf does not have a governing majority yet , as coalition talks are still underway .
the result of these talks could have an effect on which way the nrw delegates votes . as a rule , federal convention delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice , but generally , they do adhere to their respective parties ' recommendations . author : daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- db -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a national mission in recent years , german contestants have been no stranger to the bottom tier at europe 's top song competition .
german viewers were more inclined to poke fun at the event than tune in .
facing a downward spiral , the powers that be at public broadcaster ard - germany 's eurovision broadcaster - knew they had one big chance to turn things around .
in what seemed like a last-ditch effort , or an act of desperation , the station teamed up with private channel prosieben to put germany 's contestant for this year 's competition on air .
luck was on their side : popular german television personality stefan raab - who shares a well-documented love of music - took on the role as head judge in the preliminary talent search for 2010 . in another stroke of good fortune , raab proved to the competition at germany 's most popular casting show " dsds " that this kind of contest could be done - and done well - without humiliating the contestants along the way .
it 's the singer , not the song out of 4,500 aspiring competitors who applied to appear on the multi-part series " our star for oslo , " 10 made it through .
but it was clear from the very start that lena meyer-landrut had something that no other contestant had .
as stefan raab put it , " when she gets on stage , everything blossoms . "
technical perfection was n't what counted in the preliminary competition .
several of lena 's competitors were more polished singers , but lena 's charisma and contagious feel-good persona were one-of-a-kind .
her song for oslo , " satellite , " was a catchy but run-of-the mill piece of pop music .
it was the singer , not the song , that made the difference : lena 's performance got people to take a closer listen .
breaking the rules over the years , the eurovision song contest has created a parallel universe of kitsch and pomp .
the world 's biggest tv event , it features over-the-top performances , tacky costumes and songs that might be unbearable to anyone who lacks a secret fondness for bad music .
lena 's decision to opt out of the gaudy spectacle was a wise one - but it would only work for someone with her special charm .
where others relied on pyrotechnics and led outfits , lena took the stage as lena , pure and simple .
since february , she 's weathered the media circus , completed her school-leaving exams and recorded her first album , but lena still comes through as authentic - and anything but routine .
with a deliberate non-marketing strategy , she won over germany - and then the rest of europe .
a little lena in everyone little is known about lena 's personal life , and the singer is kept away from tabloid media - and that 's what makes her so relatable .
she 's confident , young , cheeky - a bit zany - but ambitious : who would n't want to be the very same way ?
we 've had enough of empty promises , media fabrications and artificial emotions .
let 's just enjoy the moment and be glad the lena phenomenon has bridged a generation gap , challenged the superstar top-model mold - and of course , that because of her , germany will have the honor of hosting next year 's eurovision song contest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 31.05.2010 who takes aim at tobacco ads targeting women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young and female : a key target group for tobacco firms the tobacco industry is trying to convert more women to smoking , says the world health organization .
on this year 's world no tobacco day , the group has created a counter-campaign to combat the trend . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has put cigarette advertising aimed at women at the center of its annual world no tobacco day .
the organization says the tobacco industry is unscrupulous in its attempts to market cigarettes to young women in general , especially in the developing world .
douglas bettcher , the director of the who 's tobacco free initiative , told deutsche welle that the prevalence of deadly diseases among smokers , such as cancer , emphysema , and heart disease , means the tobacco industry is " always looking for new populations , such as young women , to light up and support their profit motives . "
and the group 's web site claims that " women are the main targets of the tobacco industry 's efforts to win new consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakarta , indonesia was blasted for its laissez-faire smoking rules there is certainly more room for growth in the market for female smokers , statistics show .
across the world , just 9 percent of women and 40 percent of men currently smoke .
meanwhile , a who study of 151 countries shows 7 percent of adolescent girls smoke , compared with 12 percent of adolescent boys .
female smokers are catching up to male smokers , according to statistics .
in several countries - including , in europe , bulgaria , croatia , and the czech republic - the number of female tobacco users outweighs the male users , the who study showed .
counter-campaign trades beauty for illness the trend is worrisome , who says .
its new report entitled " women and health : today 's evidence , tomorrow 's agenda , " cites evidence that tobacco advertising increasingly targets girls .
thus for this year 's world no tobacco day , the health agency decided to highlight the tobacco industry 's tactics of associating tobacco use with beauty and freedom in its advertising .
one part of this year 's campaign was creating a series of hard-hitting posters that show attractive , but extremely ill , smokers , such as a model with mouth cancer or a tracheotomy tube .
" this campaign calls attention to the tobacco industry 's attempts to market its deadly products by associating tobacco use with beauty and liberation , " who assistant director-general for noncommunicable diseases and mental health , ala alwan , said .
cigarette marketing has become especially unscrupulous in parts of africa and asia , said adepju olukoya , who works on gender and health issues for who .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking women were often considered sophisticated " the industry has studied what makes women tick in both developed and developing countries .
in many developing countries especially , the young people want to be part of the global advance of fashion , in music , in being ' with it ' , " she told deutsche welle .
" so the tobacco industry uses this effectively by promoting sports events and concert events that draw young people - both male and female , " she added . sobering statistics challenging the millions of dollars spent on cigarette marketing wo n't be easy , but the who is trying .
even though it is unlikely that its posters will be seen by as many young women as see the cigarette advertisements , the organization hopes they will deter at least some women from lighting up .
" the world no tobacco day -lrb- poster -rrb- campaign seeks to turn the tables on the tobacco industry , showing tobacco use in its true light , " who 's bettcher said .
" no one should be fooled ...
tobacco is not stylish .
it is deadly and addictive . "
tobacco use kills more than five million people every year , about 1.5 million of whom are women , who says .
about half of long-term smokers die from tobacco related illness , the group says .
in general , statistics show women are more vulnerable to tobacco-related illnesses , according to germany 's federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- .
the group says second-hand smoke is a particular threat to women , especially pregnant women and their babies .
according to bzga , 26 percent of german women and 34 percent of german men are smokers .
long history of women and tobacco the who 's poster campaign is just the latest salvo in a long fight between health agencies and the tobacco industry over the targeting of women and girls .
in the 1920s , lucky strike cigarettes first linked smoking to weight control by urging women to " reach for a lucky instead of a sweet . "
in the 1960s , philip morris introduced virginia slims , the first cigarette brand created specifically for women and targeted to that consumer group .
and in the 1970s , tobacco companies targeted women with ads implying that " light " and " low tar " cigarettes were safer for consumption - despite knowing this was not the case , the us anti-smoking advocacy group tobacco free kids says .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer is to stand down after the bonn talks poor countries set new demands developing countries , meanwhile , have raised new demands and pressed developed countries to take greater responsibility for climate change .
in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .

in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .

but expectations are muted after the high-profile failure of the copenhagen climate summit . a new round of climate talks resumes in bonn on monday to prepare for the upcoming united nations climate summit in cancun , mexico , in december , but expectations of a big agreement are not high after the failure of the copenhagen summit six months ago .
the main aim of the negotiations , under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , is to negotiate a text setting out a framework agreement for a new climate pact to replace the kyoto protocol .
unfccc chief yvo de boer admits that any treaty is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2011 .
de boer tendered his resignation after last december 's copenhagen climate change talks , which ended in widespread disappointment and frustration with only vague promises to cut co2 emissions .
leaders from 194 countries were supposed to finalize a legally binding post-2012 treaty to replace the kyoto protocol .
all they came up with was a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a pledge to assist developing countries combat climate change .
no climate deal in 2010 speaking at a news conference in bonn de boer said he was less than optimistic that the stalled un climate talks would reach a consensus by the end of this year .
" it 's extremely unlikely that we will see a legally binding agreement in cancun , " the un 's top official on climate change said in a teleconference with journalists .
" i think that especially developing countries would want to see what an agreement would entail for them before they would be willing to turn it into a legally-binding treaty . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un seeks long-term global solution to the climate challenge last month un secretary-general ban ki-moon named costa rica 's christiana figueres to replace de boer .
analysts expect her to shift the emphasis from legally binding emission cuts to developing green technologies .
the 12-day bonn meeting will attempt to unravel some of the decisions made at the failed copenhagen talks .
the so-called copenhagen accord sets a voluntary goal of limiting warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
it was brokered by a couple of dozen leaders in the summit 's final desperate hours . to show that the accord has credibility - and restore trust in the overall process - developing countries are now calling on industrialized countries to honor their pledges of financial support .
debt crisis under the copenhagen accord , the european union , the united states , japan and other wealthy countries pledged $ 30 billion -lrb- 24.3 billion euros -rrb- in aid from 2010-2012 , with a promise of contributing 100 billion dollars a year by the end of the decade . faced with the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone , the eu appears to be backpedaling on its initial goal of unilaterally cutting co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 against 1990 levels to " kick-start " climate action in developing countries .
eu commissioner for climate change connie hedegaard said last week that conditions for a 30-percent move " are clearly not met . "
the eu had previously proposed increasing their target to 30 percent from 20 percent if other countries followed suit as part of a new climate deal .
a study presented by the eu commissioner estimated that this would cost eu countries 81 billion euros .
" of course , it 's not an easy time to discuss money that comes out of the public purse right now , " said hedegaard .
france and germany - the eu 's two largest economies - have warned member countries to tread carefully on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvo de boer is to stand down after the bonn talks poor countries set new demands developing countries , meanwhile , have raised new demands and pressed developed countries to take greater responsibility for climate change .
in a 42-page document prepared ahead of the 12-day bonn talks , bolivia asked rich nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 100 percent from 1990 levels by 2040 .
environmental groups , such as the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , have tried to breathe new life into the stalled talks .
" copenhagen failed to produce the accord which the world needs , but it did achieve important progress in some aspects , " said regine guenther , head of wwf 's climate policy .
the bonn negotiations should focus on these points , said guenther , and bring it to a conclusion at the next un climate conference in mexico .
credibility gap according to the wwf delegates in bonn could resolve issues like the finance , deforestation , and technology transfer in cancun and then endorse a global treaty in 2011 in south africa . " progress in these areas would signal that the international community continues to be serious about working on a new accord .
the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol expires in 2012 .
in south africa , at the latest , it must be clear how it will continue after that , " added guenther .
delegates also need to address the huge gap between previous commitments made by kyoto treaty signatories and the necessary emission reductions of individual countries , said the swiss-based organization. nrt / afp / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law is a response to legislation passed by the hungarian parliament last wednesday making it easier for ethnic hungarians living in neighboring countries to acquire hungarian citizenship .
many ethnic hungarians , including more than half a million living in slovakia , reside in areas that were once part of hungary until the end of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little booklet has created a big problem the slovak government condemned the hungarian move , calling it a security risk .
hungary lost territory after world war i the new slovak law now requires any slovak who acquires another citizenship to inform the authorities immediately , or face stiff fines .
in addition , government employees , including lawmakers , police or intelligence officers , will lose their jobs if they become dual citizens .
hungary lost two-thirds of its territory after world war i and some 2.5 million hungarians found themselves citizens of foreign states in romania , serbia , ukraine and what is now the czech republic and slovakia when the victorious allies and a reluctant hungary signed the post-war trianon peace treaty .

he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .
a new president will need to be sworn in by june 30. gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that has led to cries of imbalance from countries in the african union .
but president of the chamber of preliminary proceedings in the hague , german judge hans peter kaul says there is nothing unfair about the cases the court has chosen to pursue .
“ there are very simple reasons why crimes in uganda , the democratic republic of the congo and in the central african republic are being investigated . ”
in the three examples kaul cites , the governments themselves referred them to the icc because they recognised a need for help in processing crimes committed on their turf .
cautious optimism nonetheless , the process of pinpointing individual perpetrators is difficult , not least because it is simultaneously a judgement on the misconduct of the relevant nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc issued an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar al-bashir which is why some states feel an extended jurisdiction of the court could encroach on their sovereignty .
not least when the proposed extension relates to the contentious issue of crimes of aggression .
while the icc officially has jurisdiction over state aggression , the 111 member states have never formally agreed on the definition of the crime .
it is hoped they will do so during the kampala conference .
speaking ahead of the meeting , president of the icc 's assembly of state parties , christian wenaweser said he was " cautiously optimistic " that member states could reach a deal on the controversial issue .
he said it would be " a significant step forward in the development of international law and an important extension of the court 's jurisdiction . "
definitive definition informally delegates have agreed that only state and army leaders could be indicted and only if the war of aggression were in breach of the un charter .
but the real challenge is to determine who has the power to decide whether a war is just and initiate an investigation accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council france , england and the us say the job should fall to the un security council .
but as wenaweser explains , not everyone wants the same thing .
" some countries view it as an exclusive security council right , " he said .
" but others say it would lead to the politicisation of the icc . " in the case of the former , the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , china , france and england could stop the icc from indicting their own citizens or their allies by using their power of veto .
until now germany has been opposed to such a role for the security council .
but there are others in kampala who are for it , so for the time being it 's a case of wait and see .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 31.05.2010 opinion : the european external action service 's role in eu development policymaking requires safeguards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu aid service is to increase europe 's global role guest commentator mark furness argues that clear safeguards are required to ensure that future eu development policy serves both global development and european foreign policy goals . the lisbon treaty requires that european union foreign policy does no harm to development objectives , while calling for development cooperation to be conducted within the framework of external action .
the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .
coordinating cooperation second , the eeas should be part of a coordinated intra-eu development cooperation structure .
the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .
replacing ring-fences with safeguards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official development aid from europe increased in 2009 , despite the financial crisis the european commission is the appropriate body to ensure that development is safeguarded as its responsibilities for managing oda are enshrined in the eu treaties .
dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .
development power europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- is a leading european thinktank the lisbon treaty marks a milestone in the emergence of the eu as an international actor .
the blueprint for achieving a greater global role is not to try to ” speak with one voice ” on every issue , but to focus on the eu 's strengths in policy areas where it can make a difference .
as a development actor the eu has huge resources and more reach than individual member states .
the eu is also better at repetitive legalese than at mobilising hard power .
this does not capture headlines but is essential for pursuing global development objectives .
the full implications of the lisbon treaty are not yet clear , but the trend towards integration in eu external relations , development and foreign policy is real , and development will have an increasingly important role .
many of europe 's foreign policy and security interests are also development issues : state fragility and illegal migration are just two examples .
those tasked with designing the eu 's external relations architecture have a unique opportunity to serve global development and european foreign policy goals simultaneously .
clearer institutional safeguards for eu development policy would make an important contribution on both fronts .

the treaty , which entered into force on 1 december 2009 , entrenches development policy as a ” shared competence ” under the mandate of both high representative for common foreign and security policy -lrb- csfp -rrb- catherine ashton and development commissioner andris piebalgs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu high representative catherine ashton proposed the new eu external action service the eu council approved ashton 's proposal establishing the european external action service -lrb- eeas -rrb- in late april .
the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .
coordinating cooperation second , the eeas should be part of a coordinated intra-eu development cooperation structure .
the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .
replacing ring-fences with safeguards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official development aid from europe increased in 2009 , despite the financial crisis the european commission is the appropriate body to ensure that development is safeguarded as its responsibilities for managing oda are enshrined in the eu treaties .
dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .

the intention is to improve the links between development and foreign policy , combine the european commission 's technical expertise with the council 's political weight , and thus increase the eu 's global role .
development policy will not be as strongly ring-fenced as before the lisbon treaty and clear institutional safeguards are needed if the treaty 's letter and spirit is to be observed in three areas : policy coherence for development needed first , the eeas must facilitate policy coherence for development .
ashton 's proposal envisages that the priorities of the common foreign and security policy will inform development policy and vice-versa .
the risk that short-term political or economic interests will overshadow development objectives should not be overstated .
it makes sense for the eu to put development at the forefront of its external action rather than policies where its capabilities are limited .
this is of course no safeguard – robust measures promoting policy coherence are needed to reduce development 's vulnerability to crisis politics .
coordinating cooperation second , the eeas should be part of a coordinated intra-eu development cooperation structure .
the eeas will share responsibility for programming the eu 's official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- instruments with the commission 's directorate-general -lrb- dg -rrb- for development .
oda programming documents are to be prepared by the eeas working closely with commission colleagues under the ” direct supervision and guidance ” of commissioner piebalgs .
however , ashton 's proposal does not clearly delineate the eeas ' and the commission 's roles on the key coordination questions of who will set the agenda and how the commissioner will exercise oversight .
third , the eeas must be accepted as legitimate .
although eu officials are careful to refer to the eeas as a ” service ” and not an ” institution ” , ashton 's proposal establishes ” a functionally autonomous body ” , treated as an ” institution ” within the eu 's financial regulation .
it is unclear how the eeas will be controlled once it is established as a policy-making body .
furthermore , the european parliament , which must give its consent before the eeas becomes operational , rejected the proposal due to concerns about the role of the commission and parliamentary oversight of senior eeas appointments and decisions involving community funds .
replacing ring-fences with safeguards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official development aid from europe increased in 2009 , despite the financial crisis the european commission is the appropriate body to ensure that development is safeguarded as its responsibilities for managing oda are enshrined in the eu treaties .
dg development should retain influence over policy decisions concerning the eu 's oda instruments .
ashton 's proposal states that commission and eeas staff will work together on the first three programming stages , and that proposals will be jointly submitted to the college of commissioners , effectively creating a ” dual key ” -lrb- or veto -rrb- over oda programming .
there is no formal statement that the dual key will operate throughout the process and not only once a proposal is on the table .
there is also no indication of what would happen in rare cases of disagreement – whether the college of commissioners or the foreign affairs council would have the final say .
the commission also needs to strengthen its independent monitoring function so that coherence , coordination , ownership and effectiveness issues are reported from a development perspective .
europeaid staff will be on the ground in eu delegations , and need to be able to influence the dual key through clear lines of communication to policymakers in brussels .
the commission 's policy and monitoring roles would be strengthened by institutionalising the “ power of the purse ” .
a merger with europeaid would increase dg development 's control over operational budgets and thereby its political relevance . ” soft law ” has long guided eu development policy and it is understandable that ashton 's proposal leaves certain processes to be bedded in over time .
nevertheless , formal institutional protections to keep development at the forefront of the eu 's external policy should be there from the outset .
clarifying dg development 's role would foster policy coherence , improve coordination , and facilitate consensus among the european external action service , the commission , the european parliament , member states and partner countries .
development power europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- is a leading european thinktank the lisbon treaty marks a milestone in the emergence of the eu as an international actor .
the blueprint for achieving a greater global role is not to try to ” speak with one voice ” on every issue , but to focus on the eu 's strengths in policy areas where it can make a difference .
as a development actor the eu has huge resources and more reach than individual member states .
the eu is also better at repetitive legalese than at mobilising hard power .
this does not capture headlines but is essential for pursuing global development objectives .
the full implications of the lisbon treaty are not yet clear , but the trend towards integration in eu external relations , development and foreign policy is real , and development will have an increasingly important role .
many of europe 's foreign policy and security interests are also development issues : state fragility and illegal migration are just two examples .
those tasked with designing the eu 's external relations architecture have a unique opportunity to serve global development and european foreign policy goals simultaneously .
clearer institutional safeguards for eu development policy would make an important contribution on both fronts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer politics -pipe- 31.05.2010 german public and politicians stunned by president 's resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler is the first german president to resign without notice german president horst koehler stunned the public by suddenly stepping down amid an ongoing controversy over comments he made about afghanistan .
he is the first german president to resign without notice . in a move that took just about everybody by surprise , german president horst koehler stepped down on monday , citing comments he made about afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
a visibly emotional koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " i am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" it was an honor for me to serve germany as president , " he said . " i thank the many people in germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
i ask for you to understand my decision . "
bildunterschrift : his wife eva luise was by his side during the announcement german foreign minister guido westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " mr. koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
bavaria 's state premier , horst seehofer , said mr. koehler " had won the sympathies of the german people and was widely respected abroad . "
the president 's resignation caught germany 's political parties completely off guard .
chancellor angela merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
after she was informed of his decision , merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the german national soccer team , which is currently training in northern italy for the world cup next month .
at a press conference in berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by mr. koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
she also said " the people of germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
koehler said , besides merkel and westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the federal constitutional court , andreas vosskuhle , and jens boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
the resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election in north rhine-westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , hesse state premier roland koch , just last week .
bildunterschrift : koehler recently visited isaf troops announcing his decision , mr. koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
in the past few days , koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold german interests .
koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in afghanistan , where germany has 4,500 troops in a nato-led force fighting a taliban-led insurgency .
polls show that a majority of germans are opposed to the mission in afghanistan .
but the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
a former managing director of the international monetary fund , koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
according to the german constitution , boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .
a new president will need to be sworn in by june 30. gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
