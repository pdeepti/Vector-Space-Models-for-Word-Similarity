a majority of 64 percent say they celebrate christmas alongside other important occasions .
nineteen percent regard christmas as the most significant holiday of the year .
bildunterschrift : under soviet rule , the communist regime suppressed religion and marginalized christmas , instead focusing on the new year as the main holiday of the year .
after the fall of communism , christian celebrations and the christian orthodox religion came back into favor , as many russians turned to the church and religion in the wake of political turmoil in the 1990s .
many russians are religious the deutsche welle poll found that just under a third of russians - 29 percent - consider themselves religious , with most of those saying they go to church on holidays like christmas .
three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .
bildunterschrift : according to the poll , many young people are religious , with just 16 percent of russians under the age of 29 saying they do not believe in god .
russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .
bildunterschrift : but according to the deutsche welle poll , many russians would support a closer relationship between the two churches .
almost half of those polled are in favor of a meeting between the pope benedict xvi and kyrill i. forty percent say they are neutral on this issue .
a small minority of just 2 percent are opposed to such a meeting .
the ifak institute surveyed 1,000 russians in december 2010 .
the margin of error is no more than 3 percent .

critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "

critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schalke 's win caps an impressive recent run , and prompted coach felix magath to grant his players more time off over christmas . schalke won their last match of 2010 , beating german second division leaders augsburg 1-0 in the german cup .
the victory secured the royal blues a place in the quarter-finals , and it also earned them a longer christmas holiday .
last month coach felix magath , angered by his club 's dreadful start to the season , had curtailed the players ' vacation time , ordering them back to training on december 27 .
" i 'm very satisfied , and that 's why we 'll all have a break until january 2 , " magath told reporters after the match in augsburg .
" i 'm satisfied with my team 's performance .
it was a tough task , especially considering the condition of the pitch . "
in all competitions , schalke have now won five consecutive games .
after weeks in the relegation zone , they are up to a solid 10th in the bundesliga , and they 're through to the knockout stages of the lucrative champions ' league .
tuesday 's win on a snow-covered augsburg pitch was by no means easy , and it took schalke 84 minutes to find the decisive goal .
veteran spanish striker raul , who has been the personification of schalke 's ice-cold turned red-hot season so far , did the hard work - taking on three defenders and then putting peruvian winger jefferson farfan through to score from the right flank .

icelandic midfielder gylfi sigurdsson opened the scoring for hoffenheim with a trademark free-kick from just outside the area , but a lot of credit for the goal must go to moenchengladbach keeper christofer heimeroth .
instead of shooting over the wall , sigurdsson elected to try his luck on heimeroth 's side of the goal , but as he struck it the gladbach keeper dived away from his station towards the other side of the net in a spectacularly misguided gamble .
senegalese forward demba ba scored hoffenheim 's second on 63 minutes , a short range finish from a sejad salihovic corner that three gladbach defenders failed to clear .
as well as securing them a spot in the last eight , the win broke a run of four consecutive draws for hoffenheim , who have slipped back into mid-table in recent weeks after a very strong start to the season .
for gladbach , however , the result completes a rather miserable run leading up to the christmas holidays .

schalke 's win caps an impressive recent run , and prompted coach felix magath to grant his players more time off over christmas . schalke won their last match of 2010 , beating german second division leaders augsburg 1-0 in the german cup .
the victory secured the royal blues a place in the quarter-finals , and it also earned them a longer christmas holiday .
last month coach felix magath , angered by his club 's dreadful start to the season , had curtailed the players ' vacation time , ordering them back to training on december 27 .
" i 'm very satisfied , and that 's why we 'll all have a break until january 2 , " magath told reporters after the match in augsburg .
" i 'm satisfied with my team 's performance .
it was a tough task , especially considering the condition of the pitch . "
in all competitions , schalke have now won five consecutive games .
after weeks in the relegation zone , they are up to a solid 10th in the bundesliga , and they 're through to the knockout stages of the lucrative champions ' league .
tuesday 's win on a snow-covered augsburg pitch was by no means easy , and it took schalke 84 minutes to find the decisive goal .
veteran spanish striker raul , who has been the personification of schalke 's ice-cold turned red-hot season so far , did the hard work - taking on three defenders and then putting peruvian winger jefferson farfan through to score from the right flank .
hoffenheim pile more misery on moenchengladbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a good day for all the bundesliga 's boys in blue matches pitting offenbach against nuremberg and koblenz against kaiserslautern were both canceled due to bad weather conditions on tuesday , but in the second fixture that did go ahead , hoffenheim beat visitors borussia moenchengladbach 2-0 .
icelandic midfielder gylfi sigurdsson opened the scoring for hoffenheim with a trademark free-kick from just outside the area , but a lot of credit for the goal must go to moenchengladbach keeper christofer heimeroth .
instead of shooting over the wall , sigurdsson elected to try his luck on heimeroth 's side of the goal , but as he struck it the gladbach keeper dived away from his station towards the other side of the net in a spectacularly misguided gamble .
senegalese forward demba ba scored hoffenheim 's second on 63 minutes , a short range finish from a sejad salihovic corner that three gladbach defenders failed to clear .
as well as securing them a spot in the last eight , the win broke a run of four consecutive draws for hoffenheim , who have slipped back into mid-table in recent weeks after a very strong start to the season .
for gladbach , however , the result completes a rather miserable run leading up to the christmas holidays .
as well as dropping out of the german cup with this defeat , moenchengladbach go into the winter break rock bottom of the bundesliga , having also lost five consecutive league matches .
in wednesday 's german cup games - weather permitting - wolfsburg entertain cottbus , duisburg travel to cologne , aachen play host to frankfurt , and stuttgart face a tough home test against bayern munich .

hungary assumes the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . german chancellor angela merkel has warned hungary that a controversial new law to control media reporting must adhere to european union values on freedom of the press .
the chancellor was eager to ensure that the law passed by the hungarian government did not violate european principles on the rule of law , said merkel ’ s deputy spokesman christoph steegmans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the law must not transgress european principles steegmans stressed that such compliance was particularly necessary at present , with hungary preparing to take up the rotating presidency of the eu in january .
" as a future president of the european union , hungary naturally has a special responsibility for the image of the european union as a whole , " he said .
under plans approved by hungary 's parliament on monday , a national media authority will oversee public news production and be able to impose sizeable fines on private media that break rules on political reporting .
representatives voice concern eu parliamentarians also expressed concern about the hungarian government 's strict new media legislation .
" we shall measure hungary against the european standards of press freedom precisely , " said martin schulz , leader of the socialists in the european parliament .
schulz told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau that , should those standards not be met , budapest would face " big problems . "
alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in brussels , called it " extremely dubious " that an eu presidency-designate wanted to " silence critical media in their own country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's martin schulz heads the european parliament 's second biggest bloc " the hungarian government must ask itself if it is absolutely committed to the european union venture , endorses its values and can assume the eu presidency next week , " alvaro said .
press under wraps the hungarian government has said the legislation is in line with that of other eu countries .
it said the law was long overdue , and necessary because of changes in technology and news content .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said that regulating online media was technologically impossible and would damage freedom of expression .
" such concentration of power in regulatory authorities is unprecedented in european democracies , and it harms media freedom , " the osce 's media freedom representative , dunja mijatovic , said .
reporters without borders criticized the new legislation as vague .
" much too much is left open to interpretation , nothing is clear , " olivier basille from the press freedom watchdog told euobserver.com.
basille questioned whether hungary could be a credible representative for the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publications in hungary have protested the new law luxembourg 's foreign minister , jean asselborn , has called for the european commission , the eu 's executive body , to take swift action against the legislation .
" the plans clearly violate the spirit and the letter of eu treaties , " asselborn told news agency reuters .
" it 's a direct danger for democracy .
the state will control opinion . "
board controlled by ruling party the law creates a five-member board to oversee both private and state-run media .
the body , which will be controlled by the ruling right-wing conservative government of prime minister viktor orban 's fidesz party , will be able to impose heavy fines on the producers of radio , television , online and newspaper content that is deemed " not politically balanced . "
earlier this month hungarian newspapers and magazines protested against the law by publishing editions with front pages left blank . the legislation will come into force on january 1 , the same day hungary begins its six-month presidency of the european council .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now some conservative politicians are accusing berlin 's left-wing government of ignoring the late us president 's 100th birthday . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called on berlin to name a street or square after the late american president ronald reagan .
" a street named after this great honorary citizen would be very welcome , " he told the mass-circulation daily newspaper bild .
guttenberg added that berlin 's public expression of gratefulness should not end with rudi dutschke , a leading figure of the german left-wing students ' movement in the 1960s who had a street named after him by the capital 's left-wing government in 2008 .
politicians from the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- supported guttenberg 's call , with cdu foreign policy spokesman ruprecht polenz telling bild he did not think german reunification would have happened at all without reagan .
" ronald reagan brought down the iron curtain with his persistency in deed and clarity in speech , " he said , criticizing the berlin senate for not planning any official memorial service for reagan 's birthday .
" germany and especially berlin have a lot to thank ronald reagan for , " added berlin fdp parliamentarian martin lindner .
the nation 's capital should " permanently remember this great friend of germany in a visible area . "
linder suggested in 2004 that berlin rename the plaza in front of berlin 's central train station from washington-platz in honor of reagan .
reagan gave an iconic speech in front of the brandenburg gate in 1987 , which at the time was part of the border between east and west berlin , in which he called on the then-leader of the soviet union mikhail gorbachev , to tear down the berlin wall .
the latest discussion comes just weeks ahead of what would be reagan 's 100th birthday - on february 6 .

extended train services were meant to help clear the backlog in germany . frankfurt airport was open and running at close to full capacity on wednesday .
seventy flights were canceled out of a scheduled 1,300 .
" the airport operation is getting back to normal , " airport spokesman thomas uber said .
" but it will take a while to catch up . "
there was a backlog of around 3,500 passengers at germany 's busiest hub .
a spokeswoman for london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , said it was operating 70 percent of a normal day 's service on wednesday .
both of heathrow 's runways were open again , but airport operator baa had said that it would need time to move diverted aircraft and crew into position .
british airways said it would only be operating around a third of its flights from heathrow until 6:00 a.m. on thursday .
germany 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it was preparing to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule , although domestic routes would still be disrupted .
the airline reported no problems on wednesday morning .
extra train services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : days of snow and ice have stopped travelers in their tracks airlines were still advising passengers to seek alternative transportation , as they tried to catch up after days of delayed and canceled services .
eurostar , the high-speed rail link between london , paris and brussels , said nine of its 52 trains would be canceled on wednesday , but that passengers would be given seats on the next available trains .
germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , was providing extra train services from wednesday to cope with the high level of demand .
a special long-distance timetable was to run until december 31 .
" we are considerably overburdened , " deutsche bahn board member berthold huber said .
the rail operator bahn planned to concentrate on its busy north-south and east-west routes , pulling some high speed trains away from quieter services . huber estimated that around 50,000 extra passengers per day were looking to make long-distance rail trips over the christmas period . days of travel disruption the european commission on tuesday criticized transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions .
" i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free food and drink has been given out to passengers waiting at frankfurt kallas was particularly critical of airports , and said he would meet with air travel officials in the coming days to look into how they would ensure " minimum service requirements " were met in the future .
around 3,000 flights were canceled across europe on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days .
unexpected snowfall caused frankfurt airport to close for three hours on tuesday morning , while london heathrow canceled two-thirds of all flights .
charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays .

a majority of 64 percent say they celebrate christmas alongside other important occasions .
nineteen percent regard christmas as the most significant holiday of the year .
bildunterschrift : under soviet rule , the communist regime suppressed religion and marginalized christmas , instead focusing on the new year as the main holiday of the year .
after the fall of communism , christian celebrations and the christian orthodox religion came back into favor , as many russians turned to the church and religion in the wake of political turmoil in the 1990s .
many russians are religious the deutsche welle poll found that just under a third of russians - 29 percent - consider themselves religious , with most of those saying they go to church on holidays like christmas .
three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .
bildunterschrift : according to the poll , many young people are religious , with just 16 percent of russians under the age of 29 saying they do not believe in god .
russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .
bildunterschrift : but according to the deutsche welle poll , many russians would support a closer relationship between the two churches .
almost half of those polled are in favor of a meeting between the pope benedict xvi and kyrill i. forty percent say they are neutral on this issue .
a small minority of just 2 percent are opposed to such a meeting .
the ifak institute surveyed 1,000 russians in december 2010 .
the margin of error is no more than 3 percent .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one group says the genetic variety of wild crops could help adapt them to the future . domesticated varieties of rice , wheat , maize and potatoes make up much of the world 's food crops and are bred to thrive under certain conditions . however , some experts warn that these crops could become vulnerable to global warming as optimal conditions change across the planet . climate change is expected to have multiple impacts on agricultural productivity , especially in areas of the developing world that are already experiencing high levels of food insecurity . for example , in southern africa , the yields for maize , a vital crop in a region already suffering from chronic hunger , are predicted to fall by up to 30 percent within just 20 years . a growing population will put added pressure on the food supply .
the world 's population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 , which will require an estimated 70 percent increase in global agricultural production , according to the united nation 's food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- . making use of the genetic variety contained in wild crops – the ancestors of today 's food crops – could help secure the world 's food supply by helping modern crops adapt to climate change , according to the global crop diversity trust . tough ancestors for a harsh climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild seeds have the traits needed to deal with climate change , fowler said in partnership with the millennium seed bank of the royal botanic gardens at kew , england , the consultative group on international agricultural research , and $ 50 million -lrb- 38 million euros -rrb- of funding from the government of norway , the trust has launched a campaign to collect , save and utilize these wild plants . the wild ancestors of today 's food crops were typically very tough and able to grow in conditions that are hostile for today 's agriculture , according to cary fowler , executive director of the global crop diversity trust . " some of them are extremely heat resistant or drought tolerant , " he said .
" if you look forward and consider the kind of projections being made in terms of climate change , these are exactly the kind of qualities agricultural crops will need in the near future . " biodiversity : a life-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding the right wild relative makes crops more robust new climates will affect agriculture within the next 50 years , fowler said . plants will have to adapt to variable temperatures , droughts , floods or different pests and diseases .
he pointed to rice as an example of where wild crop varieties could benefit modern crops . at a critical stage in the flowering process for rice , even a one-degree rise in temperature could cut yields by 10 percent . most high-yield varieties of rice flower during the heat of the day and a few degrees temperature change could cut yields by up to 40 percent , fowler said . but some wild rice relatives flower at night and if that characteristic could be incorporated into farmed rice it could save millions of tons of rice " and thousands of lives , " said fowler . the wild relatives of today 's food crops make up only a tiny fraction of the seeds currently held in the world 's gene banks . although plant breeders have incorporated many traits from the wild versions of crops in the past , the resulting plants have never been comprehensively collected or conserved , according to the global crop diversity trust . many are in danger because of climate change or rapid habitat loss .
the royal botanic gardens , kew , estimated that a fifth of the world 's plants are threatened with extinction . " diversity equals resilience in the biological world , which is why this project is vital to the survival of agriculture , " said paul smith , director of kew 's millennium seed bank . wild plants : a good investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maize is another crop that could suffer under climate change wild crop forms annually contribute more than $ 100 billion to commercial agriculture , according to fowler 's estimates . one example cited by the global crop diversity trust of how a " wild relative " can save a modern crop goes back to the 1970s , when rice harvests across asia were hit by an outbreak of grassy stunt virus . scientists screened more than 10,000 samples of wild and locally cultivated rice plants for resistance to the disease and found it in a wild relative , oryza nivara , growing in india .
the gene has been incorporated into most new varieties since that discovery . norwegian minister of the environment and international development erik solheim said the project represented " one of the most concrete steps taken to date to ensure that agriculture and humanity , adapts to climate change .
at a more fundamental level , the project also demonstrates the importance of biodiversity and genetic resources for human survival . " solheim added that the scandinavian country , which provided the trust 's initial funding , is committed to conserving the world 's plant biodiversity and built the svalbard global seed vault on the arctic island of spitsbergen in 2008 , to store seed samples safely for posterity . a race against time bildunterschrift : it can take 10 years until new seeds are available the international campaign will involve research centers , agricultural institutes , botanical gardens and local people around the globe , who will search out the plants and collect them . the project is focusing on 23 crops considered to be the most important food crops , including rice , wheat , maize , potatoes , beans and peas .
the time scale is 10 years , as the wild plants collected can not be used directly in modern agriculture and because it takes seven to 10 years to breed a new crop variety . " you have to cross the plant with a domesticated form to see what characteristics it actually has : drought resistance , heat resistance during flowering good pest or disease resistance , " explained fowler .
" you ca n't plant the wild plants , farmers want domesticated , higher yield varieties and so somehow traits from these wild plants have to be used in the process of making new , more modern varieties . " the results will be entered into a database and made available to plant-breeders and any other interested parties around the globe . ultimately , the seeds will be used to produce crop varieties that can cope with climate change . the project is a race against time .
a rapidly rising population and increased demand for meat means global agriculture production will have to double in the next 50 years , said fowler , adding that if climate change continues in line with the most conservative estimates it would be difficult to keep up current agriculture output . he described climate change as the biggest challenge agriculture has faced in the last 12,000 years .
and the partners in the campaign believe the natural diversity in older varieties , the " wild relatives , " will be the most important tool in addressing the challenge of future food security . author : irene quaile , sean sinico editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he pointed to rice as an example of where wild crop varieties could benefit modern crops . at a critical stage in the flowering process for rice , even a one-degree rise in temperature could cut yields by 10 percent . most high-yield varieties of rice flower during the heat of the day and a few degrees temperature change could cut yields by up to 40 percent , fowler said . but some wild rice relatives flower at night and if that characteristic could be incorporated into farmed rice it could save millions of tons of rice " and thousands of lives , " said fowler . the wild relatives of today 's food crops make up only a tiny fraction of the seeds currently held in the world 's gene banks . although plant breeders have incorporated many traits from the wild versions of crops in the past , the resulting plants have never been comprehensively collected or conserved , according to the global crop diversity trust . many are in danger because of climate change or rapid habitat loss .
the royal botanic gardens , kew , estimated that a fifth of the world 's plants are threatened with extinction . " diversity equals resilience in the biological world , which is why this project is vital to the survival of agriculture , " said paul smith , director of kew 's millennium seed bank . wild plants : a good investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maize is another crop that could suffer under climate change wild crop forms annually contribute more than $ 100 billion to commercial agriculture , according to fowler 's estimates . one example cited by the global crop diversity trust of how a " wild relative " can save a modern crop goes back to the 1970s , when rice harvests across asia were hit by an outbreak of grassy stunt virus . scientists screened more than 10,000 samples of wild and locally cultivated rice plants for resistance to the disease and found it in a wild relative , oryza nivara , growing in india .
the gene has been incorporated into most new varieties since that discovery . norwegian minister of the environment and international development erik solheim said the project represented " one of the most concrete steps taken to date to ensure that agriculture and humanity , adapts to climate change .
at a more fundamental level , the project also demonstrates the importance of biodiversity and genetic resources for human survival . " solheim added that the scandinavian country , which provided the trust 's initial funding , is committed to conserving the world 's plant biodiversity and built the svalbard global seed vault on the arctic island of spitsbergen in 2008 , to store seed samples safely for posterity . a race against time bildunterschrift : it can take 10 years until new seeds are available the international campaign will involve research centers , agricultural institutes , botanical gardens and local people around the globe , who will search out the plants and collect them . the project is focusing on 23 crops considered to be the most important food crops , including rice , wheat , maize , potatoes , beans and peas .
the time scale is 10 years , as the wild plants collected can not be used directly in modern agriculture and because it takes seven to 10 years to breed a new crop variety . " you have to cross the plant with a domesticated form to see what characteristics it actually has : drought resistance , heat resistance during flowering good pest or disease resistance , " explained fowler .
" you ca n't plant the wild plants , farmers want domesticated , higher yield varieties and so somehow traits from these wild plants have to be used in the process of making new , more modern varieties . " the results will be entered into a database and made available to plant-breeders and any other interested parties around the globe . ultimately , the seeds will be used to produce crop varieties that can cope with climate change . the project is a race against time .
a rapidly rising population and increased demand for meat means global agriculture production will have to double in the next 50 years , said fowler , adding that if climate change continues in line with the most conservative estimates it would be difficult to keep up current agriculture output . he described climate change as the biggest challenge agriculture has faced in the last 12,000 years .

one group says the genetic variety of wild crops could help adapt them to the future . domesticated varieties of rice , wheat , maize and potatoes make up much of the world 's food crops and are bred to thrive under certain conditions . however , some experts warn that these crops could become vulnerable to global warming as optimal conditions change across the planet . climate change is expected to have multiple impacts on agricultural productivity , especially in areas of the developing world that are already experiencing high levels of food insecurity . for example , in southern africa , the yields for maize , a vital crop in a region already suffering from chronic hunger , are predicted to fall by up to 30 percent within just 20 years . a growing population will put added pressure on the food supply .
the world 's population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 , which will require an estimated 70 percent increase in global agricultural production , according to the united nation 's food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- . making use of the genetic variety contained in wild crops – the ancestors of today 's food crops – could help secure the world 's food supply by helping modern crops adapt to climate change , according to the global crop diversity trust . tough ancestors for a harsh climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild seeds have the traits needed to deal with climate change , fowler said in partnership with the millennium seed bank of the royal botanic gardens at kew , england , the consultative group on international agricultural research , and $ 50 million -lrb- 38 million euros -rrb- of funding from the government of norway , the trust has launched a campaign to collect , save and utilize these wild plants . the wild ancestors of today 's food crops were typically very tough and able to grow in conditions that are hostile for today 's agriculture , according to cary fowler , executive director of the global crop diversity trust .

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush .

deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .
however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .

in europe , more than 100 million people speak german .
deutsche welle offers a flexible and interactive way to learn german – with an introduction to courses in 30 languages . germany ’ s international broadcaster reaches out to people all over the world – with online , television and radio programming – with the goal of creating a bridge between cultures .
listeners , viewers and users have always been interested in learning more about the german language and culture .
deutsche welle offers something special – journalistic content and a virtual classroom all in one .
reading , seeing and understanding are linked with video and audio content as well as texts and articles .
but it ’ s not just a digital book – those learning german have access to much more , like the chance to improve their skills with the crime team from “ mission europe ” .
and there is a wide range of podcasts for those who want to learn on the go .
the soap opera “ jojo sucht das glück ” has been online since july 2010 .
dw is hoping that the new format will especially get the younger generation excited about learning german .
this expansive platform was developed by deutsche welle with individual learners in mind and with the help of outstanding partners like the goethe-institut , radio france internationale , polskie radio , the german chambers of industry and commerce and inwent .
the number of users shows just how popular these language-learning tools are – especially the slowly-spoken news that offers a way to learn german while listening to the latest from culture , business and politics .
the instructional features from “ video-thema ” , the “ top-thema ” with vocabulary and “ radio d ” have all established themselves among language learners , as well “ deutsch interaktiv ” , “ deutsch – warum nicht ? ” , “ wieso nicht ? ” and “ marktplatz ” with german for the business world .
there are also three newsletters , including one for german teachers .
at www.dw-world.de , users from around the world can also learn about dialects , idioms and the german way of life .
the “ dialektatlas ” and “ deutsch mobil ” are just two more stations on the interactive language journey .
in addition to its language courses , deutsche welle fosters the german language with excellent initiatives – like with its latest project “ sprache von welt ? – streiten über deutsch ” -lrb- world language – quarreling about german -rrb- .
representatives from culture , science , politics and media , german teachers and german students highlight different aspects of the relevance of the german language in the future .
articles , essays and interviews from and with people from germany and around the world describe the different positions .
the project is made up of an online series that will be included in a printed brochure in the future , as well as a series of events and a special edition of dw ’ s “ weltzeit ” magazine .

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .

however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is the first chinese citizen to ever receive a nobel prize " even though they are focusing their attention on modern china more and more , a chinese citizen gets a nobel prize for the first time , and they say almost nothing , " he said .
" that ’ s strange and the question is why ? "
some german sinologists depend on beijing in a recent article in the sueddeutsche zeitung , strittmatter argued that german sinologists had stayed mum because their jobs were partly dependent on the chinese government .
he pointed out that two professorships at goettingen university were sponsored by beijing .
meanwhile , jörg-meinhard rudolph from the university of applied sciences in ludwigshafen said that that some german sinologists feared future research projects could be jeopardized if they were to displease the chinese authorities .
" they are interested in doing research in china .
chinese academics can conduct research independently in germany , " he explained .
" but foreign , german or european academics in china can not work alone .
they need so-called partners . "
influence of confucius institutes the connection between the chinese departments of german universities and confucius institutes has also come under scrutiny .
there are 11 confucius institutes located in german universities .
these establishments are the chinese equivalent of the goethe institute or british council , promoting chinese culture and language abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many see the confucius institutes as a chinese soft-power tool many of the staff employed to teach chinese language courses are financed by beijing .
some critics say that china has thus been influencing the direction of chinese studies in germany .
political minefield for german sinologist susanne weigelin-schwiedrzik , who is the head of vienna university ’ s chinese department , " every single scholar has to make his or her position very clear because this is a highly-sensitive political minefield . "
" the best thing to do is keep a distance .
i work with chinese academics but i always make it clear to them that my research is not dependent on them , " she said .
although she also acknowledged that freedom of speech included a scholar ’ s right to remain silent on certain issues , but also thought academics do bear some responsibility as public figures .
" i am of the opinion that i am morally obliged - as someone who is open and has a view of the world and as a european intellectual - to observe and analyze the world , from beyond my academic sphere . " after all the public criticism in the media , it will be interesting to see whether more german china experts remember this the next time a chinese dissident is awarded a prize .

blocked freeways have cut off supply lines for car manufacturers , gas stations and delivery companies . in snow-covered germany , trying to get around on streets that have n't been salted is next to impossible , and road salt company k + s is benefitting from the increase in demand .
their stock on the german exchange dax has risen significantly in the last few days .
in other branches of the economy , however , the hard winter is turning into a serious problem .
" production in the german construction industry is at a standstill , " said heiko stiepelmann from a building industry group .
excavation , road works , and building construction have especially taken a hit . "
the construction industry is facing its second battle with winter weather in 2010 .
in the first three months of the year the sector was faced with similar problems of snow and ice .
" if it repeats itself at the end of the year , we 'll hardly be able to record a profit , " said stiepelmann .
economy remains thawed the construction industry is n't alone in feeling the sting of the cold and snowy weather .
companies are postponing business trips .
restaurants and stores are suffering as customers find it difficult to get around .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer shoppers are braving the weather " the harsh and early winter is stunting economic growth at the end of the year , " said volker treier , lead economist of the german chamber of commerce .
last winter cost economic growth a half percentage point , and treier says this winter is pushing things in a similar direction .
" but the general economic boom is too strong to be held back by a hard winter , " he added .
car problems the ford car factory in cologne was another victim of the winter conditions .
production was stopped last week because a delivery of heaters could n't be made on time .
" the heaters are from a factory in northern france , but france and belgium closed the freeways for semi-trucks that weighed more than seven and a half tons , " said bernd meier , ford 's press officer at the factory in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many deliveries did n't even make it to the freeway the opel factory in bochum faced shortages of certain car parts , but the finished cars could still be completed on time .
blocked or closed highways have limited deliveries of fuel to gas stations , leading to a shortage in some parts of germany .
the oil company esso reported that 20 german gas stations were completely out of gas .
icy roads kept fuel trucks from leaving at shell oil refineries .
race against the clock the timing of this particular cold snap is especially problematic for logistics companies hoping to deliver christmas presents on time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting gifts delivered on time could be a challenge christine hoeger , a spokeswoman for the online shopping portal amazon , said delivery of packages could be delayed by up to two days .
dhl was a little more optimistic for its christmas deliveries .
" we 're assuming that we can deliver all packages that reach us by midday on december 22 on time for christmas , " said claus korfmacher , a dhl spokesman in bonn .
despite the guarantee , getting presents under the christmas tree on time this year in germany could prove to be a challenge .

the main studio for germany ’ s international television service is located on the voltastrasse in berlin .
dw-tv presents informational television that is available via a global satellite network 24 hours a day – in german and english , spanish in america and arabic for viewers from morocco to saudi arabia .
in 2009 , deutsche welle began broadcasting two new channels to viewers in asia and australia – one with a focus on english-language programming and one with a focus on german .
with these two channels deutsche welle was able to meet the viewers ’ requests as well as the wants and needs of partner stations throughout the region .
for viewers in the arab world , dw-tv is broadcast around the clock , switching between arabic and english .
this regionalized channel was launched in 2002 and can be viewed in more than 20 arabic countries via the nilesat satellite .
it is also broadcast via hotbird fro viewers in europe .
creating regional programming options is part of deutsche welle ’ s long-term strategy – it increases the acceptance of the broadcaster internationally .
increased cooperation with the german broadcasters ard and zdf will bring about substantial expansion and enhancement of dw-tv programming , following the signing of an agreement at the end of 2006 .
new programs for latin america and the united states are already on air .
the cooperation was further developed in april 2008 .
now , dw-tv is using more content from ard and zdf , especially to complement shows like talking germany and germany today as well as global 3000 and in good shape .
dw-tv viewers in asia and australia also benefit from this cooperation . magazines , reports and documentaries journal , the half-hour news magazine , is the flagship for germany ’ s international broadcaster : every hour , in english , german , spanish and arabic .

spanish was added as a third language .
since 1995 , dw-tv has been broadcasting around the clock .
programming content and structure has been adapted and updated a number of times – a process that has always been guided by an efficient overall concept of the way germany ’ s media image is presented to the outside world .
the most radical change was dw-tv ’ s repositioning as of january 1 , 1999 .
since then , dw-tv has focused on news and information , with an additional spotlight on the arts and culture in general .
deutsche welle ’ s experience with global television goes back to 1963 .
that was when dw , then based in cologne , sent a foreign-language adaptation of a german film beyond germany ’ s borders for the first time .
the company transtel -lrb- today known as dw-transtel -rrb- was founded to transcribe and distribute german tv productions .
as one of the shareholders , dw took charge of the selection and adaptation of the programs , as well as the acquisition of foreign rights .
from 1983 , dw began producing television programs on its own .
in 1998 , transtel was closed down and its tasks were fully integrated into dw but the brand dw-transtel remained .
in this way , hundreds of hours of programming continue to go out to the world every year in many languages .
programs are adapted in and dispatched from berlin . september 2010 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are the demonstrations peaceful or is there a violent revolution taking place ?
the worldwide competition for opinions is about terms , their meaning and the constant presence in the media .
the number of national and international information providers keeps growing .
arabic , chinese or russian broadcasters have broken through the west ’ s former dominance and are providing another perspective to the world .
what some may call a fairly-won election , others call a fraud .
in the battle to win opinions and the struggle of interpretive predominance , deutsche welle presents the german perspective on worldwide events .
how is the worldwide financial crisis , the middle east conflict and the fight for a european constitution discussed in germany ?
how does the country work ?
its democracy , its rule of law , its social market economy ?
this is what deutsche welle delivers – smart , up-to-date and with all the necessary background information .
it stands behind independent journalism as that is the only way to ensure credibility .
from “ détente ” to intercultural dialogue when deutsche welle was first launched on may 3 , 1953 , the then german president theodor heuss said the task of germany ’ s international radio was to promote “ détente ” .
now , 60 years after the founding of the federal republic of germany and 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall and the east-west conflict , “ détente ” has given way to intercultural dialogue .
over the years , deutsche welle gained a reputation as “ the voice of freedom ” – from the 1968 “ prague spring ” and the era of dictatorship in greece to the wars in the balkans and in chechnya to the current trouble spots in afghanistan and iraq .
this is now being replaced by its growing standing as the “ voice of human rights ” . working with multimedia radio programming and online content is available in 30 languages : albanian , amharic , arabic , bengali , bulgarian , bosnian , chinese , croatian , dari , english , farsi , french , german , greek , hausa , hindi , indonesian , kiswahili , macedonian , pashtu , polish , portuguese -lrb- for africa and brazil -rrb- , romanian , russian , serbian , spanish , turkish , ukrainian and urdu .
in the course of digitalization and media convergence , deutsche welle began merging the radio and online departments in 2008 to create one multimedia team for each language .
the broadcasting center in bonn thus hosts many editorial teams that produce content for radio as well as for the multimedia website www.dw-world.de.
the internet is an interactive medium and plays an important role when it comes to intercultural dialogue .
communication is two-way and the user ’ s opinion is in demand – via e-mail , in forums or surveys .
there is also a wide variety of newsletters available free of charge .
deutsche welle is one of the leaders on the internet when it comes to audio and video content .
programming from dw-tv and dw-radio is available around the clock as a live stream or in the online archive .
even older programs are accessible .
deutsche welle was the first german broadcaster to utilize podcasting – downloadable audio and video content also available on a subscription basis .
now there are more than 50 programs in several different languages to download .
users can also access a large percentage of content in all 30 languages from their mobile devices by going to http : / / mobile.dw-world.de.

the full range of courses and learning materials can be found online at www.dw-world.de / germancourses .
promoting the german language is also part of deutsche welle ’ s mission .
the bobs : the best international weblogs from text and pictures to video and audio content , users around the world are producing their own content under the general term web 2.0 – often with a radical view of the world they live in .
especially in countries where freedom of the press is limited , like iran , china and cuba , blogs are one of the few ways for people to express themselves freely .
deutsche welle created the bobs blog award in 2004 , giving a unique overview of the international weblog scene in 11 languages : arabic , bengali , chinese , english , farsi , french , german , indonesian , portuguese , russian and spanish .

many of the course participants from developing countries who were trained at the academy now hold high positions in their countries – and are spokespeople for germany .
for deutsche welle director general erik bettermann , this is a sign “ that our training measures have made a profound contribution to the development of democratic structures in the target countries . ” decades of experience the dw radio training center was founded in cologne in 1965 as part of germany ’ s support program for media in africa , asia and latin america .
the television training center originated – with the same objectives – in the agreement made in 1970 between the federal ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- and sender freies berlin -lrb- sfb -rrb- .
in 1996 , it was integrated into deutsche welle , operating at dw-tv ’ s headquarters in the german capital .
the centers are primarily funded through the bmz .

courses are held abroad with a few in germany as well .
since the planning and implementation of all training are always based on concrete requests , the important principle of participation is not only maintained , but enhanced by efforts to increase the input of partners around the world .
whenever possible , synergies are created through cooperation , for example , with german political foundations and the goethe institute .
dw has also forged close alliances with radio stations and training centers in the countries where courses are held .
deutsche welle ’ s academy is in contact with more than 300 governmental , public and independent broadcasting stations in 130 countries .
the aim of all of the seminars and workshops is to enhance the professional skills of the participants .
other important aspects include ethics in journalism , as well as freedom of opinion and freedom of press . master ’ s program : international media studies deutsche welle has created a master ’ s program entitled “ international media studies ” in cooperation with the university of bonn and the bonn rhein-sieg university of applied sciences .
another partner in the project is the international education and development organization inwent .
since fall of 2009 , the first 22 students from 13 countries have been working on the two-year course of study .
it focuses on journalism , media management , communications and media studies .
the further education program is designed for future journalists and media managers from developing countries .
the academy also offers a media-related , intercultural communi ¬ cation training program for german executives who are being sent abroad .
in addition to learning about the respective national cultures , participants are also taught how to deal with specific media in their host country .
deutsche welle trains young journalists every year .
its multimedia training program is highly respected by other german media institutions and spots are sought-after .
training is made especially available to young journalists from the broadcast regions to work in the foreign-language services . www.dw-akademie.de september 2010 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 05 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .
however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that could be the job ad posted every year in the search for santas .
across germany , companies turn to students to stick on beards and spread the holiday spirit . " do you have a moment ? "
santa asks a shopper in a busy store in the western germany city of bonn .
in the days before christmas , even santa has to ask politely .
after all , christmas time is shopping time .
but for santa , with his goody-filled sack , most people are happy to pause a moment . resplendent in his red velvet trousers and jacket , heavy black boots and , of course , the warm santa claus hat , christoph chapman has spent three hours at work this afternoon , in a large department store in downtown bonn . " the costume is very itchy , especially the beard , " he admitted . only the tall and round need apply normally , chapman studies political science and history in bonn .
but today he is santa claus .
he makes his way throughout the store , handing out apples , chocolate and stuffed animals to children and parents .
in his wake is a palpable sense of relief from the pre-christmas stress , and that is why the job is so fun , according to chapman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the student affairs association posts christmas jobs online chapman 's girlfriend found the job advertisement among the web pages of an online job site for bonn students .
the only requirements were a friendly attitude and certain santa claus-esque attributes . " actually , i still needed a big belly , but my girlfriend would n't have liked that , " chapman said , laughing . high demand positions as early as october businesses and families started looking for students to fill positions surrounding the holiday season .
santas and angels are in particularly high demand for company events , marketing campaigns or the giving of gifts on christmas eve .
also sought after are christmas tree vendors and employees to man the stalls for the many christmas markets . " these are well-paid jobs for which you need no special skills , " said mirjam von der mark , a marketing manager at studentenwerk bonn , a student services association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other jobs during the season are to be found at the christmas market in berlin the work placement of santa and his helpers by studentenwerk has been around since 1949 .
last year alone students made up the 500 santas and 50 angels who brought gifts to families in berlin and brandenburg . in order to ensure the recruits can ho-ho-ho correctly , students in berlin can attend workshops on the fundamentals of santa claus and angels .
the official angels and santa claus guidelines recommend being , " child-loving , innovative , and reliable . " " it 's cold , but it 's fun ! " jennifer bohne , however , does n't need a workshop for her job .
the 23-year-old student works at the bonn christmas market .
for five weeks she 's been standing behind the counter selling toasted almonds and cashews in small bags . " it 's cold , but it 's fun , " bohne said , adding that next year she 'll definitely be back . but whoever wants one of these coveted christmas jobs has to be quick .
finding applicants for an inventory job can sometimes be a tough affair , marketing manager mirjam von der mark said .

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .
however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .

that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "

that could be the job ad posted every year in the search for santas .
across germany , companies turn to students to stick on beards and spread the holiday spirit . " do you have a moment ? "
santa asks a shopper in a busy store in the western germany city of bonn .
in the days before christmas , even santa has to ask politely .
after all , christmas time is shopping time .
but for santa , with his goody-filled sack , most people are happy to pause a moment . resplendent in his red velvet trousers and jacket , heavy black boots and , of course , the warm santa claus hat , christoph chapman has spent three hours at work this afternoon , in a large department store in downtown bonn . " the costume is very itchy , especially the beard , " he admitted . only the tall and round need apply normally , chapman studies political science and history in bonn .
but today he is santa claus .
he makes his way throughout the store , handing out apples , chocolate and stuffed animals to children and parents .
in his wake is a palpable sense of relief from the pre-christmas stress , and that is why the job is so fun , according to chapman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the student affairs association posts christmas jobs online chapman 's girlfriend found the job advertisement among the web pages of an online job site for bonn students .
the only requirements were a friendly attitude and certain santa claus-esque attributes . " actually , i still needed a big belly , but my girlfriend would n't have liked that , " chapman said , laughing . high demand positions as early as october businesses and families started looking for students to fill positions surrounding the holiday season .
santas and angels are in particularly high demand for company events , marketing campaigns or the giving of gifts on christmas eve .
also sought after are christmas tree vendors and employees to man the stalls for the many christmas markets . " these are well-paid jobs for which you need no special skills , " said mirjam von der mark , a marketing manager at studentenwerk bonn , a student services association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other jobs during the season are to be found at the christmas market in berlin the work placement of santa and his helpers by studentenwerk has been around since 1949 .
last year alone students made up the 500 santas and 50 angels who brought gifts to families in berlin and brandenburg . in order to ensure the recruits can ho-ho-ho correctly , students in berlin can attend workshops on the fundamentals of santa claus and angels .
the official angels and santa claus guidelines recommend being , " child-loving , innovative , and reliable . " " it 's cold , but it 's fun ! " jennifer bohne , however , does n't need a workshop for her job .
the 23-year-old student works at the bonn christmas market .
for five weeks she 's been standing behind the counter selling toasted almonds and cashews in small bags . " it 's cold , but it 's fun , " bohne said , adding that next year she 'll definitely be back . but whoever wants one of these coveted christmas jobs has to be quick .
finding applicants for an inventory job can sometimes be a tough affair , marketing manager mirjam von der mark said .
but she said the jobs disappear faster than fresh-baked christmas cookies . " as soon as the ad is online , my phone rings off the hook , " she said . author : svenja ueing -lrb- sjt -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .
however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that could be the job ad posted every year in the search for santas .
across germany , companies turn to students to stick on beards and spread the holiday spirit . " do you have a moment ? "
santa asks a shopper in a busy store in the western germany city of bonn .
in the days before christmas , even santa has to ask politely .
after all , christmas time is shopping time .
but for santa , with his goody-filled sack , most people are happy to pause a moment . resplendent in his red velvet trousers and jacket , heavy black boots and , of course , the warm santa claus hat , christoph chapman has spent three hours at work this afternoon , in a large department store in downtown bonn . " the costume is very itchy , especially the beard , " he admitted . only the tall and round need apply normally , chapman studies political science and history in bonn .
but today he is santa claus .
he makes his way throughout the store , handing out apples , chocolate and stuffed animals to children and parents .
in his wake is a palpable sense of relief from the pre-christmas stress , and that is why the job is so fun , according to chapman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the student affairs association posts christmas jobs online chapman 's girlfriend found the job advertisement among the web pages of an online job site for bonn students .
the only requirements were a friendly attitude and certain santa claus-esque attributes . " actually , i still needed a big belly , but my girlfriend would n't have liked that , " chapman said , laughing . high demand positions as early as october businesses and families started looking for students to fill positions surrounding the holiday season .
santas and angels are in particularly high demand for company events , marketing campaigns or the giving of gifts on christmas eve .
also sought after are christmas tree vendors and employees to man the stalls for the many christmas markets . " these are well-paid jobs for which you need no special skills , " said mirjam von der mark , a marketing manager at studentenwerk bonn , a student services association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other jobs during the season are to be found at the christmas market in berlin the work placement of santa and his helpers by studentenwerk has been around since 1949 .
last year alone students made up the 500 santas and 50 angels who brought gifts to families in berlin and brandenburg . in order to ensure the recruits can ho-ho-ho correctly , students in berlin can attend workshops on the fundamentals of santa claus and angels .
the official angels and santa claus guidelines recommend being , " child-loving , innovative , and reliable . " " it 's cold , but it 's fun ! " jennifer bohne , however , does n't need a workshop for her job .
the 23-year-old student works at the bonn christmas market .
for five weeks she 's been standing behind the counter selling toasted almonds and cashews in small bags . " it 's cold , but it 's fun , " bohne said , adding that next year she 'll definitely be back . but whoever wants one of these coveted christmas jobs has to be quick .
finding applicants for an inventory job can sometimes be a tough affair , marketing manager mirjam von der mark said .
but she said the jobs disappear faster than fresh-baked christmas cookies .

schalke 's win caps an impressive recent run , and prompted coach felix magath to grant his players more time off over christmas . schalke won their last match of 2010 , beating german second division leaders augsburg 1-0 in the german cup .
the victory secured the royal blues a place in the quarter-finals , and it also earned them a longer christmas holiday .
last month coach felix magath , angered by his club 's dreadful start to the season , had curtailed the players ' vacation time , ordering them back to training on december 27 .
" i 'm very satisfied , and that 's why we 'll all have a break until january 2 , " magath told reporters after the match in augsburg .
" i 'm satisfied with my team 's performance .
it was a tough task , especially considering the condition of the pitch . "
in all competitions , schalke have now won five consecutive games .
after weeks in the relegation zone , they are up to a solid 10th in the bundesliga , and they 're through to the knockout stages of the lucrative champions ' league .
tuesday 's win on a snow-covered augsburg pitch was by no means easy , and it took schalke 84 minutes to find the decisive goal .
veteran spanish striker raul , who has been the personification of schalke 's ice-cold turned red-hot season so far , did the hard work - taking on three defenders and then putting peruvian winger jefferson farfan through to score from the right flank .
hoffenheim pile more misery on moenchengladbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a good day for all the bundesliga 's boys in blue matches pitting offenbach against nuremberg and koblenz against kaiserslautern were both canceled due to bad weather conditions on tuesday , but in the second fixture that did go ahead , hoffenheim beat visitors borussia moenchengladbach 2-0 .
icelandic midfielder gylfi sigurdsson opened the scoring for hoffenheim with a trademark free-kick from just outside the area , but a lot of credit for the goal must go to moenchengladbach keeper christofer heimeroth .
instead of shooting over the wall , sigurdsson elected to try his luck on heimeroth 's side of the goal , but as he struck it the gladbach keeper dived away from his station towards the other side of the net in a spectacularly misguided gamble .
senegalese forward demba ba scored hoffenheim 's second on 63 minutes , a short range finish from a sejad salihovic corner that three gladbach defenders failed to clear .
as well as securing them a spot in the last eight , the win broke a run of four consecutive draws for hoffenheim , who have slipped back into mid-table in recent weeks after a very strong start to the season .
for gladbach , however , the result completes a rather miserable run leading up to the christmas holidays .
as well as dropping out of the german cup with this defeat , moenchengladbach go into the winter break rock bottom of the bundesliga , having also lost five consecutive league matches .
in wednesday 's german cup games - weather permitting - wolfsburg entertain cottbus , duisburg travel to cologne , aachen play host to frankfurt , and stuttgart face a tough home test against bayern munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.12.2010 critics question lidl 's call for 10-euro minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl pays its employees at least 10 euros an hour lidl has surprised germany by calling for a 10-euro -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- minimum hourly wage for retail workers – that 's higher than the level being demanded by trade unions .
critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .
however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .

" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.12.2010 critics question lidl 's call for 10-euro minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl pays its employees at least 10 euros an hour lidl has surprised germany by calling for a 10-euro -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- minimum hourly wage for retail workers – that 's higher than the level being demanded by trade unions .
critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said .

that could be the job ad posted every year in the search for santas .
across germany , companies turn to students to stick on beards and spread the holiday spirit . " do you have a moment ? "
santa asks a shopper in a busy store in the western germany city of bonn .
in the days before christmas , even santa has to ask politely .
after all , christmas time is shopping time .
but for santa , with his goody-filled sack , most people are happy to pause a moment . resplendent in his red velvet trousers and jacket , heavy black boots and , of course , the warm santa claus hat , christoph chapman has spent three hours at work this afternoon , in a large department store in downtown bonn . " the costume is very itchy , especially the beard , " he admitted . only the tall and round need apply normally , chapman studies political science and history in bonn .
but today he is santa claus .
he makes his way throughout the store , handing out apples , chocolate and stuffed animals to children and parents .
in his wake is a palpable sense of relief from the pre-christmas stress , and that is why the job is so fun , according to chapman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the student affairs association posts christmas jobs online chapman 's girlfriend found the job advertisement among the web pages of an online job site for bonn students .
the only requirements were a friendly attitude and certain santa claus-esque attributes . " actually , i still needed a big belly , but my girlfriend would n't have liked that , " chapman said , laughing . high demand positions as early as october businesses and families started looking for students to fill positions surrounding the holiday season .
santas and angels are in particularly high demand for company events , marketing campaigns or the giving of gifts on christmas eve .
also sought after are christmas tree vendors and employees to man the stalls for the many christmas markets . " these are well-paid jobs for which you need no special skills , " said mirjam von der mark , a marketing manager at studentenwerk bonn , a student services association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other jobs during the season are to be found at the christmas market in berlin the work placement of santa and his helpers by studentenwerk has been around since 1949 .
last year alone students made up the 500 santas and 50 angels who brought gifts to families in berlin and brandenburg . in order to ensure the recruits can ho-ho-ho correctly , students in berlin can attend workshops on the fundamentals of santa claus and angels .
the official angels and santa claus guidelines recommend being , " child-loving , innovative , and reliable . " " it 's cold , but it 's fun ! " jennifer bohne , however , does n't need a workshop for her job .
the 23-year-old student works at the bonn christmas market .
for five weeks she 's been standing behind the counter selling toasted almonds and cashews in small bags . " it 's cold , but it 's fun , " bohne said , adding that next year she 'll definitely be back . but whoever wants one of these coveted christmas jobs has to be quick .
finding applicants for an inventory job can sometimes be a tough affair , marketing manager mirjam von der mark said .
but she said the jobs disappear faster than fresh-baked christmas cookies .

a majority of 64 percent say they celebrate christmas alongside other important occasions .
nineteen percent regard christmas as the most significant holiday of the year .
bildunterschrift : under soviet rule , the communist regime suppressed religion and marginalized christmas , instead focusing on the new year as the main holiday of the year .
after the fall of communism , christian celebrations and the christian orthodox religion came back into favor , as many russians turned to the church and religion in the wake of political turmoil in the 1990s .
many russians are religious the deutsche welle poll found that just under a third of russians - 29 percent - consider themselves religious , with most of those saying they go to church on holidays like christmas .
three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .
bildunterschrift : according to the poll , many young people are religious , with just 16 percent of russians under the age of 29 saying they do not believe in god .
russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .
bildunterschrift : but according to the deutsche welle poll , many russians would support a closer relationship between the two churches .

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .

blocked freeways have cut off supply lines for car manufacturers , gas stations and delivery companies . in snow-covered germany , trying to get around on streets that have n't been salted is next to impossible , and road salt company k + s is benefitting from the increase in demand .
their stock on the german exchange dax has risen significantly in the last few days .
in other branches of the economy , however , the hard winter is turning into a serious problem .
" production in the german construction industry is at a standstill , " said heiko stiepelmann from a building industry group .
excavation , road works , and building construction have especially taken a hit . "
the construction industry is facing its second battle with winter weather in 2010 .
in the first three months of the year the sector was faced with similar problems of snow and ice .
" if it repeats itself at the end of the year , we 'll hardly be able to record a profit , " said stiepelmann .
economy remains thawed the construction industry is n't alone in feeling the sting of the cold and snowy weather .
companies are postponing business trips .
restaurants and stores are suffering as customers find it difficult to get around .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer shoppers are braving the weather " the harsh and early winter is stunting economic growth at the end of the year , " said volker treier , lead economist of the german chamber of commerce .
last winter cost economic growth a half percentage point , and treier says this winter is pushing things in a similar direction .
" but the general economic boom is too strong to be held back by a hard winter , " he added .
car problems the ford car factory in cologne was another victim of the winter conditions .
production was stopped last week because a delivery of heaters could n't be made on time .
" the heaters are from a factory in northern france , but france and belgium closed the freeways for semi-trucks that weighed more than seven and a half tons , " said bernd meier , ford 's press officer at the factory in cologne .

the oil company esso reported that 20 german gas stations were completely out of gas .
icy roads kept fuel trucks from leaving at shell oil refineries .
race against the clock the timing of this particular cold snap is especially problematic for logistics companies hoping to deliver christmas presents on time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting gifts delivered on time could be a challenge christine hoeger , a spokeswoman for the online shopping portal amazon , said delivery of packages could be delayed by up to two days .
dhl was a little more optimistic for its christmas deliveries .
" we 're assuming that we can deliver all packages that reach us by midday on december 22 on time for christmas , " said claus korfmacher , a dhl spokesman in bonn .
despite the guarantee , getting presents under the christmas tree on time this year in germany could prove to be a challenge .

but now a german daily has claimed that the majority of german sinologists kowtow to china . many countries defied chinese diplomatic pressure earlier this month , by sending an envoy to the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo for the chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
many western intellectuals applauded when liu , who is serving an 11-year jail term , was proclaimed this year ’ s nobel peace laureate .
politicians from all over the world demanded his immediate release .
but journalist and china expert kai strittmatter said there was a conspicuous silence among germany ’ s sinologists .
bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is the first chinese citizen to ever receive a nobel prize " even though they are focusing their attention on modern china more and more , a chinese citizen gets a nobel prize for the first time , and they say almost nothing , " he said .
" that ’ s strange and the question is why ? "
some german sinologists depend on beijing in a recent article in the sueddeutsche zeitung , strittmatter argued that german sinologists had stayed mum because their jobs were partly dependent on the chinese government .
he pointed out that two professorships at goettingen university were sponsored by beijing .
meanwhile , jörg-meinhard rudolph from the university of applied sciences in ludwigshafen said that that some german sinologists feared future research projects could be jeopardized if they were to displease the chinese authorities .
" they are interested in doing research in china .
chinese academics can conduct research independently in germany , " he explained .
" but foreign , german or european academics in china can not work alone .
they need so-called partners . "
influence of confucius institutes the connection between the chinese departments of german universities and confucius institutes has also come under scrutiny .
there are 11 confucius institutes located in german universities .
these establishments are the chinese equivalent of the goethe institute or british council , promoting chinese culture and language abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many see the confucius institutes as a chinese soft-power tool many of the staff employed to teach chinese language courses are financed by beijing .
some critics say that china has thus been influencing the direction of chinese studies in germany .
political minefield for german sinologist susanne weigelin-schwiedrzik , who is the head of vienna university ’ s chinese department , " every single scholar has to make his or her position very clear because this is a highly-sensitive political minefield . "
" the best thing to do is keep a distance .
i work with chinese academics but i always make it clear to them that my research is not dependent on them , " she said .
although she also acknowledged that freedom of speech included a scholar ’ s right to remain silent on certain issues , but also thought academics do bear some responsibility as public figures .
" i am of the opinion that i am morally obliged - as someone who is open and has a view of the world and as a european intellectual - to observe and analyze the world , from beyond my academic sphere . " after all the public criticism in the media , it will be interesting to see whether more german china experts remember this the next time a chinese dissident is awarded a prize .

blocked freeways have cut off supply lines for car manufacturers , gas stations and delivery companies . in snow-covered germany , trying to get around on streets that have n't been salted is next to impossible , and road salt company k + s is benefitting from the increase in demand .
their stock on the german exchange dax has risen significantly in the last few days .
in other branches of the economy , however , the hard winter is turning into a serious problem .
" production in the german construction industry is at a standstill , " said heiko stiepelmann from a building industry group .
excavation , road works , and building construction have especially taken a hit . "
the construction industry is facing its second battle with winter weather in 2010 .
in the first three months of the year the sector was faced with similar problems of snow and ice .
" if it repeats itself at the end of the year , we 'll hardly be able to record a profit , " said stiepelmann .
economy remains thawed the construction industry is n't alone in feeling the sting of the cold and snowy weather .
companies are postponing business trips .
restaurants and stores are suffering as customers find it difficult to get around .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer shoppers are braving the weather " the harsh and early winter is stunting economic growth at the end of the year , " said volker treier , lead economist of the german chamber of commerce .
last winter cost economic growth a half percentage point , and treier says this winter is pushing things in a similar direction .
" but the general economic boom is too strong to be held back by a hard winter , " he added .
car problems the ford car factory in cologne was another victim of the winter conditions .
production was stopped last week because a delivery of heaters could n't be made on time .
" the heaters are from a factory in northern france , but france and belgium closed the freeways for semi-trucks that weighed more than seven and a half tons , " said bernd meier , ford 's press officer at the factory in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many deliveries did n't even make it to the freeway the opel factory in bochum faced shortages of certain car parts , but the finished cars could still be completed on time .
blocked or closed highways have limited deliveries of fuel to gas stations , leading to a shortage in some parts of germany .
the oil company esso reported that 20 german gas stations were completely out of gas .
icy roads kept fuel trucks from leaving at shell oil refineries .
race against the clock the timing of this particular cold snap is especially problematic for logistics companies hoping to deliver christmas presents on time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting gifts delivered on time could be a challenge christine hoeger , a spokeswoman for the online shopping portal amazon , said delivery of packages could be delayed by up to two days .
dhl was a little more optimistic for its christmas deliveries .
" we 're assuming that we can deliver all packages that reach us by midday on december 22 on time for christmas , " said claus korfmacher , a dhl spokesman in bonn .
despite the guarantee , getting presents under the christmas tree on time this year in germany could prove to be a challenge .

blocked freeways have cut off supply lines for car manufacturers , gas stations and delivery companies . in snow-covered germany , trying to get around on streets that have n't been salted is next to impossible , and road salt company k + s is benefitting from the increase in demand .
their stock on the german exchange dax has risen significantly in the last few days .
in other branches of the economy , however , the hard winter is turning into a serious problem .
" production in the german construction industry is at a standstill , " said heiko stiepelmann from a building industry group .
excavation , road works , and building construction have especially taken a hit . "
the construction industry is facing its second battle with winter weather in 2010 .
in the first three months of the year the sector was faced with similar problems of snow and ice .
" if it repeats itself at the end of the year , we 'll hardly be able to record a profit , " said stiepelmann .
economy remains thawed the construction industry is n't alone in feeling the sting of the cold and snowy weather .
companies are postponing business trips .
restaurants and stores are suffering as customers find it difficult to get around .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer shoppers are braving the weather " the harsh and early winter is stunting economic growth at the end of the year , " said volker treier , lead economist of the german chamber of commerce .
last winter cost economic growth a half percentage point , and treier says this winter is pushing things in a similar direction .
" but the general economic boom is too strong to be held back by a hard winter , " he added .
car problems the ford car factory in cologne was another victim of the winter conditions .
production was stopped last week because a delivery of heaters could n't be made on time .
" the heaters are from a factory in northern france , but france and belgium closed the freeways for semi-trucks that weighed more than seven and a half tons , " said bernd meier , ford 's press officer at the factory in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many deliveries did n't even make it to the freeway the opel factory in bochum faced shortages of certain car parts , but the finished cars could still be completed on time .
blocked or closed highways have limited deliveries of fuel to gas stations , leading to a shortage in some parts of germany .
the oil company esso reported that 20 german gas stations were completely out of gas .
icy roads kept fuel trucks from leaving at shell oil refineries .
race against the clock the timing of this particular cold snap is especially problematic for logistics companies hoping to deliver christmas presents on time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting gifts delivered on time could be a challenge christine hoeger , a spokeswoman for the online shopping portal amazon , said delivery of packages could be delayed by up to two days .
dhl was a little more optimistic for its christmas deliveries .
" we 're assuming that we can deliver all packages that reach us by midday on december 22 on time for christmas , " said claus korfmacher , a dhl spokesman in bonn .
despite the guarantee , getting presents under the christmas tree on time this year in germany could prove to be a challenge .

but now a german daily has claimed that the majority of german sinologists kowtow to china . many countries defied chinese diplomatic pressure earlier this month , by sending an envoy to the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo for the chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
many western intellectuals applauded when liu , who is serving an 11-year jail term , was proclaimed this year ’ s nobel peace laureate .
politicians from all over the world demanded his immediate release .
but journalist and china expert kai strittmatter said there was a conspicuous silence among germany ’ s sinologists .
bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is the first chinese citizen to ever receive a nobel prize " even though they are focusing their attention on modern china more and more , a chinese citizen gets a nobel prize for the first time , and they say almost nothing , " he said .
" that ’ s strange and the question is why ? "
some german sinologists depend on beijing in a recent article in the sueddeutsche zeitung , strittmatter argued that german sinologists had stayed mum because their jobs were partly dependent on the chinese government .
he pointed out that two professorships at goettingen university were sponsored by beijing .
meanwhile , jörg-meinhard rudolph from the university of applied sciences in ludwigshafen said that that some german sinologists feared future research projects could be jeopardized if they were to displease the chinese authorities .
" they are interested in doing research in china .
chinese academics can conduct research independently in germany , " he explained .
" but foreign , german or european academics in china can not work alone .
they need so-called partners . "
influence of confucius institutes the connection between the chinese departments of german universities and confucius institutes has also come under scrutiny .
there are 11 confucius institutes located in german universities .
these establishments are the chinese equivalent of the goethe institute or british council , promoting chinese culture and language abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many see the confucius institutes as a chinese soft-power tool many of the staff employed to teach chinese language courses are financed by beijing .
some critics say that china has thus been influencing the direction of chinese studies in germany .
political minefield for german sinologist susanne weigelin-schwiedrzik , who is the head of vienna university ’ s chinese department , " every single scholar has to make his or her position very clear because this is a highly-sensitive political minefield . "
" the best thing to do is keep a distance .
i work with chinese academics but i always make it clear to them that my research is not dependent on them , " she said .
although she also acknowledged that freedom of speech included a scholar ’ s right to remain silent on certain issues , but also thought academics do bear some responsibility as public figures .
" i am of the opinion that i am morally obliged - as someone who is open and has a view of the world and as a european intellectual - to observe and analyze the world , from beyond my academic sphere . " after all the public criticism in the media , it will be interesting to see whether more german china experts remember this the next time a chinese dissident is awarded a prize .

this comes after 11 republicans broke rank with their party , giving president obama the two-thirds senate majority he would need for ratification .
however this has been anything but plain sailing for the president .
earlier this year , mitt romney , generally considered to be a leading republican contender for the 2012 us presidential election , chose an op-ed in the washington post to pour scorn on the so-called new start arms reduction treaty negotiated by the obama administration with russia . under the headline " obama 's worst foreign policy mistake , " romney , who lost the republican nomination for the 2008 presidential election to john mccain , did n't mince words .
arguing that the treaty was badly negotiated by the obama administration and that it puts us security at stake , he called it a non-starter that must not be ratified . sico van der meer , an arms control expert at the netherlands institute of international relations , does n't think romney 's op-ed had much merit : " in my opinion he is completely wrong , " he told deutsche welle .
" the republicans ask why should the russians reduce less than we should ?
i think this is a debate you can have , but in my opinion and i think for most people in europe the amount of warheads that will be reduced through the start treaty is very low anyway , so i do n't think there should be any problems with this treaty . "
better than nothing kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and now managing director of the center on transatlantic relations at the johns hopkins university , offers a more nuanced take on romney 's piece : " i read the romney piece and i thought the criticism there was very very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney is eyeing another presidential bid in 2012 the new start treaty is certainly no breakthrough , argues volker .
" the treaty itself does n't do a whole lot , it does n't reduce numbers that much .
in fact by some analysis it may even give some headroom to the russians on what they can do based on the counting rules . "
in addition , the deal also does n't improve access for verification and inspections and excludes the large stockpile of russia 's tactical nuclear weapons , adds volker .
" but what it does do is it establishes a legal framework around the strategic nuclear weapons that exist , " says volker .
" on balance that is probably a good thing to do rather than a bad thing to do . "
while the new pact is mostly regarded as an important follow-up to the expired start treaty , most experts consider it a modest step rather than an ambitious leap toward nuclear disarmament .
it will cut the number of deployed nuclear weapons by some 25 percent .
each side would be limited to 800 armed launchers .
the agreement also envisages slashing the number of nuclear warheads within the next seven years to 1,550 from currently 2,200 , which goes beyond a previous planned cut to 1,700 .
by most accounts the us may need to phase out more weapons than the russian side .
sico van der meer would have wanted a much more aggressive arms reduction pact , but he agrees with volker that this deal is better than no deal at all .
slow progress " europeans support the treaty not only because they are afraid of nuclear war , " he says .
" i do n't think that is really a possibility at the moment .
but the more weapons there are , the more risks there are for accidents or thefts of nuclear weapons by terrorists for example .
to reduce those risks is very important for europe , but also for the whole world . " # bwhile there are ultimately good reasons to pass the start treaty , volker remains deeply skeptical about the prospects for future arms reduction . " it generally cheers european hearts to see that arms control is moving ahead , " he says .
" i do n't think it is a harbinger of future success for arms control .
i do n't think the russians have any intentions of limiting their tactical nuclear weapons .
they have been very clear about that .
they have also pulled out of the cse treaty -lrb- conventional armed forces in europe - ed . -rrb- and i do n't see them going back into the cse .
so i do n't see this pointing the way ahead . "

blocked freeways have cut off supply lines for car manufacturers , gas stations and delivery companies . in snow-covered germany , trying to get around on streets that have n't been salted is next to impossible , and road salt company k + s is benefitting from the increase in demand .
their stock on the german exchange dax has risen significantly in the last few days .
in other branches of the economy , however , the hard winter is turning into a serious problem .
" production in the german construction industry is at a standstill , " said heiko stiepelmann from a building industry group .
excavation , road works , and building construction have especially taken a hit . "
the construction industry is facing its second battle with winter weather in 2010 .
in the first three months of the year the sector was faced with similar problems of snow and ice .
" if it repeats itself at the end of the year , we 'll hardly be able to record a profit , " said stiepelmann .
economy remains thawed the construction industry is n't alone in feeling the sting of the cold and snowy weather .
companies are postponing business trips .
restaurants and stores are suffering as customers find it difficult to get around .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer shoppers are braving the weather " the harsh and early winter is stunting economic growth at the end of the year , " said volker treier , lead economist of the german chamber of commerce .
last winter cost economic growth a half percentage point , and treier says this winter is pushing things in a similar direction .
" but the general economic boom is too strong to be held back by a hard winter , " he added .
car problems the ford car factory in cologne was another victim of the winter conditions .
production was stopped last week because a delivery of heaters could n't be made on time .
" the heaters are from a factory in northern france , but france and belgium closed the freeways for semi-trucks that weighed more than seven and a half tons , " said bernd meier , ford 's press officer at the factory in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many deliveries did n't even make it to the freeway the opel factory in bochum faced shortages of certain car parts , but the finished cars could still be completed on time .
blocked or closed highways have limited deliveries of fuel to gas stations , leading to a shortage in some parts of germany .
the oil company esso reported that 20 german gas stations were completely out of gas .

the ground and air firing exercises will take place at a firing range in pocheon , some 20 kilometers away from the mainland border . just as the south korean army announced more maneuvers for thursday , the navy began a four-day exercise just off its eastern coast , some 100 kilometers away from the disputed sea border with the north . tension has been high on the peninsula since north korea ’ s attack last month of the island of yeonpyeong that killed four south koreans , including two civilians . " we will retaliate thoroughly if the north commits another provocative act like the shelling of yeonpyeong , " first armored battalion commander choo eun-sik told south korea ’ s yonhap news agency . meanwhile , a senior south korean military commander said that the drill on thursday at the pocheon range would " demonstrate our solid military preparedness . " bildunterschrift : north korea shelled yeonpyeong island near the disputed sea border last month ' no need to retaliate against every provocation ' on monday , the south korean navy carried out a live-fire drill on yeonpyeong despite repeated warnings from the north that it would hit back , but pyongyang issued a statement saying it " did not feel the need to retaliate against every despicable military provocation . " although pyongyang 's failure to retaliate triggered a brief sigh of relief in south korea , there is still a strong sense of apprehension . skepticism about pyongyang 's sincerity neither seoul nor washington has reacted positively to apparent overtures by pyongyang .
us troubleshooter bill richardson said on monday that the north had agreed to allow international nuclear inspectors back in the country , but these reports were not confirmed . bildunterschrift : south korean marines stand guard on yeonpyeong island us president barack obama 's spokesman robert gibbs also expressed doubts that north korea wanted to come back to the negotiating table for denuclearization talks . " we 're not going to get a table and a room and have six-party talks just for the feel-good notion of having six-party talks , ” gibbs said .
" when and if the north koreans are ever serious about living up to their obligations , then we can think about restarting six-party talks .

programming content and structure has been adapted and updated a number of times – a process that has always been guided by an efficient overall concept of the way germany ’ s media image is presented to the outside world .
the most radical change was dw-tv ’ s repositioning as of january 1 , 1999 .
since then , dw-tv has focused on news and information , with an additional spotlight on the arts and culture in general .
deutsche welle ’ s experience with global television goes back to 1963 .
that was when dw , then based in cologne , sent a foreign-language adaptation of a german film beyond germany ’ s borders for the first time .
the company transtel -lrb- today known as dw-transtel -rrb- was founded to transcribe and distribute german tv productions .
as one of the shareholders , dw took charge of the selection and adaptation of the programs , as well as the acquisition of foreign rights .
from 1983 , dw began producing television programs on its own .
in 1998 , transtel was closed down and its tasks were fully integrated into dw but the brand dw-transtel remained .
in this way , hundreds of hours of programming continue to go out to the world every year in many languages .

this comes after 11 republicans broke rank with their party , giving president obama the two-thirds senate majority he would need for ratification .
however this has been anything but plain sailing for the president .
earlier this year , mitt romney , generally considered to be a leading republican contender for the 2012 us presidential election , chose an op-ed in the washington post to pour scorn on the so-called new start arms reduction treaty negotiated by the obama administration with russia . under the headline " obama 's worst foreign policy mistake , " romney , who lost the republican nomination for the 2008 presidential election to john mccain , did n't mince words .
arguing that the treaty was badly negotiated by the obama administration and that it puts us security at stake , he called it a non-starter that must not be ratified . sico van der meer , an arms control expert at the netherlands institute of international relations , does n't think romney 's op-ed had much merit : " in my opinion he is completely wrong , " he told deutsche welle .
" the republicans ask why should the russians reduce less than we should ?
i think this is a debate you can have , but in my opinion and i think for most people in europe the amount of warheads that will be reduced through the start treaty is very low anyway , so i do n't think there should be any problems with this treaty . "
better than nothing kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and now managing director of the center on transatlantic relations at the johns hopkins university , offers a more nuanced take on romney 's piece : " i read the romney piece and i thought the criticism there was very very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney is eyeing another presidential bid in 2012 the new start treaty is certainly no breakthrough , argues volker .
" the treaty itself does n't do a whole lot , it does n't reduce numbers that much .
in fact by some analysis it may even give some headroom to the russians on what they can do based on the counting rules . "
in addition , the deal also does n't improve access for verification and inspections and excludes the large stockpile of russia 's tactical nuclear weapons , adds volker .
" but what it does do is it establishes a legal framework around the strategic nuclear weapons that exist , " says volker .
" on balance that is probably a good thing to do rather than a bad thing to do . "
while the new pact is mostly regarded as an important follow-up to the expired start treaty , most experts consider it a modest step rather than an ambitious leap toward nuclear disarmament .
it will cut the number of deployed nuclear weapons by some 25 percent .
each side would be limited to 800 armed launchers .
the agreement also envisages slashing the number of nuclear warheads within the next seven years to 1,550 from currently 2,200 , which goes beyond a previous planned cut to 1,700 .
by most accounts the us may need to phase out more weapons than the russian side .
sico van der meer would have wanted a much more aggressive arms reduction pact , but he agrees with volker that this deal is better than no deal at all .
slow progress " europeans support the treaty not only because they are afraid of nuclear war , " he says .
" i do n't think that is really a possibility at the moment .
but the more weapons there are , the more risks there are for accidents or thefts of nuclear weapons by terrorists for example .
to reduce those risks is very important for europe , but also for the whole world . " # bwhile there are ultimately good reasons to pass the start treaty , volker remains deeply skeptical about the prospects for future arms reduction . " it generally cheers european hearts to see that arms control is moving ahead , " he says .
" i do n't think it is a harbinger of future success for arms control .
i do n't think the russians have any intentions of limiting their tactical nuclear weapons .
they have been very clear about that .
they have also pulled out of the cse treaty -lrb- conventional armed forces in europe - ed . -rrb- and i do n't see them going back into the cse .
so i do n't see this pointing the way ahead . "

" those who hide terrorists conceal crimes and hide criminals ; there can be no other assumption here , " medvedev said . " one understands that the extradition is quite complicated but it is important that international cooperation in this field should be in place between all those interested in fighting against terrorism . " " india and russia are both victims of terrorism , " indian prime minister manmohan singh responded .

but now a german daily has claimed that the majority of german sinologists kowtow to china . many countries defied chinese diplomatic pressure earlier this month , by sending an envoy to the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo for the chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
many western intellectuals applauded when liu , who is serving an 11-year jail term , was proclaimed this year ’ s nobel peace laureate .
politicians from all over the world demanded his immediate release .
but journalist and china expert kai strittmatter said there was a conspicuous silence among germany ’ s sinologists .
bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is the first chinese citizen to ever receive a nobel prize " even though they are focusing their attention on modern china more and more , a chinese citizen gets a nobel prize for the first time , and they say almost nothing , " he said .
" that ’ s strange and the question is why ? "
some german sinologists depend on beijing in a recent article in the sueddeutsche zeitung , strittmatter argued that german sinologists had stayed mum because their jobs were partly dependent on the chinese government .
he pointed out that two professorships at goettingen university were sponsored by beijing .
meanwhile , jörg-meinhard rudolph from the university of applied sciences in ludwigshafen said that that some german sinologists feared future research projects could be jeopardized if they were to displease the chinese authorities .
" they are interested in doing research in china .
chinese academics can conduct research independently in germany , " he explained .
" but foreign , german or european academics in china can not work alone .
they need so-called partners . "
influence of confucius institutes the connection between the chinese departments of german universities and confucius institutes has also come under scrutiny .
there are 11 confucius institutes located in german universities .
these establishments are the chinese equivalent of the goethe institute or british council , promoting chinese culture and language abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many see the confucius institutes as a chinese soft-power tool many of the staff employed to teach chinese language courses are financed by beijing .
some critics say that china has thus been influencing the direction of chinese studies in germany .
political minefield for german sinologist susanne weigelin-schwiedrzik , who is the head of vienna university ’ s chinese department , " every single scholar has to make his or her position very clear because this is a highly-sensitive political minefield . "
" the best thing to do is keep a distance .
i work with chinese academics but i always make it clear to them that my research is not dependent on them , " she said .
although she also acknowledged that freedom of speech included a scholar ’ s right to remain silent on certain issues , but also thought academics do bear some responsibility as public figures .
" i am of the opinion that i am morally obliged - as someone who is open and has a view of the world and as a european intellectual - to observe and analyze the world , from beyond my academic sphere . " after all the public criticism in the media , it will be interesting to see whether more german china experts remember this the next time a chinese dissident is awarded a prize .

the most radical change was dw-tv ’ s repositioning as of january 1 , 1999 .
since then , dw-tv has focused on news and information , with an additional spotlight on the arts and culture in general .
deutsche welle ’ s experience with global television goes back to 1963 .
that was when dw , then based in cologne , sent a foreign-language adaptation of a german film beyond germany ’ s borders for the first time .
the company transtel -lrb- today known as dw-transtel -rrb- was founded to transcribe and distribute german tv productions .
as one of the shareholders , dw took charge of the selection and adaptation of the programs , as well as the acquisition of foreign rights .
from 1983 , dw began producing television programs on its own .
in 1998 , transtel was closed down and its tasks were fully integrated into dw but the brand dw-transtel remained .
in this way , hundreds of hours of programming continue to go out to the world every year in many languages .
programs are adapted in and dispatched from berlin . september 2010 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a majority of 64 percent say they celebrate christmas alongside other important occasions .
nineteen percent regard christmas as the most significant holiday of the year .
bildunterschrift : under soviet rule , the communist regime suppressed religion and marginalized christmas , instead focusing on the new year as the main holiday of the year .
after the fall of communism , christian celebrations and the christian orthodox religion came back into favor , as many russians turned to the church and religion in the wake of political turmoil in the 1990s .
many russians are religious the deutsche welle poll found that just under a third of russians - 29 percent - consider themselves religious , with most of those saying they go to church on holidays like christmas .
three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .
bildunterschrift : according to the poll , many young people are religious , with just 16 percent of russians under the age of 29 saying they do not believe in god .
russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .
bildunterschrift : but according to the deutsche welle poll , many russians would support a closer relationship between the two churches .
almost half of those polled are in favor of a meeting between the pope benedict xvi and kyrill i. forty percent say they are neutral on this issue .
a small minority of just 2 percent are opposed to such a meeting .
the ifak institute surveyed 1,000 russians in december 2010 .
the margin of error is no more than 3 percent .

" the airport operation is getting back to normal , " airport spokesman thomas uber said .
" but it will take a while to catch up . "
there was a backlog of around 3,500 passengers at germany 's busiest hub .
a spokeswoman for london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , said it was operating 70 percent of a normal day 's service on wednesday .

a special long-distance timetable was to run until december 31 .
" we are considerably overburdened , " deutsche bahn board member berthold huber said .
the rail operator bahn planned to concentrate on its busy north-south and east-west routes , pulling some high speed trains away from quieter services . huber estimated that around 50,000 extra passengers per day were looking to make long-distance rail trips over the christmas period . days of travel disruption the european commission on tuesday criticized transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions .

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .
however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .
however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

blocked freeways have cut off supply lines for car manufacturers , gas stations and delivery companies . in snow-covered germany , trying to get around on streets that have n't been salted is next to impossible , and road salt company k + s is benefitting from the increase in demand .
their stock on the german exchange dax has risen significantly in the last few days .
in other branches of the economy , however , the hard winter is turning into a serious problem .
" production in the german construction industry is at a standstill , " said heiko stiepelmann from a building industry group .
excavation , road works , and building construction have especially taken a hit . "
the construction industry is facing its second battle with winter weather in 2010 .
in the first three months of the year the sector was faced with similar problems of snow and ice .
" if it repeats itself at the end of the year , we 'll hardly be able to record a profit , " said stiepelmann .
economy remains thawed the construction industry is n't alone in feeling the sting of the cold and snowy weather .
companies are postponing business trips .
restaurants and stores are suffering as customers find it difficult to get around .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer shoppers are braving the weather " the harsh and early winter is stunting economic growth at the end of the year , " said volker treier , lead economist of the german chamber of commerce .
last winter cost economic growth a half percentage point , and treier says this winter is pushing things in a similar direction .
" but the general economic boom is too strong to be held back by a hard winter , " he added .
car problems the ford car factory in cologne was another victim of the winter conditions .
production was stopped last week because a delivery of heaters could n't be made on time .
" the heaters are from a factory in northern france , but france and belgium closed the freeways for semi-trucks that weighed more than seven and a half tons , " said bernd meier , ford 's press officer at the factory in cologne .

blocked or closed highways have limited deliveries of fuel to gas stations , leading to a shortage in some parts of germany .
the oil company esso reported that 20 german gas stations were completely out of gas .
icy roads kept fuel trucks from leaving at shell oil refineries .
race against the clock the timing of this particular cold snap is especially problematic for logistics companies hoping to deliver christmas presents on time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting gifts delivered on time could be a challenge christine hoeger , a spokeswoman for the online shopping portal amazon , said delivery of packages could be delayed by up to two days .
dhl was a little more optimistic for its christmas deliveries .
" we 're assuming that we can deliver all packages that reach us by midday on december 22 on time for christmas , " said claus korfmacher , a dhl spokesman in bonn .
despite the guarantee , getting presents under the christmas tree on time this year in germany could prove to be a challenge .

but now a german daily has claimed that the majority of german sinologists kowtow to china . many countries defied chinese diplomatic pressure earlier this month , by sending an envoy to the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo for the chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
many western intellectuals applauded when liu , who is serving an 11-year jail term , was proclaimed this year ’ s nobel peace laureate .
politicians from all over the world demanded his immediate release .
but journalist and china expert kai strittmatter said there was a conspicuous silence among germany ’ s sinologists .
bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is the first chinese citizen to ever receive a nobel prize " even though they are focusing their attention on modern china more and more , a chinese citizen gets a nobel prize for the first time , and they say almost nothing , " he said .
" that ’ s strange and the question is why ? "
some german sinologists depend on beijing in a recent article in the sueddeutsche zeitung , strittmatter argued that german sinologists had stayed mum because their jobs were partly dependent on the chinese government .
he pointed out that two professorships at goettingen university were sponsored by beijing .
meanwhile , jörg-meinhard rudolph from the university of applied sciences in ludwigshafen said that that some german sinologists feared future research projects could be jeopardized if they were to displease the chinese authorities .
" they are interested in doing research in china .
chinese academics can conduct research independently in germany , " he explained .
" but foreign , german or european academics in china can not work alone .
they need so-called partners . "
influence of confucius institutes the connection between the chinese departments of german universities and confucius institutes has also come under scrutiny .
there are 11 confucius institutes located in german universities .
these establishments are the chinese equivalent of the goethe institute or british council , promoting chinese culture and language abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many see the confucius institutes as a chinese soft-power tool many of the staff employed to teach chinese language courses are financed by beijing .
some critics say that china has thus been influencing the direction of chinese studies in germany .
political minefield for german sinologist susanne weigelin-schwiedrzik , who is the head of vienna university ’ s chinese department , " every single scholar has to make his or her position very clear because this is a highly-sensitive political minefield . "
" the best thing to do is keep a distance .
i work with chinese academics but i always make it clear to them that my research is not dependent on them , " she said .
although she also acknowledged that freedom of speech included a scholar ’ s right to remain silent on certain issues , but also thought academics do bear some responsibility as public figures .
" i am of the opinion that i am morally obliged - as someone who is open and has a view of the world and as a european intellectual - to observe and analyze the world , from beyond my academic sphere . " after all the public criticism in the media , it will be interesting to see whether more german china experts remember this the next time a chinese dissident is awarded a prize .

a majority of 64 percent say they celebrate christmas alongside other important occasions .
nineteen percent regard christmas as the most significant holiday of the year .
bildunterschrift : under soviet rule , the communist regime suppressed religion and marginalized christmas , instead focusing on the new year as the main holiday of the year .
after the fall of communism , christian celebrations and the christian orthodox religion came back into favor , as many russians turned to the church and religion in the wake of political turmoil in the 1990s .
many russians are religious the deutsche welle poll found that just under a third of russians - 29 percent - consider themselves religious , with most of those saying they go to church on holidays like christmas .
three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .
bildunterschrift : according to the poll , many young people are religious , with just 16 percent of russians under the age of 29 saying they do not believe in god .
russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .
bildunterschrift : but according to the deutsche welle poll , many russians would support a closer relationship between the two churches .
almost half of those polled are in favor of a meeting between the pope benedict xvi and kyrill i. forty percent say they are neutral on this issue .
a small minority of just 2 percent are opposed to such a meeting .
the ifak institute surveyed 1,000 russians in december 2010 .
the margin of error is no more than 3 percent .

a majority of 64 percent say they celebrate christmas alongside other important occasions .
nineteen percent regard christmas as the most significant holiday of the year .
bildunterschrift : under soviet rule , the communist regime suppressed religion and marginalized christmas , instead focusing on the new year as the main holiday of the year .
after the fall of communism , christian celebrations and the christian orthodox religion came back into favor , as many russians turned to the church and religion in the wake of political turmoil in the 1990s .
many russians are religious the deutsche welle poll found that just under a third of russians - 29 percent - consider themselves religious , with most of those saying they go to church on holidays like christmas .
three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .
bildunterschrift : according to the poll , many young people are religious , with just 16 percent of russians under the age of 29 saying they do not believe in god .
russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .
bildunterschrift : but according to the deutsche welle poll , many russians would support a closer relationship between the two churches .
almost half of those polled are in favor of a meeting between the pope benedict xvi and kyrill i. forty percent say they are neutral on this issue .
a small minority of just 2 percent are opposed to such a meeting .
the ifak institute surveyed 1,000 russians in december 2010 .
the margin of error is no more than 3 percent .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said .

that could be the job ad posted every year in the search for santas .
across germany , companies turn to students to stick on beards and spread the holiday spirit . " do you have a moment ? "
santa asks a shopper in a busy store in the western germany city of bonn .
in the days before christmas , even santa has to ask politely .
after all , christmas time is shopping time .
but for santa , with his goody-filled sack , most people are happy to pause a moment . resplendent in his red velvet trousers and jacket , heavy black boots and , of course , the warm santa claus hat , christoph chapman has spent three hours at work this afternoon , in a large department store in downtown bonn . " the costume is very itchy , especially the beard , " he admitted . only the tall and round need apply normally , chapman studies political science and history in bonn .
but today he is santa claus .
he makes his way throughout the store , handing out apples , chocolate and stuffed animals to children and parents .
in his wake is a palpable sense of relief from the pre-christmas stress , and that is why the job is so fun , according to chapman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the student affairs association posts christmas jobs online chapman 's girlfriend found the job advertisement among the web pages of an online job site for bonn students .
the only requirements were a friendly attitude and certain santa claus-esque attributes . " actually , i still needed a big belly , but my girlfriend would n't have liked that , " chapman said , laughing . high demand positions as early as october businesses and families started looking for students to fill positions surrounding the holiday season .
santas and angels are in particularly high demand for company events , marketing campaigns or the giving of gifts on christmas eve .
also sought after are christmas tree vendors and employees to man the stalls for the many christmas markets . " these are well-paid jobs for which you need no special skills , " said mirjam von der mark , a marketing manager at studentenwerk bonn , a student services association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other jobs during the season are to be found at the christmas market in berlin the work placement of santa and his helpers by studentenwerk has been around since 1949 .
last year alone students made up the 500 santas and 50 angels who brought gifts to families in berlin and brandenburg . in order to ensure the recruits can ho-ho-ho correctly , students in berlin can attend workshops on the fundamentals of santa claus and angels .
the official angels and santa claus guidelines recommend being , " child-loving , innovative , and reliable . " " it 's cold , but it 's fun ! " jennifer bohne , however , does n't need a workshop for her job .
the 23-year-old student works at the bonn christmas market .
for five weeks she 's been standing behind the counter selling toasted almonds and cashews in small bags . " it 's cold , but it 's fun , " bohne said , adding that next year she 'll definitely be back . but whoever wants one of these coveted christmas jobs has to be quick .
finding applicants for an inventory job can sometimes be a tough affair , marketing manager mirjam von der mark said .
but she said the jobs disappear faster than fresh-baked christmas cookies . " as soon as the ad is online , my phone rings off the hook , " she said . author : svenja ueing -lrb- sjt -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .
however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .
however , it was able to reopen its second runway late in the day , prompting hope that the situation might ease . charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays . other large german hubs like munich , stuttgart and hamburg reported fewer problems with their runways on tuesday , but added that services to and from the more heavily affected airports were still subject to disruptions . author : mark hallam , thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that could be the job ad posted every year in the search for santas .
across germany , companies turn to students to stick on beards and spread the holiday spirit . " do you have a moment ? "
santa asks a shopper in a busy store in the western germany city of bonn .
in the days before christmas , even santa has to ask politely .
after all , christmas time is shopping time .
but for santa , with his goody-filled sack , most people are happy to pause a moment . resplendent in his red velvet trousers and jacket , heavy black boots and , of course , the warm santa claus hat , christoph chapman has spent three hours at work this afternoon , in a large department store in downtown bonn . " the costume is very itchy , especially the beard , " he admitted . only the tall and round need apply normally , chapman studies political science and history in bonn .
but today he is santa claus .
he makes his way throughout the store , handing out apples , chocolate and stuffed animals to children and parents .
in his wake is a palpable sense of relief from the pre-christmas stress , and that is why the job is so fun , according to chapman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the student affairs association posts christmas jobs online chapman 's girlfriend found the job advertisement among the web pages of an online job site for bonn students .
the only requirements were a friendly attitude and certain santa claus-esque attributes . " actually , i still needed a big belly , but my girlfriend would n't have liked that , " chapman said , laughing . high demand positions as early as october businesses and families started looking for students to fill positions surrounding the holiday season .
santas and angels are in particularly high demand for company events , marketing campaigns or the giving of gifts on christmas eve .
also sought after are christmas tree vendors and employees to man the stalls for the many christmas markets .

last year alone students made up the 500 santas and 50 angels who brought gifts to families in berlin and brandenburg . in order to ensure the recruits can ho-ho-ho correctly , students in berlin can attend workshops on the fundamentals of santa claus and angels .
the official angels and santa claus guidelines recommend being , " child-loving , innovative , and reliable . " " it 's cold , but it 's fun ! " jennifer bohne , however , does n't need a workshop for her job .
the 23-year-old student works at the bonn christmas market .
for five weeks she 's been standing behind the counter selling toasted almonds and cashews in small bags . " it 's cold , but it 's fun , " bohne said , adding that next year she 'll definitely be back . but whoever wants one of these coveted christmas jobs has to be quick .
finding applicants for an inventory job can sometimes be a tough affair , marketing manager mirjam von der mark said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.12.2010 critics question lidl 's call for 10-euro minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl pays its employees at least 10 euros an hour lidl has surprised germany by calling for a 10-euro -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- minimum hourly wage for retail workers – that 's higher than the level being demanded by trade unions .
critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schalke 's win caps an impressive recent run , and prompted coach felix magath to grant his players more time off over christmas . schalke won their last match of 2010 , beating german second division leaders augsburg 1-0 in the german cup .
the victory secured the royal blues a place in the quarter-finals , and it also earned them a longer christmas holiday .
last month coach felix magath , angered by his club 's dreadful start to the season , had curtailed the players ' vacation time , ordering them back to training on december 27 .
" i 'm very satisfied , and that 's why we 'll all have a break until january 2 , " magath told reporters after the match in augsburg .
" i 'm satisfied with my team 's performance .
it was a tough task , especially considering the condition of the pitch . "
in all competitions , schalke have now won five consecutive games .
after weeks in the relegation zone , they are up to a solid 10th in the bundesliga , and they 're through to the knockout stages of the lucrative champions ' league .
tuesday 's win on a snow-covered augsburg pitch was by no means easy , and it took schalke 84 minutes to find the decisive goal .
veteran spanish striker raul , who has been the personification of schalke 's ice-cold turned red-hot season so far , did the hard work - taking on three defenders and then putting peruvian winger jefferson farfan through to score from the right flank .

icelandic midfielder gylfi sigurdsson opened the scoring for hoffenheim with a trademark free-kick from just outside the area , but a lot of credit for the goal must go to moenchengladbach keeper christofer heimeroth .
instead of shooting over the wall , sigurdsson elected to try his luck on heimeroth 's side of the goal , but as he struck it the gladbach keeper dived away from his station towards the other side of the net in a spectacularly misguided gamble .
senegalese forward demba ba scored hoffenheim 's second on 63 minutes , a short range finish from a sejad salihovic corner that three gladbach defenders failed to clear .
as well as securing them a spot in the last eight , the win broke a run of four consecutive draws for hoffenheim , who have slipped back into mid-table in recent weeks after a very strong start to the season .
for gladbach , however , the result completes a rather miserable run leading up to the christmas holidays .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.12.2010 critics question lidl 's call for 10-euro minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl pays its employees at least 10 euros an hour lidl has surprised germany by calling for a 10-euro -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- minimum hourly wage for retail workers – that 's higher than the level being demanded by trade unions .
critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schalke 's win caps an impressive recent run , and prompted coach felix magath to grant his players more time off over christmas . schalke won their last match of 2010 , beating german second division leaders augsburg 1-0 in the german cup .
the victory secured the royal blues a place in the quarter-finals , and it also earned them a longer christmas holiday .
last month coach felix magath , angered by his club 's dreadful start to the season , had curtailed the players ' vacation time , ordering them back to training on december 27 .
" i 'm very satisfied , and that 's why we 'll all have a break until january 2 , " magath told reporters after the match in augsburg .
" i 'm satisfied with my team 's performance .
it was a tough task , especially considering the condition of the pitch . "
in all competitions , schalke have now won five consecutive games .
after weeks in the relegation zone , they are up to a solid 10th in the bundesliga , and they 're through to the knockout stages of the lucrative champions ' league .
tuesday 's win on a snow-covered augsburg pitch was by no means easy , and it took schalke 84 minutes to find the decisive goal .
veteran spanish striker raul , who has been the personification of schalke 's ice-cold turned red-hot season so far , did the hard work - taking on three defenders and then putting peruvian winger jefferson farfan through to score from the right flank .
hoffenheim pile more misery on moenchengladbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a good day for all the bundesliga 's boys in blue matches pitting offenbach against nuremberg and koblenz against kaiserslautern were both canceled due to bad weather conditions on tuesday , but in the second fixture that did go ahead , hoffenheim beat visitors borussia moenchengladbach 2-0 .
icelandic midfielder gylfi sigurdsson opened the scoring for hoffenheim with a trademark free-kick from just outside the area , but a lot of credit for the goal must go to moenchengladbach keeper christofer heimeroth .
instead of shooting over the wall , sigurdsson elected to try his luck on heimeroth 's side of the goal , but as he struck it the gladbach keeper dived away from his station towards the other side of the net in a spectacularly misguided gamble .
senegalese forward demba ba scored hoffenheim 's second on 63 minutes , a short range finish from a sejad salihovic corner that three gladbach defenders failed to clear .
as well as securing them a spot in the last eight , the win broke a run of four consecutive draws for hoffenheim , who have slipped back into mid-table in recent weeks after a very strong start to the season .
for gladbach , however , the result completes a rather miserable run leading up to the christmas holidays .
as well as dropping out of the german cup with this defeat , moenchengladbach go into the winter break rock bottom of the bundesliga , having also lost five consecutive league matches .
in wednesday 's german cup games - weather permitting - wolfsburg entertain cottbus , duisburg travel to cologne , aachen play host to frankfurt , and stuttgart face a tough home test against bayern munich .

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa wants to get back to business as usual the national rail operator , deutsche bahn , announced that it would put a special long-distance timetable into service on wednesday , designed to provide extra trains for the holiday rush . " we are considerably overburdened , " long-distance chairman for deutsche bahn , berthold huber said .
deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether . " every train that 's fit to roll is out on the tracks , " bahn chairman ulrich homburg said , apologizing for the problems . brussels blasts airport response the european commission on tuesday slammed transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says airports should have done more to avert scenes like this one " i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . " kallas was particularly critical of the level of disruption at airports , and said he would meet with airport officials in the next few days to " ask for further explanations " about what has gone wrong and to " take a hard look " at how to operate more effectively in the future . he said that further regulation of the industry might be necessary to ensure that " minimum service requirements " are maintained .
kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 22.12.2010 majority of russians embrace christmas despite communist past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians celebrate christmas on january 7 over 80 percent of russians celebrate christmas and a third see themselves as religious 20 years after the end of communism and its atheist ethos , according to a deutsche welle poll . twenty years after the fall of the communist regime in russia , which enforced atheism and marginalized christmas , 83 percent of russians say they celebrate the holiday , according to a poll carried out by the ifak institute and commissioned by deutsche welle .
a majority of 64 percent say they celebrate christmas alongside other important occasions .
nineteen percent regard christmas as the most significant holiday of the year .
bildunterschrift : under soviet rule , the communist regime suppressed religion and marginalized christmas , instead focusing on the new year as the main holiday of the year .
after the fall of communism , christian celebrations and the christian orthodox religion came back into favor , as many russians turned to the church and religion in the wake of political turmoil in the 1990s .
many russians are religious the deutsche welle poll found that just under a third of russians - 29 percent - consider themselves religious , with most of those saying they go to church on holidays like christmas .
three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .
bildunterschrift : according to the poll , many young people are religious , with just 16 percent of russians under the age of 29 saying they do not believe in god .
russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .
bildunterschrift : but according to the deutsche welle poll , many russians would support a closer relationship between the two churches .
almost half of those polled are in favor of a meeting between the pope benedict xvi and kyrill i. forty percent say they are neutral on this issue .
a small minority of just 2 percent are opposed to such a meeting .
the ifak institute surveyed 1,000 russians in december 2010 .
the margin of error is no more than 3 percent .

hungary assumes the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . german chancellor angela merkel has warned hungary that a controversial new law to control media reporting must adhere to european union values on freedom of the press .
the chancellor was eager to ensure that the law passed by the hungarian government did not violate european principles on the rule of law , said merkel ’ s deputy spokesman christoph steegmans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the law must not transgress european principles steegmans stressed that such compliance was particularly necessary at present , with hungary preparing to take up the rotating presidency of the eu in january .
" as a future president of the european union , hungary naturally has a special responsibility for the image of the european union as a whole , " he said .
under plans approved by hungary 's parliament on monday , a national media authority will oversee public news production and be able to impose sizeable fines on private media that break rules on political reporting .
representatives voice concern eu parliamentarians also expressed concern about the hungarian government 's strict new media legislation .
" we shall measure hungary against the european standards of press freedom precisely , " said martin schulz , leader of the socialists in the european parliament .
schulz told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau that , should those standards not be met , budapest would face " big problems . "
alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in brussels , called it " extremely dubious " that an eu presidency-designate wanted to " silence critical media in their own country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's martin schulz heads the european parliament 's second biggest bloc " the hungarian government must ask itself if it is absolutely committed to the european union venture , endorses its values and can assume the eu presidency next week , " alvaro said .
press under wraps the hungarian government has said the legislation is in line with that of other eu countries .
it said the law was long overdue , and necessary because of changes in technology and news content .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said that regulating online media was technologically impossible and would damage freedom of expression .
" such concentration of power in regulatory authorities is unprecedented in european democracies , and it harms media freedom , " the osce 's media freedom representative , dunja mijatovic , said .
reporters without borders criticized the new legislation as vague .
" much too much is left open to interpretation , nothing is clear , " olivier basille from the press freedom watchdog told euobserver.com.
basille questioned whether hungary could be a credible representative for the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publications in hungary have protested the new law luxembourg 's foreign minister , jean asselborn , has called for the european commission , the eu 's executive body , to take swift action against the legislation .
" the plans clearly violate the spirit and the letter of eu treaties , " asselborn told news agency reuters .
" it 's a direct danger for democracy .
the state will control opinion . "
board controlled by ruling party the law creates a five-member board to oversee both private and state-run media .
the body , which will be controlled by the ruling right-wing conservative government of prime minister viktor orban 's fidesz party , will be able to impose heavy fines on the producers of radio , television , online and newspaper content that is deemed " not politically balanced . "
earlier this month hungarian newspapers and magazines protested against the law by publishing editions with front pages left blank . the legislation will come into force on january 1 , the same day hungary begins its six-month presidency of the european council .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.12.2010 critics question lidl 's call for 10-euro minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl pays its employees at least 10 euros an hour lidl has surprised germany by calling for a 10-euro -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- minimum hourly wage for retail workers – that 's higher than the level being demanded by trade unions .
critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.12.2010 critics question lidl 's call for 10-euro minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl pays its employees at least 10 euros an hour lidl has surprised germany by calling for a 10-euro -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- minimum hourly wage for retail workers – that 's higher than the level being demanded by trade unions .
critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one group says the genetic variety of wild crops could help adapt them to the future . domesticated varieties of rice , wheat , maize and potatoes make up much of the world 's food crops and are bred to thrive under certain conditions . however , some experts warn that these crops could become vulnerable to global warming as optimal conditions change across the planet . climate change is expected to have multiple impacts on agricultural productivity , especially in areas of the developing world that are already experiencing high levels of food insecurity . for example , in southern africa , the yields for maize , a vital crop in a region already suffering from chronic hunger , are predicted to fall by up to 30 percent within just 20 years . a growing population will put added pressure on the food supply .
the world 's population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 , which will require an estimated 70 percent increase in global agricultural production , according to the united nation 's food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- . making use of the genetic variety contained in wild crops – the ancestors of today 's food crops – could help secure the world 's food supply by helping modern crops adapt to climate change , according to the global crop diversity trust . tough ancestors for a harsh climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild seeds have the traits needed to deal with climate change , fowler said in partnership with the millennium seed bank of the royal botanic gardens at kew , england , the consultative group on international agricultural research , and $ 50 million -lrb- 38 million euros -rrb- of funding from the government of norway , the trust has launched a campaign to collect , save and utilize these wild plants . the wild ancestors of today 's food crops were typically very tough and able to grow in conditions that are hostile for today 's agriculture , according to cary fowler , executive director of the global crop diversity trust . " some of them are extremely heat resistant or drought tolerant , " he said .
" if you look forward and consider the kind of projections being made in terms of climate change , these are exactly the kind of qualities agricultural crops will need in the near future . " biodiversity : a life-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding the right wild relative makes crops more robust new climates will affect agriculture within the next 50 years , fowler said . plants will have to adapt to variable temperatures , droughts , floods or different pests and diseases .
he pointed to rice as an example of where wild crop varieties could benefit modern crops . at a critical stage in the flowering process for rice , even a one-degree rise in temperature could cut yields by 10 percent . most high-yield varieties of rice flower during the heat of the day and a few degrees temperature change could cut yields by up to 40 percent , fowler said . but some wild rice relatives flower at night and if that characteristic could be incorporated into farmed rice it could save millions of tons of rice " and thousands of lives , " said fowler . the wild relatives of today 's food crops make up only a tiny fraction of the seeds currently held in the world 's gene banks . although plant breeders have incorporated many traits from the wild versions of crops in the past , the resulting plants have never been comprehensively collected or conserved , according to the global crop diversity trust . many are in danger because of climate change or rapid habitat loss .
the royal botanic gardens , kew , estimated that a fifth of the world 's plants are threatened with extinction . " diversity equals resilience in the biological world , which is why this project is vital to the survival of agriculture , " said paul smith , director of kew 's millennium seed bank . wild plants : a good investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maize is another crop that could suffer under climate change wild crop forms annually contribute more than $ 100 billion to commercial agriculture , according to fowler 's estimates . one example cited by the global crop diversity trust of how a " wild relative " can save a modern crop goes back to the 1970s , when rice harvests across asia were hit by an outbreak of grassy stunt virus . scientists screened more than 10,000 samples of wild and locally cultivated rice plants for resistance to the disease and found it in a wild relative , oryza nivara , growing in india .
the gene has been incorporated into most new varieties since that discovery . norwegian minister of the environment and international development erik solheim said the project represented " one of the most concrete steps taken to date to ensure that agriculture and humanity , adapts to climate change .
at a more fundamental level , the project also demonstrates the importance of biodiversity and genetic resources for human survival . " solheim added that the scandinavian country , which provided the trust 's initial funding , is committed to conserving the world 's plant biodiversity and built the svalbard global seed vault on the arctic island of spitsbergen in 2008 , to store seed samples safely for posterity . a race against time bildunterschrift : it can take 10 years until new seeds are available the international campaign will involve research centers , agricultural institutes , botanical gardens and local people around the globe , who will search out the plants and collect them . the project is focusing on 23 crops considered to be the most important food crops , including rice , wheat , maize , potatoes , beans and peas .
the time scale is 10 years , as the wild plants collected can not be used directly in modern agriculture and because it takes seven to 10 years to breed a new crop variety . " you have to cross the plant with a domesticated form to see what characteristics it actually has : drought resistance , heat resistance during flowering good pest or disease resistance , " explained fowler .
" you ca n't plant the wild plants , farmers want domesticated , higher yield varieties and so somehow traits from these wild plants have to be used in the process of making new , more modern varieties . " the results will be entered into a database and made available to plant-breeders and any other interested parties around the globe . ultimately , the seeds will be used to produce crop varieties that can cope with climate change . the project is a race against time .
a rapidly rising population and increased demand for meat means global agriculture production will have to double in the next 50 years , said fowler , adding that if climate change continues in line with the most conservative estimates it would be difficult to keep up current agriculture output . he described climate change as the biggest challenge agriculture has faced in the last 12,000 years .
and the partners in the campaign believe the natural diversity in older varieties , the " wild relatives , " will be the most important tool in addressing the challenge of future food security . author : irene quaile , sean sinico editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" biodiversity : a life-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding the right wild relative makes crops more robust new climates will affect agriculture within the next 50 years , fowler said . plants will have to adapt to variable temperatures , droughts , floods or different pests and diseases .
he pointed to rice as an example of where wild crop varieties could benefit modern crops . at a critical stage in the flowering process for rice , even a one-degree rise in temperature could cut yields by 10 percent . most high-yield varieties of rice flower during the heat of the day and a few degrees temperature change could cut yields by up to 40 percent , fowler said . but some wild rice relatives flower at night and if that characteristic could be incorporated into farmed rice it could save millions of tons of rice " and thousands of lives , " said fowler . the wild relatives of today 's food crops make up only a tiny fraction of the seeds currently held in the world 's gene banks . although plant breeders have incorporated many traits from the wild versions of crops in the past , the resulting plants have never been comprehensively collected or conserved , according to the global crop diversity trust . many are in danger because of climate change or rapid habitat loss .
the royal botanic gardens , kew , estimated that a fifth of the world 's plants are threatened with extinction . " diversity equals resilience in the biological world , which is why this project is vital to the survival of agriculture , " said paul smith , director of kew 's millennium seed bank . wild plants : a good investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maize is another crop that could suffer under climate change wild crop forms annually contribute more than $ 100 billion to commercial agriculture , according to fowler 's estimates . one example cited by the global crop diversity trust of how a " wild relative " can save a modern crop goes back to the 1970s , when rice harvests across asia were hit by an outbreak of grassy stunt virus . scientists screened more than 10,000 samples of wild and locally cultivated rice plants for resistance to the disease and found it in a wild relative , oryza nivara , growing in india .
the gene has been incorporated into most new varieties since that discovery . norwegian minister of the environment and international development erik solheim said the project represented " one of the most concrete steps taken to date to ensure that agriculture and humanity , adapts to climate change .
at a more fundamental level , the project also demonstrates the importance of biodiversity and genetic resources for human survival . " solheim added that the scandinavian country , which provided the trust 's initial funding , is committed to conserving the world 's plant biodiversity and built the svalbard global seed vault on the arctic island of spitsbergen in 2008 , to store seed samples safely for posterity . a race against time bildunterschrift : it can take 10 years until new seeds are available the international campaign will involve research centers , agricultural institutes , botanical gardens and local people around the globe , who will search out the plants and collect them . the project is focusing on 23 crops considered to be the most important food crops , including rice , wheat , maize , potatoes , beans and peas .
the time scale is 10 years , as the wild plants collected can not be used directly in modern agriculture and because it takes seven to 10 years to breed a new crop variety . " you have to cross the plant with a domesticated form to see what characteristics it actually has : drought resistance , heat resistance during flowering good pest or disease resistance , " explained fowler .
" you ca n't plant the wild plants , farmers want domesticated , higher yield varieties and so somehow traits from these wild plants have to be used in the process of making new , more modern varieties . " the results will be entered into a database and made available to plant-breeders and any other interested parties around the globe . ultimately , the seeds will be used to produce crop varieties that can cope with climate change . the project is a race against time .
a rapidly rising population and increased demand for meat means global agriculture production will have to double in the next 50 years , said fowler , adding that if climate change continues in line with the most conservative estimates it would be difficult to keep up current agriculture output . he described climate change as the biggest challenge agriculture has faced in the last 12,000 years .
and the partners in the campaign believe the natural diversity in older varieties , the " wild relatives , " will be the most important tool in addressing the challenge of future food security . author : irene quaile , sean sinico editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a majority of 64 percent say they celebrate christmas alongside other important occasions .
nineteen percent regard christmas as the most significant holiday of the year .
bildunterschrift : under soviet rule , the communist regime suppressed religion and marginalized christmas , instead focusing on the new year as the main holiday of the year .
after the fall of communism , christian celebrations and the christian orthodox religion came back into favor , as many russians turned to the church and religion in the wake of political turmoil in the 1990s .
many russians are religious the deutsche welle poll found that just under a third of russians - 29 percent - consider themselves religious , with most of those saying they go to church on holidays like christmas .
three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .
bildunterschrift : according to the poll , many young people are religious , with just 16 percent of russians under the age of 29 saying they do not believe in god .
russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .
bildunterschrift : but according to the deutsche welle poll , many russians would support a closer relationship between the two churches .
almost half of those polled are in favor of a meeting between the pope benedict xvi and kyrill i. forty percent say they are neutral on this issue .
a small minority of just 2 percent are opposed to such a meeting .
the ifak institute surveyed 1,000 russians in december 2010 .
the margin of error is no more than 3 percent .

the european commission has criticized the industry 's response to the snow and ice . the german travel industry is looking to mobilize and clear its growing backlog of international and domestic travelers whose holiday plans have been disrupted by days of heavy snow and ice . plane and train operators are hopeful that the travel freeze will begin to thaw on wednesday . the country 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it intended to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule on wednesday , after days of delays , cancellations and other disruptions .
for almost a week , lufthansa has been running a skeleton service in response to the snow and ice across much of europe , but spokesman thomas jachnow told reporters that wednesday 's promising weather forecast had enabled the airline to plan to run more planes . flights to the particularly hard-hit british hub london heathrow , however , would probably remain subject to delays or cancellations , jachnow said . lufthansa 's domestic services are not expected to return to normal yet , and the airline is still advising domestic travelers to seek alternative transportation if possible .

deutsche bahn intends to concentrate on some of its busiest north-south and east-west routes , pulling some of its high speed trains away from less busy lines in a bid to meet demand .
huber said that roughly 50,000 extra passengers per day were seeking long-distance train tickets over the holidays . on tuesday , long-distance deutsche bahn trains faced average delays of between 20 and 25 minutes , and some services were canceled altogether .

kallas was particularly critical of the snow-clearing infrastructure available to airports , describing this as the " weak link " in the chain . air travel hit hardest eurocontrol , the european air traffic supervisory body , said about 3,000 flights had been canceled across the continent on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days . frankfurt airport was forced to shut down entirely early on tuesday after heavy snowfall overnight ; roughly 400 flights were eventually canceled and hundreds more delayed . london heathrow , europe 's largest airport , canceled around two-thirds of all flights on tuesday .

now some conservative politicians are accusing berlin 's left-wing government of ignoring the late us president 's 100th birthday . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called on berlin to name a street or square after the late american president ronald reagan .
" a street named after this great honorary citizen would be very welcome , " he told the mass-circulation daily newspaper bild .
guttenberg added that berlin 's public expression of gratefulness should not end with rudi dutschke , a leading figure of the german left-wing students ' movement in the 1960s who had a street named after him by the capital 's left-wing government in 2008 .
politicians from the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- supported guttenberg 's call , with cdu foreign policy spokesman ruprecht polenz telling bild he did not think german reunification would have happened at all without reagan .
" ronald reagan brought down the iron curtain with his persistency in deed and clarity in speech , " he said , criticizing the berlin senate for not planning any official memorial service for reagan 's birthday .
" germany and especially berlin have a lot to thank ronald reagan for , " added berlin fdp parliamentarian martin lindner .
the nation 's capital should " permanently remember this great friend of germany in a visible area . "
linder suggested in 2004 that berlin rename the plaza in front of berlin 's central train station from washington-platz in honor of reagan .
reagan gave an iconic speech in front of the brandenburg gate in 1987 , which at the time was part of the border between east and west berlin , in which he called on the then-leader of the soviet union mikhail gorbachev , to tear down the berlin wall .
the latest discussion comes just weeks ahead of what would be reagan 's 100th birthday - on february 6 .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that could be the job ad posted every year in the search for santas .
across germany , companies turn to students to stick on beards and spread the holiday spirit . " do you have a moment ? "
santa asks a shopper in a busy store in the western germany city of bonn .
in the days before christmas , even santa has to ask politely .
after all , christmas time is shopping time .
but for santa , with his goody-filled sack , most people are happy to pause a moment . resplendent in his red velvet trousers and jacket , heavy black boots and , of course , the warm santa claus hat , christoph chapman has spent three hours at work this afternoon , in a large department store in downtown bonn . " the costume is very itchy , especially the beard , " he admitted . only the tall and round need apply normally , chapman studies political science and history in bonn .
but today he is santa claus .
he makes his way throughout the store , handing out apples , chocolate and stuffed animals to children and parents .
in his wake is a palpable sense of relief from the pre-christmas stress , and that is why the job is so fun , according to chapman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the student affairs association posts christmas jobs online chapman 's girlfriend found the job advertisement among the web pages of an online job site for bonn students .
the only requirements were a friendly attitude and certain santa claus-esque attributes . " actually , i still needed a big belly , but my girlfriend would n't have liked that , " chapman said , laughing . high demand positions as early as october businesses and families started looking for students to fill positions surrounding the holiday season .
santas and angels are in particularly high demand for company events , marketing campaigns or the giving of gifts on christmas eve .
also sought after are christmas tree vendors and employees to man the stalls for the many christmas markets . " these are well-paid jobs for which you need no special skills , " said mirjam von der mark , a marketing manager at studentenwerk bonn , a student services association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other jobs during the season are to be found at the christmas market in berlin the work placement of santa and his helpers by studentenwerk has been around since 1949 .
last year alone students made up the 500 santas and 50 angels who brought gifts to families in berlin and brandenburg . in order to ensure the recruits can ho-ho-ho correctly , students in berlin can attend workshops on the fundamentals of santa claus and angels .
the official angels and santa claus guidelines recommend being , " child-loving , innovative , and reliable . " " it 's cold , but it 's fun ! " jennifer bohne , however , does n't need a workshop for her job .
the 23-year-old student works at the bonn christmas market .
for five weeks she 's been standing behind the counter selling toasted almonds and cashews in small bags . " it 's cold , but it 's fun , " bohne said , adding that next year she 'll definitely be back . but whoever wants one of these coveted christmas jobs has to be quick .
finding applicants for an inventory job can sometimes be a tough affair , marketing manager mirjam von der mark said .
but she said the jobs disappear faster than fresh-baked christmas cookies . " as soon as the ad is online , my phone rings off the hook , " she said . author : svenja ueing -lrb- sjt -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now a german daily has claimed that the majority of german sinologists kowtow to china . many countries defied chinese diplomatic pressure earlier this month , by sending an envoy to the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo for the chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
many western intellectuals applauded when liu , who is serving an 11-year jail term , was proclaimed this year ’ s nobel peace laureate .
politicians from all over the world demanded his immediate release .
but journalist and china expert kai strittmatter said there was a conspicuous silence among germany ’ s sinologists .
bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is the first chinese citizen to ever receive a nobel prize " even though they are focusing their attention on modern china more and more , a chinese citizen gets a nobel prize for the first time , and they say almost nothing , " he said .
" that ’ s strange and the question is why ? "
some german sinologists depend on beijing in a recent article in the sueddeutsche zeitung , strittmatter argued that german sinologists had stayed mum because their jobs were partly dependent on the chinese government .
he pointed out that two professorships at goettingen university were sponsored by beijing .
meanwhile , jörg-meinhard rudolph from the university of applied sciences in ludwigshafen said that that some german sinologists feared future research projects could be jeopardized if they were to displease the chinese authorities .
" they are interested in doing research in china .
chinese academics can conduct research independently in germany , " he explained .
" but foreign , german or european academics in china can not work alone .
they need so-called partners . "
influence of confucius institutes the connection between the chinese departments of german universities and confucius institutes has also come under scrutiny .
there are 11 confucius institutes located in german universities .
these establishments are the chinese equivalent of the goethe institute or british council , promoting chinese culture and language abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many see the confucius institutes as a chinese soft-power tool many of the staff employed to teach chinese language courses are financed by beijing .
some critics say that china has thus been influencing the direction of chinese studies in germany .
political minefield for german sinologist susanne weigelin-schwiedrzik , who is the head of vienna university ’ s chinese department , " every single scholar has to make his or her position very clear because this is a highly-sensitive political minefield . "
" the best thing to do is keep a distance .
i work with chinese academics but i always make it clear to them that my research is not dependent on them , " she said .
although she also acknowledged that freedom of speech included a scholar ’ s right to remain silent on certain issues , but also thought academics do bear some responsibility as public figures .
" i am of the opinion that i am morally obliged - as someone who is open and has a view of the world and as a european intellectual - to observe and analyze the world , from beyond my academic sphere . " after all the public criticism in the media , it will be interesting to see whether more german china experts remember this the next time a chinese dissident is awarded a prize .

blocked freeways have cut off supply lines for car manufacturers , gas stations and delivery companies . in snow-covered germany , trying to get around on streets that have n't been salted is next to impossible , and road salt company k + s is benefitting from the increase in demand .
their stock on the german exchange dax has risen significantly in the last few days .
in other branches of the economy , however , the hard winter is turning into a serious problem .
" production in the german construction industry is at a standstill , " said heiko stiepelmann from a building industry group .
excavation , road works , and building construction have especially taken a hit . "
the construction industry is facing its second battle with winter weather in 2010 .
in the first three months of the year the sector was faced with similar problems of snow and ice .
" if it repeats itself at the end of the year , we 'll hardly be able to record a profit , " said stiepelmann .
economy remains thawed the construction industry is n't alone in feeling the sting of the cold and snowy weather .
companies are postponing business trips .
restaurants and stores are suffering as customers find it difficult to get around .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer shoppers are braving the weather " the harsh and early winter is stunting economic growth at the end of the year , " said volker treier , lead economist of the german chamber of commerce .
last winter cost economic growth a half percentage point , and treier says this winter is pushing things in a similar direction .
" but the general economic boom is too strong to be held back by a hard winter , " he added .
car problems the ford car factory in cologne was another victim of the winter conditions .
production was stopped last week because a delivery of heaters could n't be made on time .
" the heaters are from a factory in northern france , but france and belgium closed the freeways for semi-trucks that weighed more than seven and a half tons , " said bernd meier , ford 's press officer at the factory in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many deliveries did n't even make it to the freeway the opel factory in bochum faced shortages of certain car parts , but the finished cars could still be completed on time .
blocked or closed highways have limited deliveries of fuel to gas stations , leading to a shortage in some parts of germany .
the oil company esso reported that 20 german gas stations were completely out of gas .
icy roads kept fuel trucks from leaving at shell oil refineries .
race against the clock the timing of this particular cold snap is especially problematic for logistics companies hoping to deliver christmas presents on time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting gifts delivered on time could be a challenge christine hoeger , a spokeswoman for the online shopping portal amazon , said delivery of packages could be delayed by up to two days .
dhl was a little more optimistic for its christmas deliveries .
" we 're assuming that we can deliver all packages that reach us by midday on december 22 on time for christmas , " said claus korfmacher , a dhl spokesman in bonn .
despite the guarantee , getting presents under the christmas tree on time this year in germany could prove to be a challenge .

but now a german daily has claimed that the majority of german sinologists kowtow to china . many countries defied chinese diplomatic pressure earlier this month , by sending an envoy to the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo for the chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
many western intellectuals applauded when liu , who is serving an 11-year jail term , was proclaimed this year ’ s nobel peace laureate .
politicians from all over the world demanded his immediate release .
but journalist and china expert kai strittmatter said there was a conspicuous silence among germany ’ s sinologists .
bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is the first chinese citizen to ever receive a nobel prize " even though they are focusing their attention on modern china more and more , a chinese citizen gets a nobel prize for the first time , and they say almost nothing , " he said .
" that ’ s strange and the question is why ? "
some german sinologists depend on beijing in a recent article in the sueddeutsche zeitung , strittmatter argued that german sinologists had stayed mum because their jobs were partly dependent on the chinese government .
he pointed out that two professorships at goettingen university were sponsored by beijing .
meanwhile , jörg-meinhard rudolph from the university of applied sciences in ludwigshafen said that that some german sinologists feared future research projects could be jeopardized if they were to displease the chinese authorities .
" they are interested in doing research in china .
chinese academics can conduct research independently in germany , " he explained .
" but foreign , german or european academics in china can not work alone .
they need so-called partners . "
influence of confucius institutes the connection between the chinese departments of german universities and confucius institutes has also come under scrutiny .
there are 11 confucius institutes located in german universities .
these establishments are the chinese equivalent of the goethe institute or british council , promoting chinese culture and language abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many see the confucius institutes as a chinese soft-power tool many of the staff employed to teach chinese language courses are financed by beijing .
some critics say that china has thus been influencing the direction of chinese studies in germany .
political minefield for german sinologist susanne weigelin-schwiedrzik , who is the head of vienna university ’ s chinese department , " every single scholar has to make his or her position very clear because this is a highly-sensitive political minefield . "
" the best thing to do is keep a distance .
i work with chinese academics but i always make it clear to them that my research is not dependent on them , " she said .
although she also acknowledged that freedom of speech included a scholar ’ s right to remain silent on certain issues , but also thought academics do bear some responsibility as public figures .
" i am of the opinion that i am morally obliged - as someone who is open and has a view of the world and as a european intellectual - to observe and analyze the world , from beyond my academic sphere . " after all the public criticism in the media , it will be interesting to see whether more german china experts remember this the next time a chinese dissident is awarded a prize .

this comes after 11 republicans broke rank with their party , giving president obama the two-thirds senate majority he would need for ratification .
however this has been anything but plain sailing for the president .
earlier this year , mitt romney , generally considered to be a leading republican contender for the 2012 us presidential election , chose an op-ed in the washington post to pour scorn on the so-called new start arms reduction treaty negotiated by the obama administration with russia . under the headline " obama 's worst foreign policy mistake , " romney , who lost the republican nomination for the 2008 presidential election to john mccain , did n't mince words .
arguing that the treaty was badly negotiated by the obama administration and that it puts us security at stake , he called it a non-starter that must not be ratified . sico van der meer , an arms control expert at the netherlands institute of international relations , does n't think romney 's op-ed had much merit : " in my opinion he is completely wrong , " he told deutsche welle .
" the republicans ask why should the russians reduce less than we should ?
i think this is a debate you can have , but in my opinion and i think for most people in europe the amount of warheads that will be reduced through the start treaty is very low anyway , so i do n't think there should be any problems with this treaty . "
better than nothing kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and now managing director of the center on transatlantic relations at the johns hopkins university , offers a more nuanced take on romney 's piece : " i read the romney piece and i thought the criticism there was very very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney is eyeing another presidential bid in 2012 the new start treaty is certainly no breakthrough , argues volker .
" the treaty itself does n't do a whole lot , it does n't reduce numbers that much .
in fact by some analysis it may even give some headroom to the russians on what they can do based on the counting rules . "
in addition , the deal also does n't improve access for verification and inspections and excludes the large stockpile of russia 's tactical nuclear weapons , adds volker .
" but what it does do is it establishes a legal framework around the strategic nuclear weapons that exist , " says volker .
" on balance that is probably a good thing to do rather than a bad thing to do . "
while the new pact is mostly regarded as an important follow-up to the expired start treaty , most experts consider it a modest step rather than an ambitious leap toward nuclear disarmament .
it will cut the number of deployed nuclear weapons by some 25 percent .
each side would be limited to 800 armed launchers .
the agreement also envisages slashing the number of nuclear warheads within the next seven years to 1,550 from currently 2,200 , which goes beyond a previous planned cut to 1,700 .
by most accounts the us may need to phase out more weapons than the russian side .
sico van der meer would have wanted a much more aggressive arms reduction pact , but he agrees with volker that this deal is better than no deal at all .
slow progress " europeans support the treaty not only because they are afraid of nuclear war , " he says .
" i do n't think that is really a possibility at the moment .
but the more weapons there are , the more risks there are for accidents or thefts of nuclear weapons by terrorists for example .
to reduce those risks is very important for europe , but also for the whole world . " # bwhile there are ultimately good reasons to pass the start treaty , volker remains deeply skeptical about the prospects for future arms reduction . " it generally cheers european hearts to see that arms control is moving ahead , " he says .
" i do n't think it is a harbinger of future success for arms control .
i do n't think the russians have any intentions of limiting their tactical nuclear weapons .
they have been very clear about that .
they have also pulled out of the cse treaty -lrb- conventional armed forces in europe - ed . -rrb- and i do n't see them going back into the cse .
so i do n't see this pointing the way ahead . "

the number of national and international information providers keeps growing .
arabic , chinese or russian broadcasters have broken through the west ’ s former dominance and are providing another perspective to the world .
what some may call a fairly-won election , others call a fraud .
in the battle to win opinions and the struggle of interpretive predominance , deutsche welle presents the german perspective on worldwide events .

now , 60 years after the founding of the federal republic of germany and 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall and the east-west conflict , “ détente ” has given way to intercultural dialogue .
over the years , deutsche welle gained a reputation as “ the voice of freedom ” – from the 1968 “ prague spring ” and the era of dictatorship in greece to the wars in the balkans and in chechnya to the current trouble spots in afghanistan and iraq .

it is also part of room service in tens of thousands of top-ranking hotels on every continent .
it ’ s available on the internet as a live stream , where many programs are also available as video on demand or as a podcast subscription . looking back dw-tv was launched in april 1992 .
germany ’ s international broadcaster evolved from rias tv in berlin during the course of german reunification .
initially , six hours of programming were broadcast via satellite .
only a few months later , the program was extended to 14 and then 16 hours .
spanish was added as a third language .
since 1995 , dw-tv has been broadcasting around the clock .
programming content and structure has been adapted and updated a number of times – a process that has always been guided by an efficient overall concept of the way germany ’ s media image is presented to the outside world .
the most radical change was dw-tv ’ s repositioning as of january 1 , 1999 .
since then , dw-tv has focused on news and information , with an additional spotlight on the arts and culture in general .
deutsche welle ’ s experience with global television goes back to 1963 .
that was when dw , then based in cologne , sent a foreign-language adaptation of a german film beyond germany ’ s borders for the first time .
the company transtel -lrb- today known as dw-transtel -rrb- was founded to transcribe and distribute german tv productions .
as one of the shareholders , dw took charge of the selection and adaptation of the programs , as well as the acquisition of foreign rights .
from 1983 , dw began producing television programs on its own .
in 1998 , transtel was closed down and its tasks were fully integrated into dw but the brand dw-transtel remained .
in this way , hundreds of hours of programming continue to go out to the world every year in many languages .
programs are adapted in and dispatched from berlin . september 2010 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

extended train services were meant to help clear the backlog in germany . frankfurt airport was open and running at close to full capacity on wednesday .
seventy flights were canceled out of a scheduled 1,300 .
" the airport operation is getting back to normal , " airport spokesman thomas uber said .
" but it will take a while to catch up . "
there was a backlog of around 3,500 passengers at germany 's busiest hub .
a spokeswoman for london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , said it was operating 70 percent of a normal day 's service on wednesday .
both of heathrow 's runways were open again , but airport operator baa had said that it would need time to move diverted aircraft and crew into position .
british airways said it would only be operating around a third of its flights from heathrow until 6:00 a.m. on thursday .
germany 's biggest airline , lufthansa , announced on tuesday evening that it was preparing to return to a standard long-haul flight schedule , although domestic routes would still be disrupted .
the airline reported no problems on wednesday morning .
extra train services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : days of snow and ice have stopped travelers in their tracks airlines were still advising passengers to seek alternative transportation , as they tried to catch up after days of delayed and canceled services .
eurostar , the high-speed rail link between london , paris and brussels , said nine of its 52 trains would be canceled on wednesday , but that passengers would be given seats on the next available trains .
germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , was providing extra train services from wednesday to cope with the high level of demand .
a special long-distance timetable was to run until december 31 .
" we are considerably overburdened , " deutsche bahn board member berthold huber said .
the rail operator bahn planned to concentrate on its busy north-south and east-west routes , pulling some high speed trains away from quieter services . huber estimated that around 50,000 extra passengers per day were looking to make long-distance rail trips over the christmas period . days of travel disruption the european commission on tuesday criticized transport providers for not dealing well enough with the recent freezing weather conditions .
" i am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across europe caused by severe snow , " the european transport commissioner , siim kallas , said in a statement .
" it is unacceptable and should not happen again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free food and drink has been given out to passengers waiting at frankfurt kallas was particularly critical of airports , and said he would meet with air travel officials in the coming days to look into how they would ensure " minimum service requirements " were met in the future .
around 3,000 flights were canceled across europe on tuesday , with a similar amount of planes remaining grounded on each of the four previous days .
unexpected snowfall caused frankfurt airport to close for three hours on tuesday morning , while london heathrow canceled two-thirds of all flights .
charles de gaulle airport in paris and brussels-zavanthem airport also recorded numerous delays .

that could be the job ad posted every year in the search for santas .
across germany , companies turn to students to stick on beards and spread the holiday spirit . " do you have a moment ? "
santa asks a shopper in a busy store in the western germany city of bonn .
in the days before christmas , even santa has to ask politely .
after all , christmas time is shopping time .
but for santa , with his goody-filled sack , most people are happy to pause a moment . resplendent in his red velvet trousers and jacket , heavy black boots and , of course , the warm santa claus hat , christoph chapman has spent three hours at work this afternoon , in a large department store in downtown bonn . " the costume is very itchy , especially the beard , " he admitted . only the tall and round need apply normally , chapman studies political science and history in bonn .
but today he is santa claus .
he makes his way throughout the store , handing out apples , chocolate and stuffed animals to children and parents .
in his wake is a palpable sense of relief from the pre-christmas stress , and that is why the job is so fun , according to chapman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the student affairs association posts christmas jobs online chapman 's girlfriend found the job advertisement among the web pages of an online job site for bonn students .
the only requirements were a friendly attitude and certain santa claus-esque attributes . " actually , i still needed a big belly , but my girlfriend would n't have liked that , " chapman said , laughing . high demand positions as early as october businesses and families started looking for students to fill positions surrounding the holiday season .
santas and angels are in particularly high demand for company events , marketing campaigns or the giving of gifts on christmas eve .
also sought after are christmas tree vendors and employees to man the stalls for the many christmas markets . " these are well-paid jobs for which you need no special skills , " said mirjam von der mark , a marketing manager at studentenwerk bonn , a student services association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other jobs during the season are to be found at the christmas market in berlin the work placement of santa and his helpers by studentenwerk has been around since 1949 .
last year alone students made up the 500 santas and 50 angels who brought gifts to families in berlin and brandenburg . in order to ensure the recruits can ho-ho-ho correctly , students in berlin can attend workshops on the fundamentals of santa claus and angels .
the official angels and santa claus guidelines recommend being , " child-loving , innovative , and reliable . " " it 's cold , but it 's fun ! " jennifer bohne , however , does n't need a workshop for her job .
the 23-year-old student works at the bonn christmas market .
for five weeks she 's been standing behind the counter selling toasted almonds and cashews in small bags . " it 's cold , but it 's fun , " bohne said , adding that next year she 'll definitely be back . but whoever wants one of these coveted christmas jobs has to be quick .
finding applicants for an inventory job can sometimes be a tough affair , marketing manager mirjam von der mark said .
but she said the jobs disappear faster than fresh-baked christmas cookies .

one group says the genetic variety of wild crops could help adapt them to the future . domesticated varieties of rice , wheat , maize and potatoes make up much of the world 's food crops and are bred to thrive under certain conditions . however , some experts warn that these crops could become vulnerable to global warming as optimal conditions change across the planet . climate change is expected to have multiple impacts on agricultural productivity , especially in areas of the developing world that are already experiencing high levels of food insecurity . for example , in southern africa , the yields for maize , a vital crop in a region already suffering from chronic hunger , are predicted to fall by up to 30 percent within just 20 years . a growing population will put added pressure on the food supply .
the world 's population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 , which will require an estimated 70 percent increase in global agricultural production , according to the united nation 's food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- . making use of the genetic variety contained in wild crops – the ancestors of today 's food crops – could help secure the world 's food supply by helping modern crops adapt to climate change , according to the global crop diversity trust . tough ancestors for a harsh climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild seeds have the traits needed to deal with climate change , fowler said in partnership with the millennium seed bank of the royal botanic gardens at kew , england , the consultative group on international agricultural research , and $ 50 million -lrb- 38 million euros -rrb- of funding from the government of norway , the trust has launched a campaign to collect , save and utilize these wild plants . the wild ancestors of today 's food crops were typically very tough and able to grow in conditions that are hostile for today 's agriculture , according to cary fowler , executive director of the global crop diversity trust . " some of them are extremely heat resistant or drought tolerant , " he said .
" if you look forward and consider the kind of projections being made in terms of climate change , these are exactly the kind of qualities agricultural crops will need in the near future . " biodiversity : a life-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding the right wild relative makes crops more robust new climates will affect agriculture within the next 50 years , fowler said . plants will have to adapt to variable temperatures , droughts , floods or different pests and diseases .
he pointed to rice as an example of where wild crop varieties could benefit modern crops . at a critical stage in the flowering process for rice , even a one-degree rise in temperature could cut yields by 10 percent . most high-yield varieties of rice flower during the heat of the day and a few degrees temperature change could cut yields by up to 40 percent , fowler said . but some wild rice relatives flower at night and if that characteristic could be incorporated into farmed rice it could save millions of tons of rice " and thousands of lives , " said fowler . the wild relatives of today 's food crops make up only a tiny fraction of the seeds currently held in the world 's gene banks . although plant breeders have incorporated many traits from the wild versions of crops in the past , the resulting plants have never been comprehensively collected or conserved , according to the global crop diversity trust . many are in danger because of climate change or rapid habitat loss .
the royal botanic gardens , kew , estimated that a fifth of the world 's plants are threatened with extinction . " diversity equals resilience in the biological world , which is why this project is vital to the survival of agriculture , " said paul smith , director of kew 's millennium seed bank . wild plants : a good investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maize is another crop that could suffer under climate change wild crop forms annually contribute more than $ 100 billion to commercial agriculture , according to fowler 's estimates . one example cited by the global crop diversity trust of how a " wild relative " can save a modern crop goes back to the 1970s , when rice harvests across asia were hit by an outbreak of grassy stunt virus . scientists screened more than 10,000 samples of wild and locally cultivated rice plants for resistance to the disease and found it in a wild relative , oryza nivara , growing in india .
the gene has been incorporated into most new varieties since that discovery . norwegian minister of the environment and international development erik solheim said the project represented " one of the most concrete steps taken to date to ensure that agriculture and humanity , adapts to climate change .
at a more fundamental level , the project also demonstrates the importance of biodiversity and genetic resources for human survival . " solheim added that the scandinavian country , which provided the trust 's initial funding , is committed to conserving the world 's plant biodiversity and built the svalbard global seed vault on the arctic island of spitsbergen in 2008 , to store seed samples safely for posterity . a race against time bildunterschrift : it can take 10 years until new seeds are available the international campaign will involve research centers , agricultural institutes , botanical gardens and local people around the globe , who will search out the plants and collect them . the project is focusing on 23 crops considered to be the most important food crops , including rice , wheat , maize , potatoes , beans and peas .
the time scale is 10 years , as the wild plants collected can not be used directly in modern agriculture and because it takes seven to 10 years to breed a new crop variety . " you have to cross the plant with a domesticated form to see what characteristics it actually has : drought resistance , heat resistance during flowering good pest or disease resistance , " explained fowler .
" you ca n't plant the wild plants , farmers want domesticated , higher yield varieties and so somehow traits from these wild plants have to be used in the process of making new , more modern varieties . " the results will be entered into a database and made available to plant-breeders and any other interested parties around the globe . ultimately , the seeds will be used to produce crop varieties that can cope with climate change . the project is a race against time .
a rapidly rising population and increased demand for meat means global agriculture production will have to double in the next 50 years , said fowler , adding that if climate change continues in line with the most conservative estimates it would be difficult to keep up current agriculture output . he described climate change as the biggest challenge agriculture has faced in the last 12,000 years .
and the partners in the campaign believe the natural diversity in older varieties , the " wild relatives , " will be the most important tool in addressing the challenge of future food security . author : irene quaile , sean sinico editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schalke 's win caps an impressive recent run , and prompted coach felix magath to grant his players more time off over christmas . schalke won their last match of 2010 , beating german second division leaders augsburg 1-0 in the german cup .
the victory secured the royal blues a place in the quarter-finals , and it also earned them a longer christmas holiday .
last month coach felix magath , angered by his club 's dreadful start to the season , had curtailed the players ' vacation time , ordering them back to training on december 27 .
" i 'm very satisfied , and that 's why we 'll all have a break until january 2 , " magath told reporters after the match in augsburg .
" i 'm satisfied with my team 's performance .
it was a tough task , especially considering the condition of the pitch . "
in all competitions , schalke have now won five consecutive games .
after weeks in the relegation zone , they are up to a solid 10th in the bundesliga , and they 're through to the knockout stages of the lucrative champions ' league .
tuesday 's win on a snow-covered augsburg pitch was by no means easy , and it took schalke 84 minutes to find the decisive goal .

senegalese forward demba ba scored hoffenheim 's second on 63 minutes , a short range finish from a sejad salihovic corner that three gladbach defenders failed to clear .
as well as securing them a spot in the last eight , the win broke a run of four consecutive draws for hoffenheim , who have slipped back into mid-table in recent weeks after a very strong start to the season .
for gladbach , however , the result completes a rather miserable run leading up to the christmas holidays .
as well as dropping out of the german cup with this defeat , moenchengladbach go into the winter break rock bottom of the bundesliga , having also lost five consecutive league matches .

a majority of 64 percent say they celebrate christmas alongside other important occasions .
nineteen percent regard christmas as the most significant holiday of the year .
bildunterschrift : under soviet rule , the communist regime suppressed religion and marginalized christmas , instead focusing on the new year as the main holiday of the year .
after the fall of communism , christian celebrations and the christian orthodox religion came back into favor , as many russians turned to the church and religion in the wake of political turmoil in the 1990s .
many russians are religious the deutsche welle poll found that just under a third of russians - 29 percent - consider themselves religious , with most of those saying they go to church on holidays like christmas .
three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .
bildunterschrift : according to the poll , many young people are religious , with just 16 percent of russians under the age of 29 saying they do not believe in god .
russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .
bildunterschrift : but according to the deutsche welle poll , many russians would support a closer relationship between the two churches .
almost half of those polled are in favor of a meeting between the pope benedict xvi and kyrill i. forty percent say they are neutral on this issue .
a small minority of just 2 percent are opposed to such a meeting .
the ifak institute surveyed 1,000 russians in december 2010 .
the margin of error is no more than 3 percent .

" the airport operation is getting back to normal , " airport spokesman thomas uber said .
" but it will take a while to catch up . "
there was a backlog of around 3,500 passengers at germany 's busiest hub .
a spokeswoman for london heathrow , europe 's busiest airport , said it was operating 70 percent of a normal day 's service on wednesday .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.12.2010 critics question lidl 's call for 10-euro minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl pays its employees at least 10 euros an hour lidl has surprised germany by calling for a 10-euro -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- minimum hourly wage for retail workers – that 's higher than the level being demanded by trade unions .
critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.12.2010 critics question lidl 's call for 10-euro minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl pays its employees at least 10 euros an hour lidl has surprised germany by calling for a 10-euro -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- minimum hourly wage for retail workers – that 's higher than the level being demanded by trade unions .
critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three percent say they are deeply religious .
merely 11 percent of those polled consider themselves atheist and six percent say they are not religious but observe christian traditions like christenings and church weddings .

russians in favor of dialogue with roman catholic church the relationship between the christian orthodox and the roman catholic churches has always been fraught with conflict , which is why there has never been a meeting between the roman catholic pope and the russian patriarch , the head of the russian orthodox church .

almost half of those polled are in favor of a meeting between the pope benedict xvi and kyrill i. forty percent say they are neutral on this issue .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said . " and you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered , " he said . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics suspect the supermarket chain has ulterior motives . " equal work – equal wages .
good work – fair pay . "
it could be a slogan scrawled across banners carried by disgruntled employees at a strike march .
in fact , the above motto comes from a statement released by juergen kisseberth , director of discount supermarket chain lidl in germany .
kisseberth 's catchphrase comes amid ongoing negotiations over a minimum wage for the 2.7 million people working in germany 's retail sector .
exploratory talks between service industry union verdi and the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- are set to end some time in january .
representatives have been weighing up an hourly base wage of somewhere between 7 euros -lrb- $ 9.20 -rrb- and 8.80 euros .
but now kisseberth has set a cat among the pigeons by proposing a much more radical rate of 10 euros .
" lidl is very interested in seeing the discussion on the minimum wage stay relevant on a political and social level , " kisseberth 's statement read .
" and that this discussion results in a fruitful and effective decision by law-makers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is currently in negotiations with hde over a new minimum wage this begs the question of what lidl has to gain by such an effective decision .
recent years have , after all , seen lidl come under fire for treating employees and suppliers poorly on a number of occasions .
" lidl has always supported the minimum wage , " lidl spokeswoman gertrud bott told deutsche welle .
" we already brought up the issue at the beginning of the year , without actually mentioning a concrete figure .
but we brought it up now because it is a political discussion at the moment . "
pressuring the competition some critics , such as ulrich schulte from die tageszeitung newspaper , suggest that the answer might lie in lidl 's own comparatively generous wage rates .
lidl has been paying all its workers – including part-timers – at least 10 euros an hour since march .
according to the company 's own data , nearly 50 percent of lidl employees receive 13 euros an hour .
if lidl 's competitors were forced to match these rates , they could easily find themselves having to restructure and re-think their business plans .
something similar happened at the beginning of 2008 , when a minimum wage was introduced for postal workers .
at 9.80 euros an hour , the new minimum lay well below that paid by deutsche post , which still enjoys a post-monopoly position of dominance .
other smaller postal operators such as pin and tnt , however , were forced to raise their wages .
pin declared insolvency not long later .
bott refused to be drawn on such speculations .
" we already pay that -lrb- 10 euros -rrb- , and we can only speak for ourselves , " she said . means or ends verdi , for its part , sees this discussion as somewhat abstract .
the trade union 's spokeswoman cornelia hass is not too fussy about the motivations of this surprising new ally .
" from our point of view , this is something that brings an advantage to many people , " she told deutsche welle .
" we could discuss philosophically whether the motivation is more crucial than the result .
but i do n't think tariff politics or negotiations should be so philosophical . "
" we welcome the statements .
we hope that this good example will be followed by other chains , " hass added .
" a lot of retailers think it 's acceptable to pay wages that their workers can not live on in order to keep a competitive edge .
lidl pays good wages but still has a good competitive position .
there really is no more convincing argument . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mros was sacked when it emerged that lidl had kept files on its workers there is also a suggestion that lidl is attempting to clean up its poor reputation concerning employees ' rights .
early last year , kisseberth 's predecessor frank-michael mros was sacked after it emerged that the chain had illegally collected private data on its employees , including the state of their health .
like many bargain supermarkets , lidl has also been accused of exploiting " sweat-shop " working conditions to produce cheap clothing in asia .
" lidl is not exactly a company that has been covered in glory when it comes to dealing with its employees , " admits hass .
" but now they are doing something that we welcome .
this is a positive signal , but they will have to go a lot further before you hear me calling them a model company . "
unhelpful intervention the german retail federation -lrb- hde -rrb- is understandably less happy with lidl 's contribution to the debate .
" we 've got nothing against it when companies speak out against low wages , but do have a different view of how this should be done , " hde spokesman heribert joeris said .
" we do n't believe in one unified minimum wage , but in branch specific minimum wages .
that way we can really agree on the right minimum wage depending on the industry and the region . "
across germany 's political spectrum , only the left party is calling for a single unified minimum wage in line with lidl 's vision .
the center-left social democrats and the green party do not support a single minimum wage of this scale . author : ben knight editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schalke 's win caps an impressive recent run , and prompted coach felix magath to grant his players more time off over christmas . schalke won their last match of 2010 , beating german second division leaders augsburg 1-0 in the german cup .
the victory secured the royal blues a place in the quarter-finals , and it also earned them a longer christmas holiday .
last month coach felix magath , angered by his club 's dreadful start to the season , had curtailed the players ' vacation time , ordering them back to training on december 27 .
" i 'm very satisfied , and that 's why we 'll all have a break until january 2 , " magath told reporters after the match in augsburg .
" i 'm satisfied with my team 's performance .
it was a tough task , especially considering the condition of the pitch . "
in all competitions , schalke have now won five consecutive games .
after weeks in the relegation zone , they are up to a solid 10th in the bundesliga , and they 're through to the knockout stages of the lucrative champions ' league .
tuesday 's win on a snow-covered augsburg pitch was by no means easy , and it took schalke 84 minutes to find the decisive goal .
veteran spanish striker raul , who has been the personification of schalke 's ice-cold turned red-hot season so far , did the hard work - taking on three defenders and then putting peruvian winger jefferson farfan through to score from the right flank .
hoffenheim pile more misery on moenchengladbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a good day for all the bundesliga 's boys in blue matches pitting offenbach against nuremberg and koblenz against kaiserslautern were both canceled due to bad weather conditions on tuesday , but in the second fixture that did go ahead , hoffenheim beat visitors borussia moenchengladbach 2-0 .
icelandic midfielder gylfi sigurdsson opened the scoring for hoffenheim with a trademark free-kick from just outside the area , but a lot of credit for the goal must go to moenchengladbach keeper christofer heimeroth .
instead of shooting over the wall , sigurdsson elected to try his luck on heimeroth 's side of the goal , but as he struck it the gladbach keeper dived away from his station towards the other side of the net in a spectacularly misguided gamble .
senegalese forward demba ba scored hoffenheim 's second on 63 minutes , a short range finish from a sejad salihovic corner that three gladbach defenders failed to clear .
as well as securing them a spot in the last eight , the win broke a run of four consecutive draws for hoffenheim , who have slipped back into mid-table in recent weeks after a very strong start to the season .
for gladbach , however , the result completes a rather miserable run leading up to the christmas holidays .
as well as dropping out of the german cup with this defeat , moenchengladbach go into the winter break rock bottom of the bundesliga , having also lost five consecutive league matches .
in wednesday 's german cup games - weather permitting - wolfsburg entertain cottbus , duisburg travel to cologne , aachen play host to frankfurt , and stuttgart face a tough home test against bayern munich .

that could be the job ad posted every year in the search for santas .
across germany , companies turn to students to stick on beards and spread the holiday spirit . " do you have a moment ? "
santa asks a shopper in a busy store in the western germany city of bonn .
in the days before christmas , even santa has to ask politely .
after all , christmas time is shopping time .
but for santa , with his goody-filled sack , most people are happy to pause a moment . resplendent in his red velvet trousers and jacket , heavy black boots and , of course , the warm santa claus hat , christoph chapman has spent three hours at work this afternoon , in a large department store in downtown bonn . " the costume is very itchy , especially the beard , " he admitted . only the tall and round need apply normally , chapman studies political science and history in bonn .
but today he is santa claus .
he makes his way throughout the store , handing out apples , chocolate and stuffed animals to children and parents .
in his wake is a palpable sense of relief from the pre-christmas stress , and that is why the job is so fun , according to chapman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the student affairs association posts christmas jobs online chapman 's girlfriend found the job advertisement among the web pages of an online job site for bonn students .

santas and angels are in particularly high demand for company events , marketing campaigns or the giving of gifts on christmas eve .

" these are well-paid jobs for which you need no special skills , " said mirjam von der mark , a marketing manager at studentenwerk bonn , a student services association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other jobs during the season are to be found at the christmas market in berlin the work placement of santa and his helpers by studentenwerk has been around since 1949 .
last year alone students made up the 500 santas and 50 angels who brought gifts to families in berlin and brandenburg . in order to ensure the recruits can ho-ho-ho correctly , students in berlin can attend workshops on the fundamentals of santa claus and angels .

the 23-year-old student works at the bonn christmas market .
for five weeks she 's been standing behind the counter selling toasted almonds and cashews in small bags . " it 's cold , but it 's fun , " bohne said , adding that next year she 'll definitely be back . but whoever wants one of these coveted christmas jobs has to be quick .

the data comes from a 41,000-year-old fossil . based on the 2008 discovery of a 41,000-year-old finger bone found in the denisova cave , in southern siberia , researchers now have a draft genome sequence of this human ancestor , according to a paper to be published thursday in the journal nature . a team led by svante paabo , a neanderthal expert and researcher the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , initially determined after its discovery that one sample located in a siberian cave belonged to a group of hominids related to neanderthals . " when they found this little pinky bone we were totally convinced that this was either a neanderthal or a modern human , " he told deutsche welle .
" we analyzed its mitochondrial dna and we published earlier this year a paper that showed that this was some separate form of extinct human . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svante paabo helped sequence the denisovan 's genome that first paper was published in march 2010 , however , the research team now says the new genome sequencing suggests there is genetic material related to that found in modern melanesia , a region extending north of australia , from papua new guinea to fiji . that strongly implies denisovans and melanesian ancestors reproduced together .
in fact , the paper shows that denisovan genetic material makes approximately 4 percent to 6 percent of modern-day melanesians in some cases . " the fact that they have contributed to people in papua new guinea , suggests that they were all over east asia at a time when neanderthals were in western eurasia , " paabo added . human evolution gets ' more complicated ' richard green , an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of california , santa cruz , in the united states , said the story of human evolution has become " a bit more complicated . " " instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of africa and replacing neanderthals , we now see these very intertwined storylines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before , " said green , who played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone fossil was found in russia paabo concurred , calling this finding “ exciting , " and saying that studying denisovans would become a new focus for him . " they are related to neanderthals , and i guess what it shows about our ancestors , when they came out of africa , they met different forms of humans , at least with two different groups , with the neanderthals and with denisovans , " he said . as scientists locate more genetic markers around asia , they may be able to discern where this ancient population once lived , and if they find enough fossils , they might be able to determine a morphology , or shape of those human ancestors . perhaps , later on , they might be able to locate artifacts or other clues that may reveal something about denisovans social structure , clothing or tools . " this study fills in some of the details , but we would like to know much more about the denisovans and their interactions with human populations , " green said .

this comes after 11 republicans broke rank with their party , giving president obama the two-thirds senate majority he would need for ratification .
however this has been anything but plain sailing for the president .
earlier this year , mitt romney , generally considered to be a leading republican contender for the 2012 us presidential election , chose an op-ed in the washington post to pour scorn on the so-called new start arms reduction treaty negotiated by the obama administration with russia . under the headline " obama 's worst foreign policy mistake , " romney , who lost the republican nomination for the 2008 presidential election to john mccain , did n't mince words .
arguing that the treaty was badly negotiated by the obama administration and that it puts us security at stake , he called it a non-starter that must not be ratified . sico van der meer , an arms control expert at the netherlands institute of international relations , does n't think romney 's op-ed had much merit : " in my opinion he is completely wrong , " he told deutsche welle .
" the republicans ask why should the russians reduce less than we should ?
i think this is a debate you can have , but in my opinion and i think for most people in europe the amount of warheads that will be reduced through the start treaty is very low anyway , so i do n't think there should be any problems with this treaty . "
better than nothing kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and now managing director of the center on transatlantic relations at the johns hopkins university , offers a more nuanced take on romney 's piece : " i read the romney piece and i thought the criticism there was very very strong . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican mitt romney is eyeing another presidential bid in 2012 the new start treaty is certainly no breakthrough , argues volker .
" the treaty itself does n't do a whole lot , it does n't reduce numbers that much .
in fact by some analysis it may even give some headroom to the russians on what they can do based on the counting rules . "
in addition , the deal also does n't improve access for verification and inspections and excludes the large stockpile of russia 's tactical nuclear weapons , adds volker .
" but what it does do is it establishes a legal framework around the strategic nuclear weapons that exist , " says volker .
" on balance that is probably a good thing to do rather than a bad thing to do . "
while the new pact is mostly regarded as an important follow-up to the expired start treaty , most experts consider it a modest step rather than an ambitious leap toward nuclear disarmament .
it will cut the number of deployed nuclear weapons by some 25 percent .
each side would be limited to 800 armed launchers .
the agreement also envisages slashing the number of nuclear warheads within the next seven years to 1,550 from currently 2,200 , which goes beyond a previous planned cut to 1,700 .
by most accounts the us may need to phase out more weapons than the russian side .
sico van der meer would have wanted a much more aggressive arms reduction pact , but he agrees with volker that this deal is better than no deal at all .
slow progress " europeans support the treaty not only because they are afraid of nuclear war , " he says .
" i do n't think that is really a possibility at the moment .
but the more weapons there are , the more risks there are for accidents or thefts of nuclear weapons by terrorists for example .
to reduce those risks is very important for europe , but also for the whole world . " # bwhile there are ultimately good reasons to pass the start treaty , volker remains deeply skeptical about the prospects for future arms reduction . " it generally cheers european hearts to see that arms control is moving ahead , " he says .
" i do n't think it is a harbinger of future success for arms control .
i do n't think the russians have any intentions of limiting their tactical nuclear weapons .
they have been very clear about that .
they have also pulled out of the cse treaty -lrb- conventional armed forces in europe - ed . -rrb- and i do n't see them going back into the cse .
so i do n't see this pointing the way ahead . "

are the demonstrations peaceful or is there a violent revolution taking place ?
the worldwide competition for opinions is about terms , their meaning and the constant presence in the media .
the number of national and international information providers keeps growing .
arabic , chinese or russian broadcasters have broken through the west ’ s former dominance and are providing another perspective to the world .
what some may call a fairly-won election , others call a fraud .
in the battle to win opinions and the struggle of interpretive predominance , deutsche welle presents the german perspective on worldwide events .
how is the worldwide financial crisis , the middle east conflict and the fight for a european constitution discussed in germany ?
how does the country work ?
its democracy , its rule of law , its social market economy ?
this is what deutsche welle delivers – smart , up-to-date and with all the necessary background information .
it stands behind independent journalism as that is the only way to ensure credibility .
from “ détente ” to intercultural dialogue when deutsche welle was first launched on may 3 , 1953 , the then german president theodor heuss said the task of germany ’ s international radio was to promote “ détente ” .
now , 60 years after the founding of the federal republic of germany and 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall and the east-west conflict , “ détente ” has given way to intercultural dialogue .
over the years , deutsche welle gained a reputation as “ the voice of freedom ” – from the 1968 “ prague spring ” and the era of dictatorship in greece to the wars in the balkans and in chechnya to the current trouble spots in afghanistan and iraq .
this is now being replaced by its growing standing as the “ voice of human rights ” . working with multimedia radio programming and online content is available in 30 languages : albanian , amharic , arabic , bengali , bulgarian , bosnian , chinese , croatian , dari , english , farsi , french , german , greek , hausa , hindi , indonesian , kiswahili , macedonian , pashtu , polish , portuguese -lrb- for africa and brazil -rrb- , romanian , russian , serbian , spanish , turkish , ukrainian and urdu .
in the course of digitalization and media convergence , deutsche welle began merging the radio and online departments in 2008 to create one multimedia team for each language .
the broadcasting center in bonn thus hosts many editorial teams that produce content for radio as well as for the multimedia website www.dw-world.de.
the internet is an interactive medium and plays an important role when it comes to intercultural dialogue .
communication is two-way and the user ’ s opinion is in demand – via e-mail , in forums or surveys .
there is also a wide variety of newsletters available free of charge .
deutsche welle is one of the leaders on the internet when it comes to audio and video content .
programming from dw-tv and dw-radio is available around the clock as a live stream or in the online archive .
even older programs are accessible .
deutsche welle was the first german broadcaster to utilize podcasting – downloadable audio and video content also available on a subscription basis .
now there are more than 50 programs in several different languages to download .
users can also access a large percentage of content in all 30 languages from their mobile devices by going to http : / / mobile.dw-world.de.
variety of websites and services the online presence includes much more , like study-in-germany.de – the gateway for students and scientists .
this portal offers all you need to know about education and research in germany – and that in eight languages : arabic , chinese , english , french , german , japanese , russian and spanish .
it includes information about 350 colleges and research institutions and 150 college towns .
deutsche welle also offers online courses to help users improve their german – like for those who are planning a trip to germany .
there are downloadable textbooks as well as interactive language courses and audio samples for online learning .
the full range of courses and learning materials can be found online at www.dw-world.de / germancourses .
promoting the german language is also part of deutsche welle ’ s mission .
the bobs : the best international weblogs from text and pictures to video and audio content , users around the world are producing their own content under the general term web 2.0 – often with a radical view of the world they live in .
especially in countries where freedom of the press is limited , like iran , china and cuba , blogs are one of the few ways for people to express themselves freely .
deutsche welle created the bobs blog award in 2004 , giving a unique overview of the international weblog scene in 11 languages : arabic , bengali , chinese , english , farsi , french , german , indonesian , portuguese , russian and spanish .
every year , an international jury chooses the best blogs in various categories .
with its “ blogopedia ” , www.thebobs.com provides a constantly growing encyclopedia for weblogs .
the best bloggers are awarded at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn -lrb- www.dw-gmf.de -rrb- .
