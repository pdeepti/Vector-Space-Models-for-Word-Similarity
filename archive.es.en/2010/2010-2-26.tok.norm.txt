this month has seen german no-frills supermarket lidl embroiled in a food poisoning scandal that killed six customers , infected several more and hoisted a question mark over the safety of discount food products . it took several weeks for investigators to trace the fatal bacterial infections , which occurred in austria and southern germany last year , to the same food source .
with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "
same system for one and all moreover , he said manufacturers , retailers and gastronomists in germany are all subject to the same safety and hygiene regulations , no matter how big , small , cheap or expensive the establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what 's in the box , the same safety and hygiene standards apply yet while there is no obvious way for discounters to cut corners , ruecker says german quality controls leave a lot to be desired .
not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .
in search of transparency that being the case , ruecker believes the only real solution is transparency .
if consumers were informed , say by a notice in the window or an online register , retailers who were not putting the interests of the public first would be exposed , and consumers would be free to make informed choices .
but dr edwin ernst , consumer safety expert with the baden-wuerttemberg ministry for food and agriculture , told deutsche welle it is not the only job of the authorities to regulate hygiene standards .
bildunterschrift : food saftey inspectors ca n't be everywhere at once " controls are only the tip of the iceberg , " he said .
" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

this month has seen german no-frills supermarket lidl embroiled in a food poisoning scandal that killed six customers , infected several more and hoisted a question mark over the safety of discount food products . it took several weeks for investigators to trace the fatal bacterial infections , which occurred in austria and southern germany last year , to the same food source .
with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "
same system for one and all moreover , he said manufacturers , retailers and gastronomists in germany are all subject to the same safety and hygiene regulations , no matter how big , small , cheap or expensive the establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what 's in the box , the same safety and hygiene standards apply yet while there is no obvious way for discounters to cut corners , ruecker says german quality controls leave a lot to be desired .
not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .
in search of transparency that being the case , ruecker believes the only real solution is transparency .
if consumers were informed , say by a notice in the window or an online register , retailers who were not putting the interests of the public first would be exposed , and consumers would be free to make informed choices .
but dr edwin ernst , consumer safety expert with the baden-wuerttemberg ministry for food and agriculture , told deutsche welle it is not the only job of the authorities to regulate hygiene standards .
bildunterschrift : food saftey inspectors ca n't be everywhere at once " controls are only the tip of the iceberg , " he said .
" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved the plan two weeks ago , in which an additional 850 troops would be sent to afghanistan , boosting the number of soldiers on the ground to around 5,350 .
a broad majority of merkel 's christian democrats , free democrats and social democrats supported the extension of the german mandate in afghanistan , with the additional troops , by one year .
a total of 429 parliamentarians voted in favor , with 111 voting against and 46 abstentions . of the fresh troops , 350 have been earmarked as a flexible reserves for special situations like securing parliamentary elections planned for later this year .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .

through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "
thumbs up from the democrat party kraisak choonhavan , a member of the governing democrat party , praised the judiciary for the verdict .
" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "
but others are less sure .
thaksin gained his popularity through populist policies for the rural and urban poor but was accused by the urban middle class of corruption and abuse of power .

thaksin has been an agent for that transformation .

red shirt groups have vowed to maintain pressure against the government with fresh demonstrations due to get underway in mid march in a bid to force the government of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to call new elections .

'
but is it really ?
this month has seen german no-frills supermarket lidl embroiled in a food poisoning scandal that killed six customers , infected several more and hoisted a question mark over the safety of discount food products . it took several weeks for investigators to trace the fatal bacterial infections , which occurred in austria and southern germany last year , to the same food source .
with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "
same system for one and all moreover , he said manufacturers , retailers and gastronomists in germany are all subject to the same safety and hygiene regulations , no matter how big , small , cheap or expensive the establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what 's in the box , the same safety and hygiene standards apply yet while there is no obvious way for discounters to cut corners , ruecker says german quality controls leave a lot to be desired .
not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .
in search of transparency that being the case , ruecker believes the only real solution is transparency .
if consumers were informed , say by a notice in the window or an online register , retailers who were not putting the interests of the public first would be exposed , and consumers would be free to make informed choices .
but dr edwin ernst , consumer safety expert with the baden-wuerttemberg ministry for food and agriculture , told deutsche welle it is not the only job of the authorities to regulate hygiene standards .
bildunterschrift : food saftey inspectors ca n't be everywhere at once " controls are only the tip of the iceberg , " he said .
" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 26.02.2010 helping hand for german companies threatened by insolvency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mergermarket forum attracted managers from all over germany if you take the right steps even insolvency does not mean the death of a company .
shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .
then we had " waiting for godot " by samuel beckett , which we renamed to " waiting for rain , " and the last project we did together was " women 's hammam . "
we worked on all plays with four groups and performed them in german , arabic , kurdish , and in persian or turkish . last year you used works by bertolt brecht and heiner mueller for the projects .

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .

" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .

switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 26.02.2010 helping hand for german companies threatened by insolvency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mergermarket forum attracted managers from all over germany if you take the right steps even insolvency does not mean the death of a company .
shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 26.02.2010 helping hand for german companies threatened by insolvency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mergermarket forum attracted managers from all over germany if you take the right steps even insolvency does not mean the death of a company .
shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

an extradition hearing is set for march 18 , he said .
turkish authorities believe adir , who lives in germany , is a leading member of the kurdistan workers ' party , or pkk .
the separatist party is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the european union , and the united states .
plan to protest the arrest took place on january 19 , adir 's lawyer bart nooitgedacht told germany 's dpa news agency .
now , ankara has requested his extradition to turkey .
the dutch justice ministry confirmed the arrest and the date of the extradition hearing .
nooitgedacht said his client would fight any move to extratdite him , due to fears that he would be tortured or killed in turkey .
he claims turkish officials tortured him in the past and that he fled to germany after several of his relatives were killed .
nooitgedacht also said germany had effectively acknowledged that his client 's fears were legitimate and thus had refused to extradite him .
" a german court has already established my client runs the risk of being tortured .
turkey considers him to be a state risk and as someone who can provide information about a terrorist organization , " nooitgedacht said. jen / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved the plan two weeks ago , in which an additional 850 troops would be sent to afghanistan , boosting the number of soldiers on the ground to around 5,350 .
a broad majority of merkel 's christian democrats , free democrats and social democrats supported the extension of the german mandate in afghanistan , with the additional troops , by one year .
a total of 429 parliamentarians voted in favor , with 111 voting against and 46 abstentions . of the fresh troops , 350 have been earmarked as a flexible reserves for special situations like securing parliamentary elections planned for later this year .

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .
a win would have moved dortmund into fourth place ahead of hamburg , but instead they stay in fifth , four points ahead of werder bremen. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "
same system for one and all moreover , he said manufacturers , retailers and gastronomists in germany are all subject to the same safety and hygiene regulations , no matter how big , small , cheap or expensive the establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what 's in the box , the same safety and hygiene standards apply yet while there is no obvious way for discounters to cut corners , ruecker says german quality controls leave a lot to be desired .
not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .
in search of transparency that being the case , ruecker believes the only real solution is transparency .
if consumers were informed , say by a notice in the window or an online register , retailers who were not putting the interests of the public first would be exposed , and consumers would be free to make informed choices .
but dr edwin ernst , consumer safety expert with the baden-wuerttemberg ministry for food and agriculture , told deutsche welle it is not the only job of the authorities to regulate hygiene standards .
bildunterschrift : food saftey inspectors ca n't be everywhere at once " controls are only the tip of the iceberg , " he said .
" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "
in an interview with south american broadcaster telesur , bolivian president evo morales lent his own weight to the vision of a south american brotherhood united against the us .
morales was among many who recently voiced concern about the huge us military presence now stationed on haiti and the summit pledged to send a further $ 25 million -lrb- 18.5 million euros -rrb- to the earthquake-hit country .
" a union of latin american countries is the weapon against imperialism .
it is necessary to create a regional body that excludes the united states and canada , " morales said .
" where there are us military bases that do not respect democracy , where there is political empire with his blackmailers , with its constraints , there is no development for that country , and especially there is no social peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president calderon of mexico , third right , announced the birth of the new organization but the summit also revealed the many tensions likely to threaten the prospective new bloc .
the project nearly ran aground this week on the continuing conflict between neighboring venezuala and colombia .
colombia is considered a close ally of the us , and venezuela often perceives itself under threat . jamaican head of state bruce golding admitted that such tensions were unlikely to go away overnight .
" in the past , there were too many occasions where we fought one another .
but we still had to live in the same part of the world .
i hope that we find ways in the new community to talk about what divides us with the aim of achieving unity . "
doubts over south american strength but doubts have also been voiced about the strength and belligerence of the proposed body when it actually comes into being .
few specifics have been revealed about its structure , much of which is yet to be decided , and rafael fernandez de castro , calderon 's top foreign policy advisor , told the miami herald newspaper that the new organization will have neither a building or a permanent staff , and would operate according to a " flexible " program of summits - in other words , celc would convene either every one or two years .
on top of this , the six nations that have been chosen to draw up the new body 's mission statement - mexico , brazil , chile , jamaica , the dominican republic and venezuela - are mainly countries with no interest in antagonizing the us .
the fact that us-friendly chile takes over the two-year presidency of the group of rio in march is unlikely to sharpen tensions within the americas either .

what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .

playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .

the move has been widely criticized . politiken is the first danish newspaper to offer an apology to muslims who were offended by what they deem disrespectful drawings of the prophet muhammad .
" we apologize to anyone who was offended by our decision to reprint the cartoon drawing , " the newspaper said in a statement on friday .
the paper has published an agreement with eight organizations from australia , egypt , jordan , lebanon , libya , qatar , saudi arabia and the palestinian territories , representing 94,923 descendants of the muslim prophet .
no regrets despite the apology , politiken says it does not regret printing the cartoons , but that it was sorry it had offended some muslims .
" we deplore that muslims were offended , even if that was not our intention , " editor-in-chief toeger seidenfaden said .
in august last year , 11 danish newspapers were approached by faisal yamani , the lawyer who represents the descendants , with demands that the cartoons be removed from the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish daily jyllands-posten first published the cartoons in 2005 yamani also wanted an apology and a promise that the cartoons would not be printed again .
but politiken has reserved the right to reprint the cartoons .
move draws criticism politiken 's move has been widely criticized in denmark .
" it 's a sad day for danish media , it 's sad for freedom of expression , and it 's sad for politiken , " the chief editor of jyllands-posten , joern mikkelsen , wrote .
his paper had first published the cartoons in 2005 .
politicians also condemned the move .
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen told danish tv that the apology could be seen as " a break with the cohesion that existed in the media and in danish society . "
worldwide protests the most controversial of the 12 drawings was created by danish cartoonist knut westergaard , and showed the prophet wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse .
the cartoons ' publication sparked a wave of protests among muslims in syria , beirut , nigeria , sudan and other countries with large muslim populations .
politiken and 19 other danish media decided to reprint the cartoons in 2008 , after an attack on westergaard by angered muslims. ng / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .
they are big boys and must succeed on their own . - malcolm clayton , canada greeks should learn to live within their means , tackle corruption and learn to work efficiently by achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense . - daniel maravei , canada the phrase from your article " violent protests and strikes : greeks oppose government plans " " … most schools and universities were closed … " is only partially true .
i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .

furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .
a win would have moved dortmund into fourth place ahead of hamburg , but instead they stay in fifth , four points ahead of werder bremen. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "
thumbs up from the democrat party kraisak choonhavan , a member of the governing democrat party , praised the judiciary for the verdict .
" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "
but others are less sure .
thaksin gained his popularity through populist policies for the rural and urban poor but was accused by the urban middle class of corruption and abuse of power .

thaksin has been an agent for that transformation .

red shirt groups have vowed to maintain pressure against the government with fresh demonstrations due to get underway in mid march in a bid to force the government of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to call new elections .

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "
thumbs up from the democrat party kraisak choonhavan , a member of the governing democrat party , praised the judiciary for the verdict .
" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "
but others are less sure .
thaksin gained his popularity through populist policies for the rural and urban poor but was accused by the urban middle class of corruption and abuse of power .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .

tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .

afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .

the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .

shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .

the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

an extradition hearing is set for march 18 , he said .
turkish authorities believe adir , who lives in germany , is a leading member of the kurdistan workers ' party , or pkk .
the separatist party is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the european union , and the united states .
plan to protest the arrest took place on january 19 , adir 's lawyer bart nooitgedacht told germany 's dpa news agency .
now , ankara has requested his extradition to turkey .
the dutch justice ministry confirmed the arrest and the date of the extradition hearing .
nooitgedacht said his client would fight any move to extratdite him , due to fears that he would be tortured or killed in turkey .
he claims turkish officials tortured him in the past and that he fled to germany after several of his relatives were killed .
nooitgedacht also said germany had effectively acknowledged that his client 's fears were legitimate and thus had refused to extradite him .
" a german court has already established my client runs the risk of being tortured .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 26.02.2010 south america to create new eu-type bloc to defy us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez led the push for a new bloc the 24-strong bloc of latin american states known as the rio group is to join the caribbean community to form a new trade body intended to present opposition to us dominance .
what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .

what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "
in an interview with south american broadcaster telesur , bolivian president evo morales lent his own weight to the vision of a south american brotherhood united against the us .

however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .

" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .

chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved the plan two weeks ago , in which an additional 850 troops would be sent to afghanistan , boosting the number of soldiers on the ground to around 5,350 .
a broad majority of merkel 's christian democrats , free democrats and social democrats supported the extension of the german mandate in afghanistan , with the additional troops , by one year .
a total of 429 parliamentarians voted in favor , with 111 voting against and 46 abstentions . of the fresh troops , 350 have been earmarked as a flexible reserves for special situations like securing parliamentary elections planned for later this year .

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .
then we had " waiting for godot " by samuel beckett , which we renamed to " waiting for rain , " and the last project we did together was " women 's hammam . "
we worked on all plays with four groups and performed them in german , arabic , kurdish , and in persian or turkish . last year you used works by bertolt brecht and heiner mueller for the projects .
do these texts match the situation in iraq and are they understood there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertolt brecht 's plays are well known in iraq of course , because i think these themes are global topics .
brecht did n't write about a local topic , even though you can turn a local topic into a world topic .
when you look at what heiner mueller or brecht wrote , most of the themes stem from neighboring or far-away countries .
we have , for example , taken scenes from " the caucasian chalk circle " or from " mother courage , " and those are all foreign topics from places like russia , asia or greece .
and brecht , especially brecht , is in iraq - and i think in the east in general - a special figure in theatrical history , and almost every theater in iraq knows him and heiner mueller . for a long time , brecht was forbidden in iraq and that 's why his and mueller 's plays are especially suited to countries that have experienced a violent war and are being rebuilt .
heiner mueller and brecht will never go out of fashion around the world and especially not in countries affected by crisis . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 26.02.2010 south america to create new eu-type bloc to defy us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez led the push for a new bloc the 24-strong bloc of latin american states known as the rio group is to join the caribbean community to form a new trade body intended to present opposition to us dominance .
what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "
in an interview with south american broadcaster telesur , bolivian president evo morales lent his own weight to the vision of a south american brotherhood united against the us .
morales was among many who recently voiced concern about the huge us military presence now stationed on haiti and the summit pledged to send a further $ 25 million -lrb- 18.5 million euros -rrb- to the earthquake-hit country .
" a union of latin american countries is the weapon against imperialism .
it is necessary to create a regional body that excludes the united states and canada , " morales said .
" where there are us military bases that do not respect democracy , where there is political empire with his blackmailers , with its constraints , there is no development for that country , and especially there is no social peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president calderon of mexico , third right , announced the birth of the new organization but the summit also revealed the many tensions likely to threaten the prospective new bloc .
the project nearly ran aground this week on the continuing conflict between neighboring venezuala and colombia .
colombia is considered a close ally of the us , and venezuela often perceives itself under threat . jamaican head of state bruce golding admitted that such tensions were unlikely to go away overnight .
" in the past , there were too many occasions where we fought one another .
but we still had to live in the same part of the world .
i hope that we find ways in the new community to talk about what divides us with the aim of achieving unity . "
doubts over south american strength but doubts have also been voiced about the strength and belligerence of the proposed body when it actually comes into being .
few specifics have been revealed about its structure , much of which is yet to be decided , and rafael fernandez de castro , calderon 's top foreign policy advisor , told the miami herald newspaper that the new organization will have neither a building or a permanent staff , and would operate according to a " flexible " program of summits - in other words , celc would convene either every one or two years .
on top of this , the six nations that have been chosen to draw up the new body 's mission statement - mexico , brazil , chile , jamaica , the dominican republic and venezuela - are mainly countries with no interest in antagonizing the us .
the fact that us-friendly chile takes over the two-year presidency of the group of rio in march is unlikely to sharpen tensions within the americas either .

an extradition hearing is set for march 18 , he said .
turkish authorities believe adir , who lives in germany , is a leading member of the kurdistan workers ' party , or pkk .
the separatist party is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the european union , and the united states .
plan to protest the arrest took place on january 19 , adir 's lawyer bart nooitgedacht told germany 's dpa news agency .
now , ankara has requested his extradition to turkey .
the dutch justice ministry confirmed the arrest and the date of the extradition hearing .
nooitgedacht said his client would fight any move to extratdite him , due to fears that he would be tortured or killed in turkey .
he claims turkish officials tortured him in the past and that he fled to germany after several of his relatives were killed .
nooitgedacht also said germany had effectively acknowledged that his client 's fears were legitimate and thus had refused to extradite him .
" a german court has already established my client runs the risk of being tortured .
turkey considers him to be a state risk and as someone who can provide information about a terrorist organization , " nooitgedacht said. jen / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .

yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .

further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .

this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .

it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?

i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .

i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .

" we do not think that negotiations have stranded and there 's still a possibility to reach a reasonable solution between the three nations , " she told reporters in reykjavik . " we still have something up our sleeves , " she told the reuters news agency after the conference .
late thursday , the latest round of talks fell apart between iceland , britain and the netherlands , over the repayment of $ 5.7 billion -lrb- 4.2 billion euros -rrb- lost by icelandic internet bank icesave .
referendum still on the cards iceland had planned a referendum on march 6 to decide whether to approve the terms of an icesave deal negotiated with the british and dutch governments last summer .
siguardottir said there was still a chance , albeit a slim one , to avoid the referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grimsson has turned the issue over to the people officials from all three countries have been meeting in london for the past two weeks to try and thrash out a consensus on how to return funds spent by britain and the netherlands to compensate their citizens ' depositors the icelandic internet bank , which collapsed with its parent landsbanki in october 2008 .
some 320,000 british and dutch savers were victims of the icesave collapse .
iceland 's president olafur ragnar grimsson has refused to sign legislation approved by parliament that would pay the two governments 3.8 billion euros for their reimbursements .
reykjavik rejected deal grimsson instead referred the issue to a referendum , citing public opposition , and opinion polls predicting the legislation would be rejected .
officials with knowledge of the talks said the main revision under discussion was a floating interest rate , replacing the 5.6 percent under the previous deal , ap news service reported .
such a rate could make it cheaper for iceland to repay its loans .
looking for next move a spokesman for the british treasury said his and the dutch governments were " disappointed " by the result .
" we have consistently supported iceland 's economic recovery and our latest proposal built upon this , " he said .
according to a source familiar with the situation , there are no new talks scheduled between iceland and the netherlands , so whether a deal can be reached is still unclear .
the latest developments could further threaten the likelihood of iceland joining the european union , as the uk and the netherlands have hinted that they will block accession talks with the north atlantic nation if the icesave issue is not resolved. ng / jen / reuters / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .

shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .

the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "

" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "

it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "

in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .
a win would have moved dortmund into fourth place ahead of hamburg , but instead they stay in fifth , four points ahead of werder bremen. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .
a win would have moved dortmund into fourth place ahead of hamburg , but instead they stay in fifth , four points ahead of werder bremen. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .
a win would have moved dortmund into fourth place ahead of hamburg , but instead they stay in fifth , four points ahead of werder bremen. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

this month has seen german no-frills supermarket lidl embroiled in a food poisoning scandal that killed six customers , infected several more and hoisted a question mark over the safety of discount food products . it took several weeks for investigators to trace the fatal bacterial infections , which occurred in austria and southern germany last year , to the same food source .
with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "
same system for one and all moreover , he said manufacturers , retailers and gastronomists in germany are all subject to the same safety and hygiene regulations , no matter how big , small , cheap or expensive the establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what 's in the box , the same safety and hygiene standards apply yet while there is no obvious way for discounters to cut corners , ruecker says german quality controls leave a lot to be desired .
not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .
in search of transparency that being the case , ruecker believes the only real solution is transparency .
if consumers were informed , say by a notice in the window or an online register , retailers who were not putting the interests of the public first would be exposed , and consumers would be free to make informed choices .
but dr edwin ernst , consumer safety expert with the baden-wuerttemberg ministry for food and agriculture , told deutsche welle it is not the only job of the authorities to regulate hygiene standards .
bildunterschrift : food saftey inspectors ca n't be everywhere at once " controls are only the tip of the iceberg , " he said .
" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

this month has seen german no-frills supermarket lidl embroiled in a food poisoning scandal that killed six customers , infected several more and hoisted a question mark over the safety of discount food products . it took several weeks for investigators to trace the fatal bacterial infections , which occurred in austria and southern germany last year , to the same food source .
with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "

not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .

collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .

" we do not think that negotiations have stranded and there 's still a possibility to reach a reasonable solution between the three nations , " she told reporters in reykjavik . " we still have something up our sleeves , " she told the reuters news agency after the conference .
late thursday , the latest round of talks fell apart between iceland , britain and the netherlands , over the repayment of $ 5.7 billion -lrb- 4.2 billion euros -rrb- lost by icelandic internet bank icesave .
referendum still on the cards iceland had planned a referendum on march 6 to decide whether to approve the terms of an icesave deal negotiated with the british and dutch governments last summer .
siguardottir said there was still a chance , albeit a slim one , to avoid the referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grimsson has turned the issue over to the people officials from all three countries have been meeting in london for the past two weeks to try and thrash out a consensus on how to return funds spent by britain and the netherlands to compensate their citizens ' depositors the icelandic internet bank , which collapsed with its parent landsbanki in october 2008 .
some 320,000 british and dutch savers were victims of the icesave collapse .
iceland 's president olafur ragnar grimsson has refused to sign legislation approved by parliament that would pay the two governments 3.8 billion euros for their reimbursements .
reykjavik rejected deal grimsson instead referred the issue to a referendum , citing public opposition , and opinion polls predicting the legislation would be rejected .
officials with knowledge of the talks said the main revision under discussion was a floating interest rate , replacing the 5.6 percent under the previous deal , ap news service reported .
such a rate could make it cheaper for iceland to repay its loans .
looking for next move a spokesman for the british treasury said his and the dutch governments were " disappointed " by the result .
" we have consistently supported iceland 's economic recovery and our latest proposal built upon this , " he said .
according to a source familiar with the situation , there are no new talks scheduled between iceland and the netherlands , so whether a deal can be reached is still unclear .
the latest developments could further threaten the likelihood of iceland joining the european union , as the uk and the netherlands have hinted that they will block accession talks with the north atlantic nation if the icesave issue is not resolved. ng / jen / reuters / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grimsson has turned the issue over to the people officials from all three countries have been meeting in london for the past two weeks to try and thrash out a consensus on how to return funds spent by britain and the netherlands to compensate their citizens ' depositors the icelandic internet bank , which collapsed with its parent landsbanki in october 2008 .
some 320,000 british and dutch savers were victims of the icesave collapse .
iceland 's president olafur ragnar grimsson has refused to sign legislation approved by parliament that would pay the two governments 3.8 billion euros for their reimbursements .
reykjavik rejected deal grimsson instead referred the issue to a referendum , citing public opposition , and opinion polls predicting the legislation would be rejected .
officials with knowledge of the talks said the main revision under discussion was a floating interest rate , replacing the 5.6 percent under the previous deal , ap news service reported .
such a rate could make it cheaper for iceland to repay its loans .
looking for next move a spokesman for the british treasury said his and the dutch governments were " disappointed " by the result .
" we have consistently supported iceland 's economic recovery and our latest proposal built upon this , " he said .
according to a source familiar with the situation , there are no new talks scheduled between iceland and the netherlands , so whether a deal can be reached is still unclear .
the latest developments could further threaten the likelihood of iceland joining the european union , as the uk and the netherlands have hinted that they will block accession talks with the north atlantic nation if the icesave issue is not resolved. ng / jen / reuters / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one woman 's politics cloud citizenship chances großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : menger-hamilton says she feels european - and that means german , too how far left is too left , when it comes to becoming a german ?
a woman raised in the country has applied for citizenship , but due to her politics , the outlook is dim . it was a process that should have taken three to six months , but it 's been going on for nearly three years : a 31-year-old woman with scottish and italian parents has applied for german citizenship , and she is still waiting for a reply .
her prospects are uncertain - and it 's all because she was active in far-left politics .
jannine menger-hamilton was born to european parents and raised in germany , so she applied for citizenship in 2007 .
" i feel that i am quite european , with an italian mother and scottish father and living in germany , and i do n't know why i should n't have german citizenship , since i would live here , and i would like to vote here , " menger-hamilton said .
surprise in the file bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is getting more popular among youth unfortunately , her application was made five years after a regulation went into effect that was created in the wake of the september 11 terror attacks in the united states .
that rule requires that germany 's office for protection of the constitution examine the suitability of citizenship applicants .
when no decision was forthcoming , menger-hamilton asked to see her file - and was surprised by what she found .
the office had written that she was unsuitable to receive a german passport because she has been active in the left party - a party formed out of a combination of the old communist party in east germany and disaffected lefties from the west .
the problem is that germany " thinks i am not a real democrat , " menger-hamilton said .
a legal party " the only reason for them to say that is that i 'm a member of the party die linke , which is a socialist party in germany , " she explained .
what makes the decision hard to understand is that the left party is n't illegal in germany .
in fact , it is the fourth-largest political party in the country , with representation in a number of state parliaments and 76 legislators in the bundestag .
it is also strongly represented in the european parliament .
now many in germany are asking how membership in a legally recognized political party could possibly be counted as a strike against someone applying for german citizenship .
left party politicians in lower saxony have called the ruling arbitrary , and some have intimated that the decision is a political one , led by right-wing forces in the state 's conservative cdu-run interior ministry .
political motivation is questioned kreszentia flauger , the head of the left party parliamentary group in lower saxony , called the action " arbitrary , " according to broadcaster ndr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german citizenship applications are usually processed within months " interior minister -lsb- uwe -rsb- schuenemann is trying to carry out his discriminatory campaign against the left party by means of controlling citizenship rights , " she said .
and berlin political researcher hans-gerd jaschke said ' extremism ' " is n't a legal term . whether or not to call the left party extremist is a political assessment of the interior ministry . "
for its part , lower saxony 's interior ministry denies any political motivation for the decision , and a ministry spokesman pointed out that the party is under permanent surveillance in certain regions by the country 's intelligence agencies , which keep an eye out for terrorist and anarchist activity .
" the left party is a party on the extreme left wing of the party system , and it is watched over by the office for protection of the constitution in many german states , " ministry spokesman klaus engemann said .
perplexed and hurt the state is keeping the left party under watch because " there are serious doubts that the left party conforms to the german constitution - doubts that , on the contrary , it does n't want to override the state , " engemann said .
and it is why menger-hamilton 's political activity - she was the deputy treasurer for a party office in hanover - casts doubt on her willingness to adhere to german constitutional law , he added .
meanwhile , menger-hamilton said she is " perplexed " and " hurt " by the authorities ' reaction .
" i do n't know how they explain it ...
they do n't have any special reason against my person .
here is nothing that i have ever said or done which would indicate that i 'm not a democrat . "
now , she just has to wait for the final decision to come on whether or not the country where she was raised and went to school , where she studied german literature at university , and where she took her marriage vows , will someday let her cast a ballot .

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

i 'll not buy german products again .

when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .

does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .

the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .

chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved the plan two weeks ago , in which an additional 850 troops would be sent to afghanistan , boosting the number of soldiers on the ground to around 5,350 .
a broad majority of merkel 's christian democrats , free democrats and social democrats supported the extension of the german mandate in afghanistan , with the additional troops , by one year .

i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "

germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .

does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .

i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .
they are big boys and must succeed on their own . - malcolm clayton , canada greeks should learn to live within their means , tackle corruption and learn to work efficiently by achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense . - daniel maravei , canada the phrase from your article " violent protests and strikes : greeks oppose government plans " " … most schools and universities were closed … " is only partially true .
i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "
thumbs up from the democrat party kraisak choonhavan , a member of the governing democrat party , praised the judiciary for the verdict .
" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "
but others are less sure .
thaksin gained his popularity through populist policies for the rural and urban poor but was accused by the urban middle class of corruption and abuse of power .

thaksin has been supported by groups who wear red shirts as identification .
" the verdict is only going to start a new cycle , another episode , turning the leaf for thailand 's political transformation .
thaksin has been an agent for that transformation .
he keeps coming back , along with his followers .
the red shirts keep coming back . "
red shirt groups have vowed to maintain pressure against the government with fresh demonstrations due to get underway in mid march in a bid to force the government of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to call new elections .

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "
thumbs up from the democrat party kraisak choonhavan , a member of the governing democrat party , praised the judiciary for the verdict .
" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "
but others are less sure .
thaksin gained his popularity through populist policies for the rural and urban poor but was accused by the urban middle class of corruption and abuse of power .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .

afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .

tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .

afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved the plan two weeks ago , in which an additional 850 troops would be sent to afghanistan , boosting the number of soldiers on the ground to around 5,350 .
a broad majority of merkel 's christian democrats , free democrats and social democrats supported the extension of the german mandate in afghanistan , with the additional troops , by one year .
a total of 429 parliamentarians voted in favor , with 111 voting against and 46 abstentions . of the fresh troops , 350 have been earmarked as a flexible reserves for special situations like securing parliamentary elections planned for later this year .

the new mandate runs until february 28 , 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 26.02.2010 helping hand for german companies threatened by insolvency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mergermarket forum attracted managers from all over germany if you take the right steps even insolvency does not mean the death of a company .
shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 26.02.2010 helping hand for german companies threatened by insolvency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mergermarket forum attracted managers from all over germany if you take the right steps even insolvency does not mean the death of a company .
shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 26.02.2010 helping hand for german companies threatened by insolvency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mergermarket forum attracted managers from all over germany if you take the right steps even insolvency does not mean the death of a company .
shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 26.02.2010 south america to create new eu-type bloc to defy us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez led the push for a new bloc the 24-strong bloc of latin american states known as the rio group is to join the caribbean community to form a new trade body intended to present opposition to us dominance .
what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "
in an interview with south american broadcaster telesur , bolivian president evo morales lent his own weight to the vision of a south american brotherhood united against the us .
morales was among many who recently voiced concern about the huge us military presence now stationed on haiti and the summit pledged to send a further $ 25 million -lrb- 18.5 million euros -rrb- to the earthquake-hit country .
" a union of latin american countries is the weapon against imperialism .
it is necessary to create a regional body that excludes the united states and canada , " morales said .
" where there are us military bases that do not respect democracy , where there is political empire with his blackmailers , with its constraints , there is no development for that country , and especially there is no social peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president calderon of mexico , third right , announced the birth of the new organization but the summit also revealed the many tensions likely to threaten the prospective new bloc .
the project nearly ran aground this week on the continuing conflict between neighboring venezuala and colombia .
colombia is considered a close ally of the us , and venezuela often perceives itself under threat . jamaican head of state bruce golding admitted that such tensions were unlikely to go away overnight .
" in the past , there were too many occasions where we fought one another .
but we still had to live in the same part of the world .
i hope that we find ways in the new community to talk about what divides us with the aim of achieving unity . "
doubts over south american strength but doubts have also been voiced about the strength and belligerence of the proposed body when it actually comes into being .
few specifics have been revealed about its structure , much of which is yet to be decided , and rafael fernandez de castro , calderon 's top foreign policy advisor , told the miami herald newspaper that the new organization will have neither a building or a permanent staff , and would operate according to a " flexible " program of summits - in other words , celc would convene either every one or two years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 26.02.2010 south america to create new eu-type bloc to defy us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez led the push for a new bloc the 24-strong bloc of latin american states known as the rio group is to join the caribbean community to form a new trade body intended to present opposition to us dominance .
what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "
in an interview with south american broadcaster telesur , bolivian president evo morales lent his own weight to the vision of a south american brotherhood united against the us .
morales was among many who recently voiced concern about the huge us military presence now stationed on haiti and the summit pledged to send a further $ 25 million -lrb- 18.5 million euros -rrb- to the earthquake-hit country .
" a union of latin american countries is the weapon against imperialism .
it is necessary to create a regional body that excludes the united states and canada , " morales said .
" where there are us military bases that do not respect democracy , where there is political empire with his blackmailers , with its constraints , there is no development for that country , and especially there is no social peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president calderon of mexico , third right , announced the birth of the new organization but the summit also revealed the many tensions likely to threaten the prospective new bloc .
the project nearly ran aground this week on the continuing conflict between neighboring venezuala and colombia .
colombia is considered a close ally of the us , and venezuela often perceives itself under threat . jamaican head of state bruce golding admitted that such tensions were unlikely to go away overnight .
" in the past , there were too many occasions where we fought one another .
but we still had to live in the same part of the world .
i hope that we find ways in the new community to talk about what divides us with the aim of achieving unity . "
doubts over south american strength but doubts have also been voiced about the strength and belligerence of the proposed body when it actually comes into being .
few specifics have been revealed about its structure , much of which is yet to be decided , and rafael fernandez de castro , calderon 's top foreign policy advisor , told the miami herald newspaper that the new organization will have neither a building or a permanent staff , and would operate according to a " flexible " program of summits - in other words , celc would convene either every one or two years .
on top of this , the six nations that have been chosen to draw up the new body 's mission statement - mexico , brazil , chile , jamaica , the dominican republic and venezuela - are mainly countries with no interest in antagonizing the us .
the fact that us-friendly chile takes over the two-year presidency of the group of rio in march is unlikely to sharpen tensions within the americas either .

chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet had approved the plan two weeks ago , in which an additional 850 troops would be sent to afghanistan , boosting the number of soldiers on the ground to around 5,350 .
a broad majority of merkel 's christian democrats , free democrats and social democrats supported the extension of the german mandate in afghanistan , with the additional troops , by one year .
a total of 429 parliamentarians voted in favor , with 111 voting against and 46 abstentions . of the fresh troops , 350 have been earmarked as a flexible reserves for special situations like securing parliamentary elections planned for later this year .

the new mandate runs until february 28 , 2011 .

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .
then we had " waiting for godot " by samuel beckett , which we renamed to " waiting for rain , " and the last project we did together was " women 's hammam . "
we worked on all plays with four groups and performed them in german , arabic , kurdish , and in persian or turkish . last year you used works by bertolt brecht and heiner mueller for the projects .
do these texts match the situation in iraq and are they understood there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertolt brecht 's plays are well known in iraq of course , because i think these themes are global topics .
brecht did n't write about a local topic , even though you can turn a local topic into a world topic .
when you look at what heiner mueller or brecht wrote , most of the themes stem from neighboring or far-away countries .
we have , for example , taken scenes from " the caucasian chalk circle " or from " mother courage , " and those are all foreign topics from places like russia , asia or greece .
and brecht , especially brecht , is in iraq - and i think in the east in general - a special figure in theatrical history , and almost every theater in iraq knows him and heiner mueller . for a long time , brecht was forbidden in iraq and that 's why his and mueller 's plays are especially suited to countries that have experienced a violent war and are being rebuilt .

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .

libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .

switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .
then we had " waiting for godot " by samuel beckett , which we renamed to " waiting for rain , " and the last project we did together was " women 's hammam . "
we worked on all plays with four groups and performed them in german , arabic , kurdish , and in persian or turkish . last year you used works by bertolt brecht and heiner mueller for the projects .
do these texts match the situation in iraq and are they understood there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertolt brecht 's plays are well known in iraq of course , because i think these themes are global topics .
brecht did n't write about a local topic , even though you can turn a local topic into a world topic .
when you look at what heiner mueller or brecht wrote , most of the themes stem from neighboring or far-away countries .
we have , for example , taken scenes from " the caucasian chalk circle " or from " mother courage , " and those are all foreign topics from places like russia , asia or greece .
and brecht , especially brecht , is in iraq - and i think in the east in general - a special figure in theatrical history , and almost every theater in iraq knows him and heiner mueller . for a long time , brecht was forbidden in iraq and that 's why his and mueller 's plays are especially suited to countries that have experienced a violent war and are being rebuilt .
heiner mueller and brecht will never go out of fashion around the world and especially not in countries affected by crisis . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .
then we had " waiting for godot " by samuel beckett , which we renamed to " waiting for rain , " and the last project we did together was " women 's hammam . "
we worked on all plays with four groups and performed them in german , arabic , kurdish , and in persian or turkish . last year you used works by bertolt brecht and heiner mueller for the projects .
do these texts match the situation in iraq and are they understood there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertolt brecht 's plays are well known in iraq of course , because i think these themes are global topics .
brecht did n't write about a local topic , even though you can turn a local topic into a world topic .
when you look at what heiner mueller or brecht wrote , most of the themes stem from neighboring or far-away countries .
we have , for example , taken scenes from " the caucasian chalk circle " or from " mother courage , " and those are all foreign topics from places like russia , asia or greece .
and brecht , especially brecht , is in iraq - and i think in the east in general - a special figure in theatrical history , and almost every theater in iraq knows him and heiner mueller . for a long time , brecht was forbidden in iraq and that 's why his and mueller 's plays are especially suited to countries that have experienced a violent war and are being rebuilt .

but is it really ?
this month has seen german no-frills supermarket lidl embroiled in a food poisoning scandal that killed six customers , infected several more and hoisted a question mark over the safety of discount food products . it took several weeks for investigators to trace the fatal bacterial infections , which occurred in austria and southern germany last year , to the same food source .
with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "
same system for one and all moreover , he said manufacturers , retailers and gastronomists in germany are all subject to the same safety and hygiene regulations , no matter how big , small , cheap or expensive the establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what 's in the box , the same safety and hygiene standards apply yet while there is no obvious way for discounters to cut corners , ruecker says german quality controls leave a lot to be desired .
not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .
in search of transparency that being the case , ruecker believes the only real solution is transparency .
if consumers were informed , say by a notice in the window or an online register , retailers who were not putting the interests of the public first would be exposed , and consumers would be free to make informed choices .
but dr edwin ernst , consumer safety expert with the baden-wuerttemberg ministry for food and agriculture , told deutsche welle it is not the only job of the authorities to regulate hygiene standards .
bildunterschrift : food saftey inspectors ca n't be everywhere at once " controls are only the tip of the iceberg , " he said .
" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

but is it really ?
this month has seen german no-frills supermarket lidl embroiled in a food poisoning scandal that killed six customers , infected several more and hoisted a question mark over the safety of discount food products . it took several weeks for investigators to trace the fatal bacterial infections , which occurred in austria and southern germany last year , to the same food source .
with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "
same system for one and all moreover , he said manufacturers , retailers and gastronomists in germany are all subject to the same safety and hygiene regulations , no matter how big , small , cheap or expensive the establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what 's in the box , the same safety and hygiene standards apply yet while there is no obvious way for discounters to cut corners , ruecker says german quality controls leave a lot to be desired .
not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .
in search of transparency that being the case , ruecker believes the only real solution is transparency .
if consumers were informed , say by a notice in the window or an online register , retailers who were not putting the interests of the public first would be exposed , and consumers would be free to make informed choices .
but dr edwin ernst , consumer safety expert with the baden-wuerttemberg ministry for food and agriculture , told deutsche welle it is not the only job of the authorities to regulate hygiene standards .
bildunterschrift : food saftey inspectors ca n't be everywhere at once " controls are only the tip of the iceberg , " he said .
" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "

libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one woman 's politics cloud citizenship chances großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : menger-hamilton says she feels european - and that means german , too how far left is too left , when it comes to becoming a german ?
a woman raised in the country has applied for citizenship , but due to her politics , the outlook is dim . it was a process that should have taken three to six months , but it 's been going on for nearly three years : a 31-year-old woman with scottish and italian parents has applied for german citizenship , and she is still waiting for a reply .
her prospects are uncertain - and it 's all because she was active in far-left politics .
jannine menger-hamilton was born to european parents and raised in germany , so she applied for citizenship in 2007 .
" i feel that i am quite european , with an italian mother and scottish father and living in germany , and i do n't know why i should n't have german citizenship , since i would live here , and i would like to vote here , " menger-hamilton said .
surprise in the file bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is getting more popular among youth unfortunately , her application was made five years after a regulation went into effect that was created in the wake of the september 11 terror attacks in the united states .
that rule requires that germany 's office for protection of the constitution examine the suitability of citizenship applicants .
when no decision was forthcoming , menger-hamilton asked to see her file - and was surprised by what she found .
the office had written that she was unsuitable to receive a german passport because she has been active in the left party - a party formed out of a combination of the old communist party in east germany and disaffected lefties from the west .
the problem is that germany " thinks i am not a real democrat , " menger-hamilton said .
a legal party " the only reason for them to say that is that i 'm a member of the party die linke , which is a socialist party in germany , " she explained .
what makes the decision hard to understand is that the left party is n't illegal in germany .
in fact , it is the fourth-largest political party in the country , with representation in a number of state parliaments and 76 legislators in the bundestag .
it is also strongly represented in the european parliament .
now many in germany are asking how membership in a legally recognized political party could possibly be counted as a strike against someone applying for german citizenship .
left party politicians in lower saxony have called the ruling arbitrary , and some have intimated that the decision is a political one , led by right-wing forces in the state 's conservative cdu-run interior ministry .
political motivation is questioned kreszentia flauger , the head of the left party parliamentary group in lower saxony , called the action " arbitrary , " according to broadcaster ndr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german citizenship applications are usually processed within months " interior minister -lsb- uwe -rsb- schuenemann is trying to carry out his discriminatory campaign against the left party by means of controlling citizenship rights , " she said .
and berlin political researcher hans-gerd jaschke said ' extremism ' " is n't a legal term . whether or not to call the left party extremist is a political assessment of the interior ministry . "
for its part , lower saxony 's interior ministry denies any political motivation for the decision , and a ministry spokesman pointed out that the party is under permanent surveillance in certain regions by the country 's intelligence agencies , which keep an eye out for terrorist and anarchist activity .
" the left party is a party on the extreme left wing of the party system , and it is watched over by the office for protection of the constitution in many german states , " ministry spokesman klaus engemann said .
perplexed and hurt the state is keeping the left party under watch because " there are serious doubts that the left party conforms to the german constitution - doubts that , on the contrary , it does n't want to override the state , " engemann said .
and it is why menger-hamilton 's political activity - she was the deputy treasurer for a party office in hanover - casts doubt on her willingness to adhere to german constitutional law , he added .
meanwhile , menger-hamilton said she is " perplexed " and " hurt " by the authorities ' reaction .
" i do n't know how they explain it ...
they do n't have any special reason against my person .
here is nothing that i have ever said or done which would indicate that i 'm not a democrat . "
now , she just has to wait for the final decision to come on whether or not the country where she was raised and went to school , where she studied german literature at university , and where she took her marriage vows , will someday let her cast a ballot .

one woman 's politics cloud citizenship chances großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : menger-hamilton says she feels european - and that means german , too how far left is too left , when it comes to becoming a german ?
a woman raised in the country has applied for citizenship , but due to her politics , the outlook is dim . it was a process that should have taken three to six months , but it 's been going on for nearly three years : a 31-year-old woman with scottish and italian parents has applied for german citizenship , and she is still waiting for a reply .
her prospects are uncertain - and it 's all because she was active in far-left politics .
jannine menger-hamilton was born to european parents and raised in germany , so she applied for citizenship in 2007 .
" i feel that i am quite european , with an italian mother and scottish father and living in germany , and i do n't know why i should n't have german citizenship , since i would live here , and i would like to vote here , " menger-hamilton said .
surprise in the file bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is getting more popular among youth unfortunately , her application was made five years after a regulation went into effect that was created in the wake of the september 11 terror attacks in the united states .
that rule requires that germany 's office for protection of the constitution examine the suitability of citizenship applicants .
when no decision was forthcoming , menger-hamilton asked to see her file - and was surprised by what she found .
the office had written that she was unsuitable to receive a german passport because she has been active in the left party - a party formed out of a combination of the old communist party in east germany and disaffected lefties from the west .
the problem is that germany " thinks i am not a real democrat , " menger-hamilton said .
a legal party " the only reason for them to say that is that i 'm a member of the party die linke , which is a socialist party in germany , " she explained .
what makes the decision hard to understand is that the left party is n't illegal in germany .
in fact , it is the fourth-largest political party in the country , with representation in a number of state parliaments and 76 legislators in the bundestag .
it is also strongly represented in the european parliament .
now many in germany are asking how membership in a legally recognized political party could possibly be counted as a strike against someone applying for german citizenship .
left party politicians in lower saxony have called the ruling arbitrary , and some have intimated that the decision is a political one , led by right-wing forces in the state 's conservative cdu-run interior ministry .
political motivation is questioned kreszentia flauger , the head of the left party parliamentary group in lower saxony , called the action " arbitrary , " according to broadcaster ndr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german citizenship applications are usually processed within months " interior minister -lsb- uwe -rsb- schuenemann is trying to carry out his discriminatory campaign against the left party by means of controlling citizenship rights , " she said .
and berlin political researcher hans-gerd jaschke said ' extremism ' " is n't a legal term . whether or not to call the left party extremist is a political assessment of the interior ministry . "
for its part , lower saxony 's interior ministry denies any political motivation for the decision , and a ministry spokesman pointed out that the party is under permanent surveillance in certain regions by the country 's intelligence agencies , which keep an eye out for terrorist and anarchist activity .
" the left party is a party on the extreme left wing of the party system , and it is watched over by the office for protection of the constitution in many german states , " ministry spokesman klaus engemann said .
perplexed and hurt the state is keeping the left party under watch because " there are serious doubts that the left party conforms to the german constitution - doubts that , on the contrary , it does n't want to override the state , " engemann said .
and it is why menger-hamilton 's political activity - she was the deputy treasurer for a party office in hanover - casts doubt on her willingness to adhere to german constitutional law , he added .
meanwhile , menger-hamilton said she is " perplexed " and " hurt " by the authorities ' reaction .
" i do n't know how they explain it ...
they do n't have any special reason against my person .
here is nothing that i have ever said or done which would indicate that i 'm not a democrat . "
now , she just has to wait for the final decision to come on whether or not the country where she was raised and went to school , where she studied german literature at university , and where she took her marriage vows , will someday let her cast a ballot .

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .
then we had " waiting for godot " by samuel beckett , which we renamed to " waiting for rain , " and the last project we did together was " women 's hammam . "
we worked on all plays with four groups and performed them in german , arabic , kurdish , and in persian or turkish . last year you used works by bertolt brecht and heiner mueller for the projects .

brecht did n't write about a local topic , even though you can turn a local topic into a world topic .

we have , for example , taken scenes from " the caucasian chalk circle " or from " mother courage , " and those are all foreign topics from places like russia , asia or greece .
and brecht , especially brecht , is in iraq - and i think in the east in general - a special figure in theatrical history , and almost every theater in iraq knows him and heiner mueller . for a long time , brecht was forbidden in iraq and that 's why his and mueller 's plays are especially suited to countries that have experienced a violent war and are being rebuilt .

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .
then we had " waiting for godot " by samuel beckett , which we renamed to " waiting for rain , " and the last project we did together was " women 's hammam . "
we worked on all plays with four groups and performed them in german , arabic , kurdish , and in persian or turkish . last year you used works by bertolt brecht and heiner mueller for the projects .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertolt brecht 's plays are well known in iraq of course , because i think these themes are global topics .
brecht did n't write about a local topic , even though you can turn a local topic into a world topic .
when you look at what heiner mueller or brecht wrote , most of the themes stem from neighboring or far-away countries .
we have , for example , taken scenes from " the caucasian chalk circle " or from " mother courage , " and those are all foreign topics from places like russia , asia or greece .
and brecht , especially brecht , is in iraq - and i think in the east in general - a special figure in theatrical history , and almost every theater in iraq knows him and heiner mueller . for a long time , brecht was forbidden in iraq and that 's why his and mueller 's plays are especially suited to countries that have experienced a violent war and are being rebuilt .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

" we do not think that negotiations have stranded and there 's still a possibility to reach a reasonable solution between the three nations , " she told reporters in reykjavik . " we still have something up our sleeves , " she told the reuters news agency after the conference .
late thursday , the latest round of talks fell apart between iceland , britain and the netherlands , over the repayment of $ 5.7 billion -lrb- 4.2 billion euros -rrb- lost by icelandic internet bank icesave .
referendum still on the cards iceland had planned a referendum on march 6 to decide whether to approve the terms of an icesave deal negotiated with the british and dutch governments last summer .
siguardottir said there was still a chance , albeit a slim one , to avoid the referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grimsson has turned the issue over to the people officials from all three countries have been meeting in london for the past two weeks to try and thrash out a consensus on how to return funds spent by britain and the netherlands to compensate their citizens ' depositors the icelandic internet bank , which collapsed with its parent landsbanki in october 2008 .
some 320,000 british and dutch savers were victims of the icesave collapse .
iceland 's president olafur ragnar grimsson has refused to sign legislation approved by parliament that would pay the two governments 3.8 billion euros for their reimbursements .
reykjavik rejected deal grimsson instead referred the issue to a referendum , citing public opposition , and opinion polls predicting the legislation would be rejected .
officials with knowledge of the talks said the main revision under discussion was a floating interest rate , replacing the 5.6 percent under the previous deal , ap news service reported .
such a rate could make it cheaper for iceland to repay its loans .
looking for next move a spokesman for the british treasury said his and the dutch governments were " disappointed " by the result .
" we have consistently supported iceland 's economic recovery and our latest proposal built upon this , " he said .
according to a source familiar with the situation , there are no new talks scheduled between iceland and the netherlands , so whether a deal can be reached is still unclear .
the latest developments could further threaten the likelihood of iceland joining the european union , as the uk and the netherlands have hinted that they will block accession talks with the north atlantic nation if the icesave issue is not resolved. ng / jen / reuters / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .
they are big boys and must succeed on their own . - malcolm clayton , canada greeks should learn to live within their means , tackle corruption and learn to work efficiently by achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense . - daniel maravei , canada the phrase from your article " violent protests and strikes : greeks oppose government plans " " … most schools and universities were closed … " is only partially true .
i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .

during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 26.02.2010 south america to create new eu-type bloc to defy us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez led the push for a new bloc the 24-strong bloc of latin american states known as the rio group is to join the caribbean community to form a new trade body intended to present opposition to us dominance .
what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "
in an interview with south american broadcaster telesur , bolivian president evo morales lent his own weight to the vision of a south american brotherhood united against the us .
morales was among many who recently voiced concern about the huge us military presence now stationed on haiti and the summit pledged to send a further $ 25 million -lrb- 18.5 million euros -rrb- to the earthquake-hit country .
" a union of latin american countries is the weapon against imperialism .
it is necessary to create a regional body that excludes the united states and canada , " morales said .
" where there are us military bases that do not respect democracy , where there is political empire with his blackmailers , with its constraints , there is no development for that country , and especially there is no social peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president calderon of mexico , third right , announced the birth of the new organization but the summit also revealed the many tensions likely to threaten the prospective new bloc .
the project nearly ran aground this week on the continuing conflict between neighboring venezuala and colombia .
colombia is considered a close ally of the us , and venezuela often perceives itself under threat . jamaican head of state bruce golding admitted that such tensions were unlikely to go away overnight .
" in the past , there were too many occasions where we fought one another .
but we still had to live in the same part of the world .
i hope that we find ways in the new community to talk about what divides us with the aim of achieving unity . "
doubts over south american strength but doubts have also been voiced about the strength and belligerence of the proposed body when it actually comes into being .
few specifics have been revealed about its structure , much of which is yet to be decided , and rafael fernandez de castro , calderon 's top foreign policy advisor , told the miami herald newspaper that the new organization will have neither a building or a permanent staff , and would operate according to a " flexible " program of summits - in other words , celc would convene either every one or two years .
on top of this , the six nations that have been chosen to draw up the new body 's mission statement - mexico , brazil , chile , jamaica , the dominican republic and venezuela - are mainly countries with no interest in antagonizing the us .
the fact that us-friendly chile takes over the two-year presidency of the group of rio in march is unlikely to sharpen tensions within the americas either .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "
thumbs up from the democrat party kraisak choonhavan , a member of the governing democrat party , praised the judiciary for the verdict .
" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "
but others are less sure .
thaksin gained his popularity through populist policies for the rural and urban poor but was accused by the urban middle class of corruption and abuse of power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crying supporters of deposed prime minister thaksin shinawatra , wearing read shirts red shirts keep coming back thitinan pongsudhirak , a political scientist at chulalongkorn university , says the verdict will do little to heal the deep political divisions in the country .
thaksin has been supported by groups who wear red shirts as identification .
" the verdict is only going to start a new cycle , another episode , turning the leaf for thailand 's political transformation .
thaksin has been an agent for that transformation .
he keeps coming back , along with his followers .
the red shirts keep coming back . "
red shirt groups have vowed to maintain pressure against the government with fresh demonstrations due to get underway in mid march in a bid to force the government of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to call new elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 26.02.2010 helping hand for german companies threatened by insolvency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mergermarket forum attracted managers from all over germany if you take the right steps even insolvency does not mean the death of a company .
shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been widely criticized . politiken is the first danish newspaper to offer an apology to muslims who were offended by what they deem disrespectful drawings of the prophet muhammad .
" we apologize to anyone who was offended by our decision to reprint the cartoon drawing , " the newspaper said in a statement on friday .
the paper has published an agreement with eight organizations from australia , egypt , jordan , lebanon , libya , qatar , saudi arabia and the palestinian territories , representing 94,923 descendants of the muslim prophet .
no regrets despite the apology , politiken says it does not regret printing the cartoons , but that it was sorry it had offended some muslims .
" we deplore that muslims were offended , even if that was not our intention , " editor-in-chief toeger seidenfaden said .
in august last year , 11 danish newspapers were approached by faisal yamani , the lawyer who represents the descendants , with demands that the cartoons be removed from the internet .

" it 's a sad day for danish media , it 's sad for freedom of expression , and it 's sad for politiken , " the chief editor of jyllands-posten , joern mikkelsen , wrote .
his paper had first published the cartoons in 2005 .
politicians also condemned the move .
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen told danish tv that the apology could be seen as " a break with the cohesion that existed in the media and in danish society . "
worldwide protests the most controversial of the 12 drawings was created by danish cartoonist knut westergaard , and showed the prophet wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse .
the cartoons ' publication sparked a wave of protests among muslims in syria , beirut , nigeria , sudan and other countries with large muslim populations .

" we apologize to anyone who was offended by our decision to reprint the cartoon drawing , " the newspaper said in a statement on friday .
the paper has published an agreement with eight organizations from australia , egypt , jordan , lebanon , libya , qatar , saudi arabia and the palestinian territories , representing 94,923 descendants of the muslim prophet .
no regrets despite the apology , politiken says it does not regret printing the cartoons , but that it was sorry it had offended some muslims .
" we deplore that muslims were offended , even if that was not our intention , " editor-in-chief toeger seidenfaden said .
in august last year , 11 danish newspapers were approached by faisal yamani , the lawyer who represents the descendants , with demands that the cartoons be removed from the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish daily jyllands-posten first published the cartoons in 2005 yamani also wanted an apology and a promise that the cartoons would not be printed again .
but politiken has reserved the right to reprint the cartoons .
move draws criticism politiken 's move has been widely criticized in denmark .
" it 's a sad day for danish media , it 's sad for freedom of expression , and it 's sad for politiken , " the chief editor of jyllands-posten , joern mikkelsen , wrote .
his paper had first published the cartoons in 2005 .
politicians also condemned the move .
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen told danish tv that the apology could be seen as " a break with the cohesion that existed in the media and in danish society . "
worldwide protests the most controversial of the 12 drawings was created by danish cartoonist knut westergaard , and showed the prophet wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse .
the cartoons ' publication sparked a wave of protests among muslims in syria , beirut , nigeria , sudan and other countries with large muslim populations .

shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "
thumbs up from the democrat party kraisak choonhavan , a member of the governing democrat party , praised the judiciary for the verdict .
" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "
but others are less sure .
thaksin gained his popularity through populist policies for the rural and urban poor but was accused by the urban middle class of corruption and abuse of power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crying supporters of deposed prime minister thaksin shinawatra , wearing read shirts red shirts keep coming back thitinan pongsudhirak , a political scientist at chulalongkorn university , says the verdict will do little to heal the deep political divisions in the country .
thaksin has been supported by groups who wear red shirts as identification .
" the verdict is only going to start a new cycle , another episode , turning the leaf for thailand 's political transformation .
thaksin has been an agent for that transformation .
he keeps coming back , along with his followers .
the red shirts keep coming back . "
red shirt groups have vowed to maintain pressure against the government with fresh demonstrations due to get underway in mid march in a bid to force the government of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to call new elections .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .
they are big boys and must succeed on their own . - malcolm clayton , canada greeks should learn to live within their means , tackle corruption and learn to work efficiently by achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense . - daniel maravei , canada the phrase from your article " violent protests and strikes : greeks oppose government plans " " … most schools and universities were closed … " is only partially true .
i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .
then we had " waiting for godot " by samuel beckett , which we renamed to " waiting for rain , " and the last project we did together was " women 's hammam . "
we worked on all plays with four groups and performed them in german , arabic , kurdish , and in persian or turkish . last year you used works by bertolt brecht and heiner mueller for the projects .
do these texts match the situation in iraq and are they understood there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertolt brecht 's plays are well known in iraq of course , because i think these themes are global topics .
brecht did n't write about a local topic , even though you can turn a local topic into a world topic .
when you look at what heiner mueller or brecht wrote , most of the themes stem from neighboring or far-away countries .
we have , for example , taken scenes from " the caucasian chalk circle " or from " mother courage , " and those are all foreign topics from places like russia , asia or greece .
and brecht , especially brecht , is in iraq - and i think in the east in general - a special figure in theatrical history , and almost every theater in iraq knows him and heiner mueller . for a long time , brecht was forbidden in iraq and that 's why his and mueller 's plays are especially suited to countries that have experienced a violent war and are being rebuilt .

a german organization is doing just that - through theater exchange projects . ihsan ohtmann works for the network for cultural reconstruction in iraq . deutsche welle : northern iraq in particular has suffered under the dictatorship and subsequent war .
does cultural reconstruction play a role here in re-establishing an identity ? ihsan ohtmann : originally , theater in kurdistan in iraq was as cultural movement , a form of resistance against the dictatorship .
just like other ethnic groups , the kurds want to express themselves , and theater is a way of doing that . you work together with german institutions , such as theaters in berlin .
what type of plays do you perform in kurdistan ? i work with the theaterhaus mitte and it germania and the goethe institute , and together we made theater our focus in 2006 , as part of a cultural exchange project .
since then , we have participated in regular theater exchanges with iraq and especially kurdistan . our first topic was " death and the maiden " by ariel dorman from chile .
then we had " waiting for godot " by samuel beckett , which we renamed to " waiting for rain , " and the last project we did together was " women 's hammam . "
we worked on all plays with four groups and performed them in german , arabic , kurdish , and in persian or turkish . last year you used works by bertolt brecht and heiner mueller for the projects .
do these texts match the situation in iraq and are they understood there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertolt brecht 's plays are well known in iraq of course , because i think these themes are global topics .
brecht did n't write about a local topic , even though you can turn a local topic into a world topic .
when you look at what heiner mueller or brecht wrote , most of the themes stem from neighboring or far-away countries .
we have , for example , taken scenes from " the caucasian chalk circle " or from " mother courage , " and those are all foreign topics from places like russia , asia or greece .
and brecht , especially brecht , is in iraq - and i think in the east in general - a special figure in theatrical history , and almost every theater in iraq knows him and heiner mueller . for a long time , brecht was forbidden in iraq and that 's why his and mueller 's plays are especially suited to countries that have experienced a violent war and are being rebuilt .

i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .
they are big boys and must succeed on their own . - malcolm clayton , canada greeks should learn to live within their means , tackle corruption and learn to work efficiently by achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense . - daniel maravei , canada the phrase from your article " violent protests and strikes : greeks oppose government plans " " … most schools and universities were closed … " is only partially true .
i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "

" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

an extradition hearing is set for march 18 , he said .
turkish authorities believe adir , who lives in germany , is a leading member of the kurdistan workers ' party , or pkk .
the separatist party is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the european union , and the united states .
plan to protest the arrest took place on january 19 , adir 's lawyer bart nooitgedacht told germany 's dpa news agency .
now , ankara has requested his extradition to turkey .
the dutch justice ministry confirmed the arrest and the date of the extradition hearing .
nooitgedacht said his client would fight any move to extratdite him , due to fears that he would be tortured or killed in turkey .
he claims turkish officials tortured him in the past and that he fled to germany after several of his relatives were killed .
nooitgedacht also said germany had effectively acknowledged that his client 's fears were legitimate and thus had refused to extradite him .
" a german court has already established my client runs the risk of being tortured .
turkey considers him to be a state risk and as someone who can provide information about a terrorist organization , " nooitgedacht said. jen / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "
in an interview with south american broadcaster telesur , bolivian president evo morales lent his own weight to the vision of a south american brotherhood united against the us .
morales was among many who recently voiced concern about the huge us military presence now stationed on haiti and the summit pledged to send a further $ 25 million -lrb- 18.5 million euros -rrb- to the earthquake-hit country .
" a union of latin american countries is the weapon against imperialism .
it is necessary to create a regional body that excludes the united states and canada , " morales said .
" where there are us military bases that do not respect democracy , where there is political empire with his blackmailers , with its constraints , there is no development for that country , and especially there is no social peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president calderon of mexico , third right , announced the birth of the new organization but the summit also revealed the many tensions likely to threaten the prospective new bloc .
the project nearly ran aground this week on the continuing conflict between neighboring venezuala and colombia .
colombia is considered a close ally of the us , and venezuela often perceives itself under threat . jamaican head of state bruce golding admitted that such tensions were unlikely to go away overnight .
" in the past , there were too many occasions where we fought one another .
but we still had to live in the same part of the world .
i hope that we find ways in the new community to talk about what divides us with the aim of achieving unity . "
doubts over south american strength but doubts have also been voiced about the strength and belligerence of the proposed body when it actually comes into being .
few specifics have been revealed about its structure , much of which is yet to be decided , and rafael fernandez de castro , calderon 's top foreign policy advisor , told the miami herald newspaper that the new organization will have neither a building or a permanent staff , and would operate according to a " flexible " program of summits - in other words , celc would convene either every one or two years .
on top of this , the six nations that have been chosen to draw up the new body 's mission statement - mexico , brazil , chile , jamaica , the dominican republic and venezuela - are mainly countries with no interest in antagonizing the us .
the fact that us-friendly chile takes over the two-year presidency of the group of rio in march is unlikely to sharpen tensions within the americas either .

shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .

he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 26.02.2010 helping hand for german companies threatened by insolvency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mergermarket forum attracted managers from all over germany if you take the right steps even insolvency does not mean the death of a company .
shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

the statement is the latest move in an ongoing diplomatic row . gadhafi said that any muslim who worked with switzerland was against the prophet mohammad and the koran , referring to a swiss referendum verdict barring the construction of minarets , the spires that sit atop mosques .
an eu spokesman called the comment " unfortunate . "
" the masses of muslims must go to all airports in the islamic world and prevent any swiss plane landing , to all harbors and prevent any swiss ships docking , inspect all shops and markets to stop any swiss goods being sold , " gadhafi said during a meeting in the eastern libyan city of benghazi .
eu comments " let us fight against switzerland , zionism and foreign aggression , " said gadhafi , adding that " this is not terrorism , " in contrast with the work of al-qaida which he called a " kind of crime and a psychological disease . "
" there is a big difference between terrorism and jihad , which is a right to armed struggle , " he added .
the swiss foreign ministry declined to comment on gadhafi 's remarks .
but the spokesman for the european union 's chief of foreign affiars , catherine ashton , said he regretted the comments .
" if these reports are correct ... -lrb- they -rrb- come at an unfortunate moment when the european union is working closely with switzerland trying to reach a diplomatic solution " to a long runing battle between the two countries , lutz guellner told afp news service .
tit-for-tat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland banned the construction of minarets following a referendum gadhafi 's call comes amid an ongoing visa row between libya and switzerland , with bern refusing to lift a blacklist on around 200 top libyan officials , including gadhafi and his family .
libya reacted by announcing that it would refuse to issue entry visas to most citizens of the european union , although switzerland is not a member of the 27-nation bloc .
switzerland is however among the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gadhafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing around $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks. dfm / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

'
but is it really ?
this month has seen german no-frills supermarket lidl embroiled in a food poisoning scandal that killed six customers , infected several more and hoisted a question mark over the safety of discount food products . it took several weeks for investigators to trace the fatal bacterial infections , which occurred in austria and southern germany last year , to the same food source .
with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "
same system for one and all moreover , he said manufacturers , retailers and gastronomists in germany are all subject to the same safety and hygiene regulations , no matter how big , small , cheap or expensive the establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what 's in the box , the same safety and hygiene standards apply yet while there is no obvious way for discounters to cut corners , ruecker says german quality controls leave a lot to be desired .
not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .
in search of transparency that being the case , ruecker believes the only real solution is transparency .
if consumers were informed , say by a notice in the window or an online register , retailers who were not putting the interests of the public first would be exposed , and consumers would be free to make informed choices .
but dr edwin ernst , consumer safety expert with the baden-wuerttemberg ministry for food and agriculture , told deutsche welle it is not the only job of the authorities to regulate hygiene standards .
bildunterschrift : food saftey inspectors ca n't be everywhere at once " controls are only the tip of the iceberg , " he said .
" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 26.02.2010 south america to create new eu-type bloc to defy us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez led the push for a new bloc the 24-strong bloc of latin american states known as the rio group is to join the caribbean community to form a new trade body intended to present opposition to us dominance .
what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "
in an interview with south american broadcaster telesur , bolivian president evo morales lent his own weight to the vision of a south american brotherhood united against the us .
morales was among many who recently voiced concern about the huge us military presence now stationed on haiti and the summit pledged to send a further $ 25 million -lrb- 18.5 million euros -rrb- to the earthquake-hit country .
" a union of latin american countries is the weapon against imperialism .
it is necessary to create a regional body that excludes the united states and canada , " morales said .
" where there are us military bases that do not respect democracy , where there is political empire with his blackmailers , with its constraints , there is no development for that country , and especially there is no social peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president calderon of mexico , third right , announced the birth of the new organization but the summit also revealed the many tensions likely to threaten the prospective new bloc .
the project nearly ran aground this week on the continuing conflict between neighboring venezuala and colombia .
colombia is considered a close ally of the us , and venezuela often perceives itself under threat . jamaican head of state bruce golding admitted that such tensions were unlikely to go away overnight .
" in the past , there were too many occasions where we fought one another .
but we still had to live in the same part of the world .
i hope that we find ways in the new community to talk about what divides us with the aim of achieving unity . "
doubts over south american strength but doubts have also been voiced about the strength and belligerence of the proposed body when it actually comes into being .
few specifics have been revealed about its structure , much of which is yet to be decided , and rafael fernandez de castro , calderon 's top foreign policy advisor , told the miami herald newspaper that the new organization will have neither a building or a permanent staff , and would operate according to a " flexible " program of summits - in other words , celc would convene either every one or two years .
on top of this , the six nations that have been chosen to draw up the new body 's mission statement - mexico , brazil , chile , jamaica , the dominican republic and venezuela - are mainly countries with no interest in antagonizing the us .
the fact that us-friendly chile takes over the two-year presidency of the group of rio in march is unlikely to sharpen tensions within the americas either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 26.02.2010 1.4 billion dollars of thaksin 's assets to be seized : thai court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reading of the verdict took more than six hours on friday former thai prime minister , thaksin shinawatra and associates , including family , have been found guilty of abuse of power , with the court ruling to seize more than one billion dollars in assets .
concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "
thumbs up from the democrat party kraisak choonhavan , a member of the governing democrat party , praised the judiciary for the verdict .
" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "
but others are less sure .
thaksin gained his popularity through populist policies for the rural and urban poor but was accused by the urban middle class of corruption and abuse of power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crying supporters of deposed prime minister thaksin shinawatra , wearing read shirts red shirts keep coming back thitinan pongsudhirak , a political scientist at chulalongkorn university , says the verdict will do little to heal the deep political divisions in the country .
thaksin has been supported by groups who wear red shirts as identification .
" the verdict is only going to start a new cycle , another episode , turning the leaf for thailand 's political transformation .
thaksin has been an agent for that transformation .
he keeps coming back , along with his followers .
the red shirts keep coming back . "
red shirt groups have vowed to maintain pressure against the government with fresh demonstrations due to get underway in mid march in a bid to force the government of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to call new elections .

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

'
but is it really ?
this month has seen german no-frills supermarket lidl embroiled in a food poisoning scandal that killed six customers , infected several more and hoisted a question mark over the safety of discount food products . it took several weeks for investigators to trace the fatal bacterial infections , which occurred in austria and southern germany last year , to the same food source .
with the help of till receipts , they were eventually led to the austrian firm , prolactal , and to a range of cheese products sold by lidl discount supermarkets .
in a statement released after the revelation , lidl said it had reacted immediately by issuing nationwide recalls of the suspect products .
on its website it urged customers to avoid eating them at all cost .
but by that point , irreparable damage had already been done .
there is no way to turn back time , no way to undo things , but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding food safety and the quality of discounter products .
is it really a case of getting what you pay for ?
martin ruecker , spokesman with the consumer protection organization foodwatch , told deutsche welle that when it comes to food , the simple answer is " no . "
" price is not an indication of quality , " he said .
" it is dictated by marketing costs , and it stands to reason that they will be higher for branded products than no-name goods . "
same system for one and all moreover , he said manufacturers , retailers and gastronomists in germany are all subject to the same safety and hygiene regulations , no matter how big , small , cheap or expensive the establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what 's in the box , the same safety and hygiene standards apply yet while there is no obvious way for discounters to cut corners , ruecker says german quality controls leave a lot to be desired .
not least the fact that they are all conducted anonymously .
" in denmark , the results of hygiene tests are hung up in the window of the premises for customers to see , but we do n't do anything like that here . "
he says such practices would not only help to raise standards , but would also give the public the insight they deserve into the truth of what they consume .
" take pesticides for example , " ruecker said .
" we 've seen cases where paprika has tested positive for high levels of pesticides , but where the product has not been taken off the shelf . "
in such cases , it is not the retailer who is liable , but the famer , and the very nature of global agriculture makes it hard to locate and bring to account the culprits .
in search of transparency that being the case , ruecker believes the only real solution is transparency .
if consumers were informed , say by a notice in the window or an online register , retailers who were not putting the interests of the public first would be exposed , and consumers would be free to make informed choices .
but dr edwin ernst , consumer safety expert with the baden-wuerttemberg ministry for food and agriculture , told deutsche welle it is not the only job of the authorities to regulate hygiene standards .
bildunterschrift : food saftey inspectors ca n't be everywhere at once " controls are only the tip of the iceberg , " he said .
" companies have to come up with internal regulation concepts based on knowledge about the types of problems they might face and ways to deal with them . " such concepts , he said , help inspectors see which businesses - manufacturers , importers or retailers - need to be closely watched and which require less monitoring .
and contrary to some public assumptions in light of the lidl cheese scandal , ernst says it is rarely the big retailers that score low points with hygiene and safety inspectors .
" you are more likely to find grubby conditions in a small business , " he told deutsche welle .
" big companies have much more to lose , so they consequently expect higher standards from their suppliers . "
cheap shopping thrills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoppers have a love affair with discount supermarkets certainly up until this week there was no evidence to suggest that german shoppers had anything but faith in the likes of lidl and its no-frills domestic competitors .
collectively the five main discounters - aldi , lidl , netto , penny and norma - have the lion 's share of the country 's retail food market , which is somewhat paradoxical given that the forecourts of said stores are often filled with big-name cars .
but as the saying goes , germany is the only country in the world where you wear armani for a trip to aldi .
or , as ruecker says , it is logical that consumers should want to get a good deal for their meals regardless of their disposable income .
" in the case of cars , you can see the difference between models and you know what you 're getting for your money .
but when you buy a liter of milk from aldi or from a more expensive supermarket , there is no indication that one product is better than the other . "

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "

" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "

" i really like to congratulate the judiciary system .
it would certainly mark a precedent for the future governance of thailand that is one of the most important landmarks in thai history . "
but others are less sure .
thaksin gained his popularity through populist policies for the rural and urban poor but was accused by the urban middle class of corruption and abuse of power .

thaksin has been an agent for that transformation .
he keeps coming back , along with his followers .

red shirt groups have vowed to maintain pressure against the government with fresh demonstrations due to get underway in mid march in a bid to force the government of prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to call new elections .

concerns remain the verdict will do little to ease political tensions in the country . the verdict took over six hours to read among the judges .
the panel of nine supreme court judges , amid tight security , friday ruled that former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra had abused his power while in office to the advantage of family-linked companies and businesses .
in the majority ruling that was broadcast on radio and television , the judges called for the seizure of 1.4 billion dollars in assets of thaksin 's more than 2.3 billion dollars currently frozen by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra was ousted in 2006 and is living in exile thaksin held power for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
the military-backed government launched an investigation through a special committee led by the country 's auditor general and senior judges .
the investigation was later taken over the national counter corruption commission .
constitutional breach the court said thaksin had breached the constitution by not reducing or disposing the shares in his family-run shin corp. to less than five per cent .
according to the judges , thaksin and his former wife pojaman had concealed their shareholding .
this was in contravention of the constitution that prohibits conflicts of interests .
thaksin had earlier appealed to his supporters to stay calm while he remains in exile after having fled the country in 2008 ahead of a court verdict that found him guilty of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in jail .
pasuk pongphaichit , a political economist and author , says the verdict reflects how many had hoped thaksin would use his business skills for the progress of the country .
" mr. thaksin had disappointed a lot of people in the sense that in the end he was just a businessman who had liked to buy cheap and sell dear for profit and thinking of little else . "

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .
they are big boys and must succeed on their own . - malcolm clayton , canada greeks should learn to live within their means , tackle corruption and learn to work efficiently by achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense . - daniel maravei , canada the phrase from your article " violent protests and strikes : greeks oppose government plans " " … most schools and universities were closed … " is only partially true .
i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .
they are big boys and must succeed on their own . - malcolm clayton , canada greeks should learn to live within their means , tackle corruption and learn to work efficiently by achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense . - daniel maravei , canada the phrase from your article " violent protests and strikes : greeks oppose government plans " " … most schools and universities were closed … " is only partially true .
i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .

i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an extradition hearing is set for march 18 , he said .
turkish authorities believe adir , who lives in germany , is a leading member of the kurdistan workers ' party , or pkk .
the separatist party is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the european union , and the united states .
plan to protest the arrest took place on january 19 , adir 's lawyer bart nooitgedacht told germany 's dpa news agency .
now , ankara has requested his extradition to turkey .
the dutch justice ministry confirmed the arrest and the date of the extradition hearing .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .
a win would have moved dortmund into fourth place ahead of hamburg , but instead they stay in fifth , four points ahead of werder bremen. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 26.02.2010 south america to create new eu-type bloc to defy us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez led the push for a new bloc the 24-strong bloc of latin american states known as the rio group is to join the caribbean community to form a new trade body intended to present opposition to us dominance .
what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "
in an interview with south american broadcaster telesur , bolivian president evo morales lent his own weight to the vision of a south american brotherhood united against the us .
morales was among many who recently voiced concern about the huge us military presence now stationed on haiti and the summit pledged to send a further $ 25 million -lrb- 18.5 million euros -rrb- to the earthquake-hit country .
" a union of latin american countries is the weapon against imperialism .
it is necessary to create a regional body that excludes the united states and canada , " morales said .
" where there are us military bases that do not respect democracy , where there is political empire with his blackmailers , with its constraints , there is no development for that country , and especially there is no social peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president calderon of mexico , third right , announced the birth of the new organization but the summit also revealed the many tensions likely to threaten the prospective new bloc .
the project nearly ran aground this week on the continuing conflict between neighboring venezuala and colombia .
colombia is considered a close ally of the us , and venezuela often perceives itself under threat . jamaican head of state bruce golding admitted that such tensions were unlikely to go away overnight .
" in the past , there were too many occasions where we fought one another .
but we still had to live in the same part of the world .
i hope that we find ways in the new community to talk about what divides us with the aim of achieving unity . "
doubts over south american strength but doubts have also been voiced about the strength and belligerence of the proposed body when it actually comes into being .
few specifics have been revealed about its structure , much of which is yet to be decided , and rafael fernandez de castro , calderon 's top foreign policy advisor , told the miami herald newspaper that the new organization will have neither a building or a permanent staff , and would operate according to a " flexible " program of summits - in other words , celc would convene either every one or two years .
on top of this , the six nations that have been chosen to draw up the new body 's mission statement - mexico , brazil , chile , jamaica , the dominican republic and venezuela - are mainly countries with no interest in antagonizing the us .
the fact that us-friendly chile takes over the two-year presidency of the group of rio in march is unlikely to sharpen tensions within the americas either .

what can it really hope to achieve ? the rio group assertively announced the birth of its successor earlier this week , at a summit in a resort town on mexico 's caribbean coast .
mexican president felipe calderon declared that a new body had been formed that would represent both the group of rio and the 15-member caribbean community -lrb- caricom -rrb- .
going under the provisional name the community of latin american and caribbean states -lrb- celc -rrb- , the newly announced body specifically excluded the united states and canada from membership , and intends to consolidate the sometimes tenuous solidarity among the central and south american states .
the exclusion of the two north american powerhouses puts the nascent organization in direct competition with the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , established in 1948 , over which the us holds decisive authority .
the declaration is clearly a statement of south america 's new self-assertion , and comes in the wake of provocative times , as fellow rio group states rallied around argentina in its current dispute with britain over oil-drilling rights off the falkland islands .
bildunterschrift : the rio group and caricom convened at a mexican seaside resort near cancun nikolaus werz , political scientist at the university of rostock , believes that the emergence of the new body will only make europe 's diplomatic ties with latin america more complicated .
" we need a single point of contact , and this adds another to the long list we already have - the rio group , oas , caricom and unasur , " he told deutsche welle .
almost every latin american country was represented at the annual summit in mexico , and together they succeeded in formulating some of the values of the sub-continent .
calderon declared , " we have decided to base an organization on shared values including sovereignty and the non-use of force , including threats of force , international cooperation , ever closer integration of latin america and the caribbean and permanent political dialogue . "
historical rhetoric there was no shortage of high-flown and defiant rhetoric at the meeting , led predictably by venezuelan president hugo chavez , who spoke of finally throwing off the us-yoke .
" now here , in mexico , we have created a document , a compromise , the creation of a body of latin america and the caribbean , without the usa , " chavez said at the summit .
" now we can say from mexico we have revived the dream and project of bolivar . "
there was a strong sense that the region 's most left-wing , anti-american governments had pioneered the creation of the new organization , which is set to convene for the first time on july 5 , 2011 , in caracas , venezuela .
but werz also suggested that the us 's influence on the sub-continent had waned in recent years anyway .
" the oas failed as it tried to take on certain challenges , " he said .
" other players have increased their presence in south america , notably china , but also the eu . "

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i 'll not buy german products again .
everything is made in germany or shops like lidl .
when the eu paid for the unification of eastern with western germany , then the greek taxpayers should have said " no ! "
germans are the deceivers of the eu by selling low quality tanks and submarines to greece and then refusing to give back the money !
germans are not as pure as they want to seem !
with the euro they destroyed our economies .
our products became expensive and our factories closed . - nicholas fountzilas , greece " there are lies , damned lies and greek statistics . "
does any normal person have any confidence whatsoever that successive greek governments will make any real attempt to reform their country 's finances ?
they have been playing a game of what is effectively state fraud for far too long , abetted by the likes of goldman sachs .
it 's high time they faced the consequences in full .
as to the us banks involved , they should be punished by access denial to eu markets . - mike , poland i would n't be surprised if focus magazine was paid by the greek government in an effort to derail the discussion of the greek economy towards anti-german anachronisms .
any reference to germany is usually accompanied by nazi images .
discussions are orbiting the money owed by germany for reparations and the savage acts committed against civilians by german soldiers during the occupation .
focus magazine severely overstepped the bounds and tensions have sparked .
most unfortunate is the fact that the eu is seen as an occupying force and in a very sudden but certain way the greeks are privately contemplating going to the american-run imf for economic help .
this crisis has put the very fabric of the eu under considerable stress .
the inability of the european community to manage crises is more pronounced than ever .
make no mistake this " greek crisis " can tear the eu to shreds , and if it were n't the greeks it would be the spaniards , the irish or italians .
it seems that europeans are " friends " only in happiness . - stratos , greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' swindlers in the euro-family ' was the first salvo help this country overcome its problems with food and work .
they are big boys and must succeed on their own . - malcolm clayton , canada greeks should learn to live within their means , tackle corruption and learn to work efficiently by achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense . - daniel maravei , canada the phrase from your article " violent protests and strikes : greeks oppose government plans " " … most schools and universities were closed … " is only partially true .
i work in the administration of the secondary education in one of the largest prefectures with 3,000 teachers , and i can responsibly inform you that there was only 10-percent participation in the strike .
all the schools were open . - motsios theodoros , greece the proposed bailout is a scandal .
the greeks need to be punished by excluding them from the eu and the euro zone and not bailed-out !
what they have done is criminal .
furthermore , they will do it again .
has anybody considered that ?
shame on you germany ! - arthur ralli , great britain there have been a number of articles and opinions in the german media and political scene , fueling a quasi-hate campaign against the " greek thieves " in the " euro-family . "
to the extent that it appears as though greeks live off germans money .
yes , it 's true that big-time corruption has taken a heavy toll in greece , but it is ordinary greeks who have been exploited by corrupt ruling elite .
it is ordinary greeks who are paid low wages .
it is ordinary greeks who have a nearly non-existent welfare state , wrecked education system and poor healthcare .
it is not the german taxpayer .
further , arguing about whether germany will " foot the bill " for greece seems terribly manipulative , since any help would take the form of loans , or guarantees that are repaid back with interest .
that is not exactly a blank check signed by the german taxpayer .
further , loans taken out by greece through the bond market are providing an actual investment for german banks who are harnessing the high interest rates greece has to pay .
and all this seems all the more hypocritical when german exports are fuelled by a weak euro for which again greece should be punished .
as for the discussion on the world war , the issue of the " occupation loans " remains one of the greatest injustices , and yet no one seems to mention it .
during the german occupation , besides the state of ruin and misery greece was reduced to , it had equally been economically robbed by germany .
this is apart from the issue of war reparations for the loss of lives , wealth or property , which were partly settled .
it is about the enforced payments made by greece to germany , in order to finance the german war operations .
they took the form of loans which the bank of greece was ordered to issue to germany , and which were never paid back .
these amounted to roughly 20 billion euros .
these are historical facts , well recorded .
even if greece has never officially ceased to claim them , one guesses that the feeling of solidarity among partners in a common european vision in recent years seemed to sideline these issues and quite rightly so .
it seems however that this kind of solidarity is no more , as german officials never fail to mention every time they try to " correct " misbehaving greece ; justice and fair play seem to have replaced it .
well then , would it not be only just if greeks start reminding germany that it is actually greek money that contributed to german postwar growth , while starving the greek economy at a time that it needed it most - to recover from the destruction germany left behind ?
next time german officials or media rush to say " not one euro for the greeks , " they 'd better be reminded of a 20-billion debt their country owes to the greek people .
fair play . - yiorgos , great britain i want to apologize for the behavior of greece against our german friends who through all the last years helped us and stood by our country .
i consider germany a good friend of greece and one of the most civilized and progressive countries .
in every visit to germany i met only polite and nice , friendly people .
to my ears statements like " you owe us money from the nazi years " seem ridiculous and humiliating for my country .
i feel shame for the third-world country behavior of my country . - kostas dretakis , greece compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the loss leaves dortmund in fifth place . both teams played frenetic derby football in the first half , with neither able to capitalize on their possession .
dortmund broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half after being awarded a penalty when schalke midfielder ivan rakitic was judged to have fouled nelson valdez in the box .
nuri sahin slotted past keeper manuel neuer with ease .
the goal sparked schalke back into action , and , after yellow cards to valdez and schalke 's kevin kuranyi from separate incidents , the gelsenkirchen club equalized in the 66th minute through benedikt hoewedes .
hoewedes out-jumped two dortmund defenders to head the goal after a lukas schmitz free kick from the right .
dortmund , without leading scorer lucas barrios , had a chance to take the lead in the 81st minute after a breakaway run , but schalke defender rafinha got back in time to thwart the movement .
two minutes later croatian rakitic atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by firing home a well-placed side-foot from the edge of the keeper 's box .
the win moves schalke to within one point of bayern munich and league leaders leverkusen , who sit atop the bundesliga on goal difference .
both can extend their leads to four points with wins this weekend over hamburg and cologne respectively .
a win would have moved dortmund into fourth place ahead of hamburg , but instead they stay in fifth , four points ahead of werder bremen. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .

playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "

but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 26.02.2010 helping hand for german companies threatened by insolvency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mergermarket forum attracted managers from all over germany if you take the right steps even insolvency does not mean the death of a company .
shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .
" we see a fair number of companies founded shortly after the war that need new capital and new shareholders , " he added .
german businesses are particularly amenable to restructuring when the need arises , according to christoph kauter , ceo of tig .
" many german management teams realize the situation is tough and they are very open to downscaling , although maybe not as rigorously and as quickly as is possible under us or uk labor law , " he said .
furthermore , the environment for making investments in germany is becoming a lot better .
in terms of deal volume , mergermarket statistics show that m & a activity is on the rise again .
" visibility of revenues and earnings streams have massively increased compared to 12 months ago , when all sectors were showing massive revenue drops from month to month .
now we 're acting much quicker and intend to do at least four acquisitions in 2010 , " said kauter .
overall the mood in germany remains positive , then , despite the odd tremor in the financial markets .

shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .
both honsel and ruwel were scuppered by the automotive crisis , rather than a bad business model , but that is where the similarities end .
ruwel 's shareholders decided to walk away , forcing the company to file for insolvency in february 2009 .
insolvency is not the end of the world but insolvency does not necessarily mean the end of a company ; much to the relief of ruwel 's managing director thomas wittig .
he told forum delegates how the appointment of german jurist horst piepenburg as insolvency administrator brought fresh hope .
piepenburg was famously taken on as bankruptcy manager last year for the insolvency of arcandor , owner of karstadt , germany 's biggest chain of department stores .
despite all media predictions to the contrary , ruwel managed to come out smiling .
" from day one of the insolvency process ruwel began actively communicating with its stakeholders and got back to positive cash results , " wittig said .
even the finance minister of north rhine-westphalia , helmut linssen , got involved in the process .
trouble-shooters other companies in germany are not only suffering from the general economic downturn , but also from their own structural problems .
aurelius and themis industries group -lrb- tig -rrb- are two financial investors that help put beleaguered companies back on their feet .
unlike many other private equity investors , these groups make their money out of the value potential in severely distressed firms unable to manage themselves effectively .
both investors had representatives at the conference who dished out tips on how to avoid financial extinction .
blighted by years of bickering amongst its 47 shareholders , beverage company berentzen is a case in point .
if aurelieus had not stepped in to buy the 250-year-old company , it is doubtful the business would still be around today .
despite being faced with a company under increasing pressure from banks , financial sponsors , unions and employees , as well as 22 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- in debt , aurelieus managing director dirk markus still saw plenty of potential in berentzen .
he nursed the company back to profitability through focusing on a few key brands .
" historically berentzen had more than 78 brands , some of them very small with miniscule volumes , " he said .
besides streamlining production , aurelieus also internationalized the group and started a new advertising campaign , currently running on german tv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph kauter offered struggling companies expert advice recession and succession there are many other german companies under financial strain from both the recession and succession issues , particularly older ones .
" these two things combined can cause enormous problems , " markus noted .

shareholder communication is paramount to survival , as delegates learned at mergermarket 's latest restructuring forum in dusseldorf . a company going into distress because of poor management is one thing , but what happens when a whole sector has been hit by the downturn ?
or , worse still , what happens when poor management comes on top of a downturn ?
that 's what 200 corporates and financial specialists from all over germany convened to discuss in dusseldorf earlier this week at mergermarket 's mergers & acquisitions and restructuring forum .
the crisis in the car industry has claimed its share of victims , and some have been luckier than others .
one of these is honsel , a century-old german light metal component manufacturer for the automotive sector that narrowly escaped insolvency .
honsel chief financial officer stefan eck talked forum delegates through the company 's actions when revenues fell by 50 percent at the end of 2008 .
" as soon as trouble hit , we contacted all the major stakeholders , lender groups , customers and employees .
we decided to go into a standstill agreement and to work out an operational restructuring plan , " he explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan eck described his company 's narrow escape fortunately , honsel managed to convince its majority shareholders to contribute fresh money , its lenders to waive a huge portion of the company debt and its customers to help with price guarantees and loans .
although the worst is over , eck admitted that sales volumes are still low .
" we 're 40 percent down from our peak year so recovery is slow , but we have stabilized the company .
now we have to be patient and wait for the market to come back , " he remarked .
eck had the following advice for distressed companies : " do n't drag things out .
as soon as you get into problems , talk to all the stakeholders involved , act early and act professionally . "
ruwel is another german car component manufacturer to suffered a 50 percent drop in sales at the end of 2008 .

at least 17 people have died , among them up to nine indian citizens according to the indian foreign minister .
the assault was carried out in a hotel frequented by indian nationals .
it raises the question once again whether the war in afghanistan is slowly turning into more of a proxy battle between india and pakistan . suicide bombings have become part of every-day life in afghanistan .
in mid-january the taliban killed 12 people in an attack on several government buildings in kabul .
it is clear that suicide bombers are targeting indian establishments more frequently .
in the past year and a half , two terrorist attacks have been carried out on the indian embassy in the afghan capital .
the spokesman of the afghan president , hamed helmi says there is no special meaning behind the location of the attacks .
" terrorists attack wherever they can .
it has little to do with our relationship to our neighbor .
today they attacked kabul , not too long ago it was mumbai , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer looks at the body of an unidentified man lying in the rubble at the scene of an explosion and soon they will find some other place for an attack .
they are at war with the whole world . "
tug of war over afghanistan what helmi is reluctant to utter is well known among experts : islamabad and delhi are competing for influence in afghanistan .
currently india is one of the largest investors in afghanistan .
india fears that the taliban will return to power .
some people believe that they still receive support from parts of the pakistani government and military .
and islamabad vehemently criticizes india 's growing influence in afghanistan .
afghanistan expert conrad schetter sees a link between the latest bombing and the official talks that india and pakistan held in new delhi on thursday , just one day before .
" afghanistan has been part of the india-pakistan conflict for a long time .
we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

we have a situation , in which pakistan accuses india of promoting the separatist baloch movement through afghanistan .
on the other hand , pakistan is trying to secure strategic depth in afghanistan , especially with regard to the kashmir conflict .
now that the talks have taken place between india and pakistan , there are certain forces , especially in pakistan , who are showing their opposition against the talks and are therefore trying to extend the combat zone to afghanistan . "
pakistan between a rock and a hard place schetter knows that pakistan , which has fought several wars against india , is extremely afraid of losing kabul to delhi .
" for the past 50 years pakistan has been worried about getting crushed between the two countries .
on the one hand there is the conflict over kashmir , because it still is not clear whether kashmir belongs to india or pakistan , and on the other hand , there is the pashtun problem on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , which is also disputed .
so pakistan is worried that both conflicts could escalate and it would be caught between its two enemies . "
bildunterschrift : afghan soldiers and other security men stand guard near the place where the assault happened the question is whether it will ever be possible for the us and nato to secure peace in afghanistan under these circumstances .
" i believe that obama made the right move a year ago , " says schetter , " when he recognized that afghanistan and pakistan are basically one ' afpak ' conflict .
in my opinion it is vital to take these underlying issues of pashtunistan and kashmir seriously and try to find solutions that everyone can accept . "
but schetter adds that the international community is still far from thinking along these lines and will need some time to come up with comprehensive strategies to tackle the conflicts in south asia .

sex sells for germany 's best-selling tabloid and needless to say " bild-girls , " as they are known , are a main attraction of the paper 's new iphone application .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iphone bild-girl is a much tamer version of her paper counterpart users can shake their iphone to slowly undress the models .
however , the virtual bild-girls are much more modest than their paper counterparts ; a slinky bikini is the most viewers will ever see in the virtual version of bild .
one could call this self-censorship .
the taming of the bild-girls comes at a time when apple has banned thousands of iphone applications that feature sexually suggestive material .
in germany , apple 's " no-nipples " -policy has triggered a debate that goes much further than whether it is tasteless to undress a virtual model or not .
german publishers are up in arms over the california company 's censorship policies .
the question at stake is whether a provider of technical infrastructure should be allowed to interfere with the content offered via its platform .
apple says it reacts to complaints " today it may just be the rejection of too much nudity , " said wolfgang fuerstner , director of the organization of german magazine publishers .
" but in the future this could go much further to where apple simply blocks all content they do n't like . "
apple has justified its actions and stated that the company has reacted to complaints from app store users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang fuerstner wants to push apple for guarantees of editorial freedom " it came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , " philip w. schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at apple told the new york times .
playboy and sports illustrated not affected according to analyst gene munster at piper jaffray " apple has a brand to maintain . "
" the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean , " he told the new york times in an interview .
munster estimated that about 5 percent of the over 140,000 apps in the app store are sex related .
but even after apple 's ban , iphone and ipod touch are not 100 percent family friendly .
through the pre-installed safari browser , users – including kids - can easily access the internet and the millions of websites that contain pornography and violence .
and while banning thousands of less prominent applications that contain nudity , the apps of playboy and sports illustrated are still online .
it is this alleged arbitrary way of deciding , which worries german publishers .
they now want to push apple to implement more transparent rules .
for wolfgang fuerstner apple 's reaction will determine to what extent germany 's news media will work together with the californian company .
" i can not think of anyone who will accept apple setting the conditions for editorial freedom , " he told deutsche welle .
" no one will sell the right of freedom of the press to a company . "
