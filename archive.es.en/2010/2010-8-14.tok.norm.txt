the general debate over the future of german nuclear power has heated up again . controversial negotiations are underway in germany between the government and energy providers as companies threaten to shut down their nuclear power plants over a proposed tax on fuel rods and germany 's debate over its nuclear energy future reignites . news magazine der spiegel reported that the operators of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants - rwe , e.on , vattenfall and enbw - have said they will cease nuclear energy generation altogether if a planned 2.3 billion euro annual tax on fuel rods is introduced . deputy finance minister werner gatzer has been conducting negotiations with the four providers to find an alternative to the tax , with the companies reportedly offering the government up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 38.3 billion -rrb- in exchange for permission to continue running nuclear plants for an additional 12 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble can be bought by energy companies german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble came out in favor of the proposed deal , as it would guarantee increased government revenue .
he was joined by chancellor angela merkel , who also praised the proposal . ' dirty business ' according to an agreement signed by the previous center-left german government , nuclear energy is supposed to be phased out in germany by 2020 .
merkel 's ruling center-right coalition wants to postpone this date , a position which the government opposition strongly opposes . frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , came out against the energy producers ' proposal while the greens ' renate kuenast told a regional daily that the proposal was " dirty business : billions for an -lsb- extended -rsb- run time , money for the comeback of a dangerous technology . " kuenast added that the opposition would not put up with the proposal and planned to make life difficult for ruling coalition come autumn . environment minister left out a spokesperson from germany 's environment ministry said that the environment minister norbert roettgen was not involved in the negotiations .
he said that the proposed fuel rod tax was a compromise aimed at encouraging the development of alternative energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister wants a tax on fuel rods before the electric companies proposed to buy their extended time , roettgen had advocated a much shorter extension of the time allowance coupled with heavy taxation , putting himself at odds with germany 's leading business associations . the president of the bda national employers ' association , dieter hundt , told the hamburger abendblatt he supported an unlimited extension of nuclear power plant lifetimes , declaring it " economically and environmentally irresponsible to shut down safe and profitable atomic power plants for ideological reasons . " hans peter keitel , president of the federal association of german industry , took a stronger position against roettgen 's proposals , saying the minister should realize he was " not the head of greenpeace . " merkel launches energy tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of germany wants nuclear power plants to be shuttered under the cloud of the stepped-up nuclear debates , merkel is expected to announce plans on monday to visit nuclear and other energy plants in preparation for her government 's much delayed energy plan aimed at solidifying laws governing germany 's energy sources . germany is split on the issue of nuclear energy , with just over half the population favoring the eventual shut-down of plants . author : david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : germans work to retain control of online personal information generational gap divides opinion on internet privacy merkel 's home to appear on google street view facebook , google use in germany stays high despite privacy inquiries google plans to launch street view in germany by end of year internet -pipe- 14.08.2010 german foreign minister joins criticism of google 's mapping program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have serious privacy concerns about street view german foreign minister guido westerwelle has added his voice to a growing chorus of opposition in the country to us internet giant google 's " street view " mapping service amid mounting concerns about online privacy . germany 's doubts about google 's mapping service " street view " have found a prominent voice in the current foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .

so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .

although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.08.2010 eu-somalia mission could undermine regional stability großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu-trained somali soldiers could defect to islamic militias somalia has drifted through 20 years of anarchy and war .
the international community has recommitted itself to establishing order there .
but an eu mission to train somali soldiers in uganda has come under scrutiny . in 1993 , the united states organized a peacekeeping mission under the auspices of the united nations to end a famine that gripped the horn of africa .
germany , in its first major military mission outside of europe since world war ii , sent 1,700 soldiers in support .
but as the humanitarian mission degenerated into a bloody counterinsurgency operation , the west retreated from a country that appeared to be permanently broken . today , the west has begun to hesitantly pick up where it left off in 1993 in a renewed bid to put somalia back together again .
after september 11 , the united states dispatched naval forces to the gulf of aden in order to prevent islamic terrorists from taking refuge in somalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already operates its own naval mission in the gulf of aden , operation atalanta the eu contributes to this effort through its own naval mission , operation atalanta .
in may , the eu began training 2,000 somali soldiers in neighboring uganda . " this mission is a clear sign of the solidarity of europe with somalia and the entire continent , " said german foreign minister guido westerwelle during a trip to the region last month .
" in the fight against terrorism and extremism , we have to stand together .
we will do what we can in order to stabilize somalia . " militant group gaining ground a fundamentalist islamic movement in somalia has the west worried .
in 2003 , a grassroots movement began to establish islamic-based courts in mogadishu in order to bring the city under control and stem rampant violence and criminality .
the effort began to yield results , and the courts banded together , creating a movement called the union of islamic courts -lrb- uic -rrb- . an internationally recognized interim government in the somali city of baidoa was helpless as the movement began to pick up steam , spreading its control throughout the country .
ethiopia , which has a long and complicated history with somalia , began to mobilize its military in an operation many believe was supported by the us .
the ethiopian army ultimately intervened during the winter of 2006 , sweeping the uic out of mogadishu and giving the interim government a tenuous seat of power in the war-scarred capital . with the broader islamic movement in disarray , an al qaeda-affiliated group called al-shabab emerged and began to put down roots in the southern region of somalia .
the us launched a series of airstrikes in order to disrupt the group as rumors circulated that foreign jihadists were entering the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia is seeing a growing islamic fundamentalist movement the african union subsequently deployed 5,000 peacekeepers to somalia in order to bring stability to the country and contain al-shabab .
but the peacekeeping force is understaffed and underequipped . the violence is spreading outside of somalia , as well .
al-shabab claimed responsibility for a suicide attack last month in uganda that killed at least 74 people as they watched the world cup final .
ugandan soldiers make up the bulk of the au peacekeeping troops . somalia also lies in a strategic region vital to international trade .
oil from the persian gulf is shipped through the gulf of aden on its way to the suez canal and ultimately western markets .
piracy has become a growing problem , with 116 successful or attempted hijackings of commercial ships in 2009 . eu mission could backfire in this context , the european union has an interest in establishing order in somalia .
some observers believe , however , that the mission to train somali soldiers will only fan the flames of instability and drive the horn of africa into a deeper circle of violence . " it 's a dirty civil war that 's being conducted there , with child soldiers and many civilian victims , with no consideration for the law of war , " said christoph marischka , who works for the militarization information center in the southern germany city of tuebingen .
" it 's a fatal undertaking to mobilize further soldiers there , whose concrete use we know nothing about . " the somali army is not known for its sparkling human rights record , either .
the ngo human rights watch has recorded many cases of transgression , such as an incident in which somali soldiers fired mortars at apartment buildings , breaking the law of war which requires militaries to distinguish between civilians and combatants .
the army also recruits child soldiers , according to a recent report submitted by un secretary general ban ki-moon . some policymakers are concerned that the eu training mission could undermine its own goals by unknowingly supporting the islamic militants it is designed to contain . " there is no functioning government in somalia , " said ana gomez , a portuguese representative in the eu parliament .
" that runs the risk that these people -lsb- somali soldiers -rsb- are trained and then support one of the islamic militias , al-shabab for example . " in the past , germany financed the training of somali police .
however , more than 1,000 of them recently disappeared under mysterious circumstances .
experts believe they are now rebels . author : daniel pelz / sk editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de hundreds of german-financed somali police officers go missing almost 1,000 somali police have gone missing after their training was financed by the german government .
it is feared these officers will now join forces with the islamist militants al-shabaab .

germany , in its first major military mission outside of europe since world war ii , sent 1,700 soldiers in support .
but as the humanitarian mission degenerated into a bloody counterinsurgency operation , the west retreated from a country that appeared to be permanently broken . today , the west has begun to hesitantly pick up where it left off in 1993 in a renewed bid to put somalia back together again .
after september 11 , the united states dispatched naval forces to the gulf of aden in order to prevent islamic terrorists from taking refuge in somalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already operates its own naval mission in the gulf of aden , operation atalanta the eu contributes to this effort through its own naval mission , operation atalanta .
in may , the eu began training 2,000 somali soldiers in neighboring uganda . " this mission is a clear sign of the solidarity of europe with somalia and the entire continent , " said german foreign minister guido westerwelle during a trip to the region last month .
" in the fight against terrorism and extremism , we have to stand together .
we will do what we can in order to stabilize somalia . " militant group gaining ground a fundamentalist islamic movement in somalia has the west worried .
in 2003 , a grassroots movement began to establish islamic-based courts in mogadishu in order to bring the city under control and stem rampant violence and criminality .
the effort began to yield results , and the courts banded together , creating a movement called the union of islamic courts -lrb- uic -rrb- . an internationally recognized interim government in the somali city of baidoa was helpless as the movement began to pick up steam , spreading its control throughout the country .
ethiopia , which has a long and complicated history with somalia , began to mobilize its military in an operation many believe was supported by the us .
the ethiopian army ultimately intervened during the winter of 2006 , sweeping the uic out of mogadishu and giving the interim government a tenuous seat of power in the war-scarred capital . with the broader islamic movement in disarray , an al qaeda-affiliated group called al-shabab emerged and began to put down roots in the southern region of somalia .
the us launched a series of airstrikes in order to disrupt the group as rumors circulated that foreign jihadists were entering the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia is seeing a growing islamic fundamentalist movement the african union subsequently deployed 5,000 peacekeepers to somalia in order to bring stability to the country and contain al-shabab .
but the peacekeeping force is understaffed and underequipped . the violence is spreading outside of somalia , as well .
al-shabab claimed responsibility for a suicide attack last month in uganda that killed at least 74 people as they watched the world cup final .
ugandan soldiers make up the bulk of the au peacekeeping troops . somalia also lies in a strategic region vital to international trade .
oil from the persian gulf is shipped through the gulf of aden on its way to the suez canal and ultimately western markets .
piracy has become a growing problem , with 116 successful or attempted hijackings of commercial ships in 2009 . eu mission could backfire in this context , the european union has an interest in establishing order in somalia .
some observers believe , however , that the mission to train somali soldiers will only fan the flames of instability and drive the horn of africa into a deeper circle of violence . " it 's a dirty civil war that 's being conducted there , with child soldiers and many civilian victims , with no consideration for the law of war , " said christoph marischka , who works for the militarization information center in the southern germany city of tuebingen .
" it 's a fatal undertaking to mobilize further soldiers there , whose concrete use we know nothing about . " the somali army is not known for its sparkling human rights record , either .
the ngo human rights watch has recorded many cases of transgression , such as an incident in which somali soldiers fired mortars at apartment buildings , breaking the law of war which requires militaries to distinguish between civilians and combatants .
the army also recruits child soldiers , according to a recent report submitted by un secretary general ban ki-moon . some policymakers are concerned that the eu training mission could undermine its own goals by unknowingly supporting the islamic militants it is designed to contain . " there is no functioning government in somalia , " said ana gomez , a portuguese representative in the eu parliament .
" that runs the risk that these people -lsb- somali soldiers -rsb- are trained and then support one of the islamic militias , al-shabab for example . " in the past , germany financed the training of somali police .
however , more than 1,000 of them recently disappeared under mysterious circumstances .
experts believe they are now rebels . author : daniel pelz / sk editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

the general debate over the future of german nuclear power has heated up again . controversial negotiations are underway in germany between the government and energy providers as companies threaten to shut down their nuclear power plants over a proposed tax on fuel rods and germany 's debate over its nuclear energy future reignites . news magazine der spiegel reported that the operators of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants - rwe , e.on , vattenfall and enbw - have said they will cease nuclear energy generation altogether if a planned 2.3 billion euro annual tax on fuel rods is introduced . deputy finance minister werner gatzer has been conducting negotiations with the four providers to find an alternative to the tax , with the companies reportedly offering the government up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 38.3 billion -rrb- in exchange for permission to continue running nuclear plants for an additional 12 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble can be bought by energy companies german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble came out in favor of the proposed deal , as it would guarantee increased government revenue .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

only artists who have been dead for over 70 years are allowed to be copied legally , so the brothers re-paint works of the most prominent european painters from before the turn of the 19th century . the brothers ' skills have impressed experts like christoph stoelzl , a german art critic and former museum director , who says their copies of impressionist ernst ludwig kirchner 's paintings could pass for originals . they have also received praise from customers , such as one-time modern art collector gerold schellstaeder , who has commissioned 145 posin paintings over the past 10 years and set up the world 's only posin brothers ' museum , located in northern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original or copy ?
" rubens , rembrandt , da vinci and other old masters - that 's the brothers ' specialty , " said schellstaeder .
" there are really no other artists that paint copies as well as they do . " harder than it seems replicating masterpieces is nothing new to the posin brothers , as this skill was part of their art education in russia .
their home country is known for its strong school of classical painting and drawing , and copying great art is practiced as an exercise to train both the eye and hand . however , according to schellstaeder , a perfect copy is more that just an exercise : it is a true work of art in and of itself . " it is more difficult to make a perfect copy of an already existing masterpiece than to paint a work of your own creation , " said schellstaeder .
" when the three posin brothers paint , they climb into the skin of the original artist .
if van gogh took five hours to paint a picture , so do they .
if rembrandt took four months , they do the same - and you see that in the painting afterwards . " artists at heart as far back as they can remember , the posins always preferred drawing and painting to soccer and other childhood pastimes .
they studied art at the leningrad arts academy , but their unwillingness to create pro-party , socialist art made their careers as freelance painters difficult . some of their exhibitions led to jail terms .
in 1984 , when the soviet authorities " suggested " they leave russia , they jumped at the opportunity and eventually settled in berlin . busily reproducing copies and painting creations of their own , they make no effort to promote themselves - but that has n't stopped art enthusiasts from all over the world from finding them nonetheless .
copying the works of the old masters at such a high level has been attempted many times before , but not with as much success as the posin brothers have had . result of good training according to michail posin , creating perfect copies of old masterpieces involves more than just going to museums and looking at the originals .
rather , it is about " capability and knowledge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers love to create their own art too " when someone orders a painting from , let 's say , rubens , we know his painting techniques , his painting style , his tempo , and temperament , " said michail posin .
" we do n't reproduce - we reconstruct an artwork . " " our art education was simply better than that of others , " added evgeni posin .
" here in germany the education is really bad , so we have no competitors .
i have only seen miserable attempts . " despite their success , the brothers remain modest about their copying talent .
in fact , they are more interested in creating their own art .
they dabble in a variety of styles and forms , utilize various techniques and have also created a few sculptures . the copying business , apart from generating profit , is a way of further developing the skills necessary to improve their own creations .
and they claim that their original works fetch higher prices than the copies anyway . author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

the general debate over the future of german nuclear power has heated up again . controversial negotiations are underway in germany between the government and energy providers as companies threaten to shut down their nuclear power plants over a proposed tax on fuel rods and germany 's debate over its nuclear energy future reignites . news magazine der spiegel reported that the operators of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants - rwe , e.on , vattenfall and enbw - have said they will cease nuclear energy generation altogether if a planned 2.3 billion euro annual tax on fuel rods is introduced . deputy finance minister werner gatzer has been conducting negotiations with the four providers to find an alternative to the tax , with the companies reportedly offering the government up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 38.3 billion -rrb- in exchange for permission to continue running nuclear plants for an additional 12 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble can be bought by energy companies german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble came out in favor of the proposed deal , as it would guarantee increased government revenue .
he was joined by chancellor angela merkel , who also praised the proposal . ' dirty business ' according to an agreement signed by the previous center-left german government , nuclear energy is supposed to be phased out in germany by 2020 .
merkel 's ruling center-right coalition wants to postpone this date , a position which the government opposition strongly opposes . frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , came out against the energy producers ' proposal while the greens ' renate kuenast told a regional daily that the proposal was " dirty business : billions for an -lsb- extended -rsb- run time , money for the comeback of a dangerous technology . " kuenast added that the opposition would not put up with the proposal and planned to make life difficult for ruling coalition come autumn . environment minister left out a spokesperson from germany 's environment ministry said that the environment minister norbert roettgen was not involved in the negotiations .
he said that the proposed fuel rod tax was a compromise aimed at encouraging the development of alternative energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister wants a tax on fuel rods before the electric companies proposed to buy their extended time , roettgen had advocated a much shorter extension of the time allowance coupled with heavy taxation , putting himself at odds with germany 's leading business associations . the president of the bda national employers ' association , dieter hundt , told the hamburger abendblatt he supported an unlimited extension of nuclear power plant lifetimes , declaring it " economically and environmentally irresponsible to shut down safe and profitable atomic power plants for ideological reasons . " hans peter keitel , president of the federal association of german industry , took a stronger position against roettgen 's proposals , saying the minister should realize he was " not the head of greenpeace . " merkel launches energy tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of germany wants nuclear power plants to be shuttered under the cloud of the stepped-up nuclear debates , merkel is expected to announce plans on monday to visit nuclear and other energy plants in preparation for her government 's much delayed energy plan aimed at solidifying laws governing germany 's energy sources . germany is split on the issue of nuclear energy , with just over half the population favoring the eventual shut-down of plants . author : david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the general debate over the future of german nuclear power has heated up again . controversial negotiations are underway in germany between the government and energy providers as companies threaten to shut down their nuclear power plants over a proposed tax on fuel rods and germany 's debate over its nuclear energy future reignites . news magazine der spiegel reported that the operators of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants - rwe , e.on , vattenfall and enbw - have said they will cease nuclear energy generation altogether if a planned 2.3 billion euro annual tax on fuel rods is introduced . deputy finance minister werner gatzer has been conducting negotiations with the four providers to find an alternative to the tax , with the companies reportedly offering the government up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 38.3 billion -rrb- in exchange for permission to continue running nuclear plants for an additional 12 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble can be bought by energy companies german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble came out in favor of the proposed deal , as it would guarantee increased government revenue .
he was joined by chancellor angela merkel , who also praised the proposal . ' dirty business ' according to an agreement signed by the previous center-left german government , nuclear energy is supposed to be phased out in germany by 2020 .
merkel 's ruling center-right coalition wants to postpone this date , a position which the government opposition strongly opposes . frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , came out against the energy producers ' proposal while the greens ' renate kuenast told a regional daily that the proposal was " dirty business : billions for an -lsb- extended -rsb- run time , money for the comeback of a dangerous technology . " kuenast added that the opposition would not put up with the proposal and planned to make life difficult for ruling coalition come autumn . environment minister left out a spokesperson from germany 's environment ministry said that the environment minister norbert roettgen was not involved in the negotiations .
he said that the proposed fuel rod tax was a compromise aimed at encouraging the development of alternative energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister wants a tax on fuel rods before the electric companies proposed to buy their extended time , roettgen had advocated a much shorter extension of the time allowance coupled with heavy taxation , putting himself at odds with germany 's leading business associations . the president of the bda national employers ' association , dieter hundt , told the hamburger abendblatt he supported an unlimited extension of nuclear power plant lifetimes , declaring it " economically and environmentally irresponsible to shut down safe and profitable atomic power plants for ideological reasons . " hans peter keitel , president of the federal association of german industry , took a stronger position against roettgen 's proposals , saying the minister should realize he was " not the head of greenpeace . " merkel launches energy tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of germany wants nuclear power plants to be shuttered under the cloud of the stepped-up nuclear debates , merkel is expected to announce plans on monday to visit nuclear and other energy plants in preparation for her government 's much delayed energy plan aimed at solidifying laws governing germany 's energy sources . germany is split on the issue of nuclear energy , with just over half the population favoring the eventual shut-down of plants . author : david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international community has recommitted itself to establishing order there .
but an eu mission to train somali soldiers in uganda has come under scrutiny . in 1993 , the united states organized a peacekeeping mission under the auspices of the united nations to end a famine that gripped the horn of africa .
germany , in its first major military mission outside of europe since world war ii , sent 1,700 soldiers in support .
but as the humanitarian mission degenerated into a bloody counterinsurgency operation , the west retreated from a country that appeared to be permanently broken . today , the west has begun to hesitantly pick up where it left off in 1993 in a renewed bid to put somalia back together again .
after september 11 , the united states dispatched naval forces to the gulf of aden in order to prevent islamic terrorists from taking refuge in somalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already operates its own naval mission in the gulf of aden , operation atalanta the eu contributes to this effort through its own naval mission , operation atalanta .

the international community has recommitted itself to establishing order there .
but an eu mission to train somali soldiers in uganda has come under scrutiny . in 1993 , the united states organized a peacekeeping mission under the auspices of the united nations to end a famine that gripped the horn of africa .
germany , in its first major military mission outside of europe since world war ii , sent 1,700 soldiers in support .
but as the humanitarian mission degenerated into a bloody counterinsurgency operation , the west retreated from a country that appeared to be permanently broken . today , the west has begun to hesitantly pick up where it left off in 1993 in a renewed bid to put somalia back together again .
after september 11 , the united states dispatched naval forces to the gulf of aden in order to prevent islamic terrorists from taking refuge in somalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already operates its own naval mission in the gulf of aden , operation atalanta the eu contributes to this effort through its own naval mission , operation atalanta .
in may , the eu began training 2,000 somali soldiers in neighboring uganda . " this mission is a clear sign of the solidarity of europe with somalia and the entire continent , " said german foreign minister guido westerwelle during a trip to the region last month .
" in the fight against terrorism and extremism , we have to stand together .
we will do what we can in order to stabilize somalia . " militant group gaining ground a fundamentalist islamic movement in somalia has the west worried .
in 2003 , a grassroots movement began to establish islamic-based courts in mogadishu in order to bring the city under control and stem rampant violence and criminality .
the effort began to yield results , and the courts banded together , creating a movement called the union of islamic courts -lrb- uic -rrb- . an internationally recognized interim government in the somali city of baidoa was helpless as the movement began to pick up steam , spreading its control throughout the country .
ethiopia , which has a long and complicated history with somalia , began to mobilize its military in an operation many believe was supported by the us .
the ethiopian army ultimately intervened during the winter of 2006 , sweeping the uic out of mogadishu and giving the interim government a tenuous seat of power in the war-scarred capital . with the broader islamic movement in disarray , an al qaeda-affiliated group called al-shabab emerged and began to put down roots in the southern region of somalia .

some observers believe , however , that the mission to train somali soldiers will only fan the flames of instability and drive the horn of africa into a deeper circle of violence . " it 's a dirty civil war that 's being conducted there , with child soldiers and many civilian victims , with no consideration for the law of war , " said christoph marischka , who works for the militarization information center in the southern germany city of tuebingen .
" it 's a fatal undertaking to mobilize further soldiers there , whose concrete use we know nothing about . " the somali army is not known for its sparkling human rights record , either .
the ngo human rights watch has recorded many cases of transgression , such as an incident in which somali soldiers fired mortars at apartment buildings , breaking the law of war which requires militaries to distinguish between civilians and combatants .
the army also recruits child soldiers , according to a recent report submitted by un secretary general ban ki-moon . some policymakers are concerned that the eu training mission could undermine its own goals by unknowingly supporting the islamic militants it is designed to contain .

only artists who have been dead for over 70 years are allowed to be copied legally , so the brothers re-paint works of the most prominent european painters from before the turn of the 19th century . the brothers ' skills have impressed experts like christoph stoelzl , a german art critic and former museum director , who says their copies of impressionist ernst ludwig kirchner 's paintings could pass for originals . they have also received praise from customers , such as one-time modern art collector gerold schellstaeder , who has commissioned 145 posin paintings over the past 10 years and set up the world 's only posin brothers ' museum , located in northern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original or copy ?

their home country is known for its strong school of classical painting and drawing , and copying great art is practiced as an exercise to train both the eye and hand . however , according to schellstaeder , a perfect copy is more that just an exercise : it is a true work of art in and of itself . " it is more difficult to make a perfect copy of an already existing masterpiece than to paint a work of your own creation , " said schellstaeder .

they studied art at the leningrad arts academy , but their unwillingness to create pro-party , socialist art made their careers as freelance painters difficult . some of their exhibitions led to jail terms .
in 1984 , when the soviet authorities " suggested " they leave russia , they jumped at the opportunity and eventually settled in berlin . busily reproducing copies and painting creations of their own , they make no effort to promote themselves - but that has n't stopped art enthusiasts from all over the world from finding them nonetheless .
copying the works of the old masters at such a high level has been attempted many times before , but not with as much success as the posin brothers have had . result of good training according to michail posin , creating perfect copies of old masterpieces involves more than just going to museums and looking at the originals .
rather , it is about " capability and knowledge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers love to create their own art too " when someone orders a painting from , let 's say , rubens , we know his painting techniques , his painting style , his tempo , and temperament , " said michail posin .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .

although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .

the general debate over the future of german nuclear power has heated up again . controversial negotiations are underway in germany between the government and energy providers as companies threaten to shut down their nuclear power plants over a proposed tax on fuel rods and germany 's debate over its nuclear energy future reignites . news magazine der spiegel reported that the operators of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants - rwe , e.on , vattenfall and enbw - have said they will cease nuclear energy generation altogether if a planned 2.3 billion euro annual tax on fuel rods is introduced . deputy finance minister werner gatzer has been conducting negotiations with the four providers to find an alternative to the tax , with the companies reportedly offering the government up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 38.3 billion -rrb- in exchange for permission to continue running nuclear plants for an additional 12 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble can be bought by energy companies german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble came out in favor of the proposed deal , as it would guarantee increased government revenue .
he was joined by chancellor angela merkel , who also praised the proposal . ' dirty business ' according to an agreement signed by the previous center-left german government , nuclear energy is supposed to be phased out in germany by 2020 .
merkel 's ruling center-right coalition wants to postpone this date , a position which the government opposition strongly opposes . frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , came out against the energy producers ' proposal while the greens ' renate kuenast told a regional daily that the proposal was " dirty business : billions for an -lsb- extended -rsb- run time , money for the comeback of a dangerous technology . " kuenast added that the opposition would not put up with the proposal and planned to make life difficult for ruling coalition come autumn . environment minister left out a spokesperson from germany 's environment ministry said that the environment minister norbert roettgen was not involved in the negotiations .
he said that the proposed fuel rod tax was a compromise aimed at encouraging the development of alternative energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister wants a tax on fuel rods before the electric companies proposed to buy their extended time , roettgen had advocated a much shorter extension of the time allowance coupled with heavy taxation , putting himself at odds with germany 's leading business associations . the president of the bda national employers ' association , dieter hundt , told the hamburger abendblatt he supported an unlimited extension of nuclear power plant lifetimes , declaring it " economically and environmentally irresponsible to shut down safe and profitable atomic power plants for ideological reasons . " hans peter keitel , president of the federal association of german industry , took a stronger position against roettgen 's proposals , saying the minister should realize he was " not the head of greenpeace . " merkel launches energy tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of germany wants nuclear power plants to be shuttered under the cloud of the stepped-up nuclear debates , merkel is expected to announce plans on monday to visit nuclear and other energy plants in preparation for her government 's much delayed energy plan aimed at solidifying laws governing germany 's energy sources . germany is split on the issue of nuclear energy , with just over half the population favoring the eventual shut-down of plants . author : david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the general debate over the future of german nuclear power has heated up again . controversial negotiations are underway in germany between the government and energy providers as companies threaten to shut down their nuclear power plants over a proposed tax on fuel rods and germany 's debate over its nuclear energy future reignites . news magazine der spiegel reported that the operators of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants - rwe , e.on , vattenfall and enbw - have said they will cease nuclear energy generation altogether if a planned 2.3 billion euro annual tax on fuel rods is introduced . deputy finance minister werner gatzer has been conducting negotiations with the four providers to find an alternative to the tax , with the companies reportedly offering the government up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 38.3 billion -rrb- in exchange for permission to continue running nuclear plants for an additional 12 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble can be bought by energy companies german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble came out in favor of the proposed deal , as it would guarantee increased government revenue .
he was joined by chancellor angela merkel , who also praised the proposal . ' dirty business ' according to an agreement signed by the previous center-left german government , nuclear energy is supposed to be phased out in germany by 2020 .
merkel 's ruling center-right coalition wants to postpone this date , a position which the government opposition strongly opposes . frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , came out against the energy producers ' proposal while the greens ' renate kuenast told a regional daily that the proposal was " dirty business : billions for an -lsb- extended -rsb- run time , money for the comeback of a dangerous technology . " kuenast added that the opposition would not put up with the proposal and planned to make life difficult for ruling coalition come autumn . environment minister left out a spokesperson from germany 's environment ministry said that the environment minister norbert roettgen was not involved in the negotiations .
he said that the proposed fuel rod tax was a compromise aimed at encouraging the development of alternative energy sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister wants a tax on fuel rods before the electric companies proposed to buy their extended time , roettgen had advocated a much shorter extension of the time allowance coupled with heavy taxation , putting himself at odds with germany 's leading business associations . the president of the bda national employers ' association , dieter hundt , told the hamburger abendblatt he supported an unlimited extension of nuclear power plant lifetimes , declaring it " economically and environmentally irresponsible to shut down safe and profitable atomic power plants for ideological reasons . " hans peter keitel , president of the federal association of german industry , took a stronger position against roettgen 's proposals , saying the minister should realize he was " not the head of greenpeace . " merkel launches energy tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of germany wants nuclear power plants to be shuttered under the cloud of the stepped-up nuclear debates , merkel is expected to announce plans on monday to visit nuclear and other energy plants in preparation for her government 's much delayed energy plan aimed at solidifying laws governing germany 's energy sources . germany is split on the issue of nuclear energy , with just over half the population favoring the eventual shut-down of plants . author : david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .

so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 14.08.2010 berlin artists create a buzz with " original fakes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have even copied the mona lisa three berlin-based russian artists have created waves in the art world with their works said to be astonishingly accurate replicas of famous paintings . posin art salon , a small gallery located in the berlin district of neukoelln , is the studio of evgeni , michail and semyon posin - three russian brothers who paint copies of iconic masterpieces . their works are so perfect that they 've sparked awe among art critics and museum directors . the " original fakes " are not cheap , each one selling for tens of thousands of euros .
only artists who have been dead for over 70 years are allowed to be copied legally , so the brothers re-paint works of the most prominent european painters from before the turn of the 19th century . the brothers ' skills have impressed experts like christoph stoelzl , a german art critic and former museum director , who says their copies of impressionist ernst ludwig kirchner 's paintings could pass for originals . they have also received praise from customers , such as one-time modern art collector gerold schellstaeder , who has commissioned 145 posin paintings over the past 10 years and set up the world 's only posin brothers ' museum , located in northern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original or copy ?
" rubens , rembrandt , da vinci and other old masters - that 's the brothers ' specialty , " said schellstaeder .
" there are really no other artists that paint copies as well as they do . " harder than it seems replicating masterpieces is nothing new to the posin brothers , as this skill was part of their art education in russia .
their home country is known for its strong school of classical painting and drawing , and copying great art is practiced as an exercise to train both the eye and hand . however , according to schellstaeder , a perfect copy is more that just an exercise : it is a true work of art in and of itself . " it is more difficult to make a perfect copy of an already existing masterpiece than to paint a work of your own creation , " said schellstaeder .
" when the three posin brothers paint , they climb into the skin of the original artist .
if van gogh took five hours to paint a picture , so do they .
if rembrandt took four months , they do the same - and you see that in the painting afterwards . " artists at heart as far back as they can remember , the posins always preferred drawing and painting to soccer and other childhood pastimes .
they studied art at the leningrad arts academy , but their unwillingness to create pro-party , socialist art made their careers as freelance painters difficult . some of their exhibitions led to jail terms .
in 1984 , when the soviet authorities " suggested " they leave russia , they jumped at the opportunity and eventually settled in berlin . busily reproducing copies and painting creations of their own , they make no effort to promote themselves - but that has n't stopped art enthusiasts from all over the world from finding them nonetheless .
copying the works of the old masters at such a high level has been attempted many times before , but not with as much success as the posin brothers have had . result of good training according to michail posin , creating perfect copies of old masterpieces involves more than just going to museums and looking at the originals .
rather , it is about " capability and knowledge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers love to create their own art too " when someone orders a painting from , let 's say , rubens , we know his painting techniques , his painting style , his tempo , and temperament , " said michail posin .
" we do n't reproduce - we reconstruct an artwork . " " our art education was simply better than that of others , " added evgeni posin .
" here in germany the education is really bad , so we have no competitors .
i have only seen miserable attempts . " despite their success , the brothers remain modest about their copying talent .
in fact , they are more interested in creating their own art .
they dabble in a variety of styles and forms , utilize various techniques and have also created a few sculptures . the copying business , apart from generating profit , is a way of further developing the skills necessary to improve their own creations .
and they claim that their original works fetch higher prices than the copies anyway . author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

ethiopia , which has a long and complicated history with somalia , began to mobilize its military in an operation many believe was supported by the us .
the ethiopian army ultimately intervened during the winter of 2006 , sweeping the uic out of mogadishu and giving the interim government a tenuous seat of power in the war-scarred capital . with the broader islamic movement in disarray , an al qaeda-affiliated group called al-shabab emerged and began to put down roots in the southern region of somalia .

the international community has recommitted itself to establishing order there .
but an eu mission to train somali soldiers in uganda has come under scrutiny . in 1993 , the united states organized a peacekeeping mission under the auspices of the united nations to end a famine that gripped the horn of africa .
germany , in its first major military mission outside of europe since world war ii , sent 1,700 soldiers in support .
but as the humanitarian mission degenerated into a bloody counterinsurgency operation , the west retreated from a country that appeared to be permanently broken . today , the west has begun to hesitantly pick up where it left off in 1993 in a renewed bid to put somalia back together again .
after september 11 , the united states dispatched naval forces to the gulf of aden in order to prevent islamic terrorists from taking refuge in somalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already operates its own naval mission in the gulf of aden , operation atalanta the eu contributes to this effort through its own naval mission , operation atalanta .
in may , the eu began training 2,000 somali soldiers in neighboring uganda . " this mission is a clear sign of the solidarity of europe with somalia and the entire continent , " said german foreign minister guido westerwelle during a trip to the region last month .
" in the fight against terrorism and extremism , we have to stand together .
we will do what we can in order to stabilize somalia . " militant group gaining ground a fundamentalist islamic movement in somalia has the west worried .
in 2003 , a grassroots movement began to establish islamic-based courts in mogadishu in order to bring the city under control and stem rampant violence and criminality .
the effort began to yield results , and the courts banded together , creating a movement called the union of islamic courts -lrb- uic -rrb- . an internationally recognized interim government in the somali city of baidoa was helpless as the movement began to pick up steam , spreading its control throughout the country .
ethiopia , which has a long and complicated history with somalia , began to mobilize its military in an operation many believe was supported by the us .
the ethiopian army ultimately intervened during the winter of 2006 , sweeping the uic out of mogadishu and giving the interim government a tenuous seat of power in the war-scarred capital . with the broader islamic movement in disarray , an al qaeda-affiliated group called al-shabab emerged and began to put down roots in the southern region of somalia .

" it 's a fatal undertaking to mobilize further soldiers there , whose concrete use we know nothing about . " the somali army is not known for its sparkling human rights record , either .
the ngo human rights watch has recorded many cases of transgression , such as an incident in which somali soldiers fired mortars at apartment buildings , breaking the law of war which requires militaries to distinguish between civilians and combatants .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle does n't want his home to be shown on the program last week it was announced that despite privacy concerns , street view would be available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
however , in a unique measure tailor-made for germany , people can opt to have their house or property made unrecognisable .
in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag , westerwelle , who is leader of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , said he would be adding his name to this list .
" for me it 's a question of principle , " he said .
" i will do all i can to prevent it . " 52 percent oppose street view westerwelle reportedly wants to use the google row to revive the traditional issue of civil rights within his party .
" the sensibility for the topic of protecting privacy is set to significantly rise in germany , " westerwelle said .
" the modern networked world and the private sphere which is worthy of protection should not be allowed to become enemies . " google 's street view , an online program allowing users to see panoramic , street-level images of cities around the world , has reignited a heated debate in germany about online privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the google cars have started photographing german cities german chancellor angela merkel 's centre-right coalition has stepped up pressure on google despite the company ’ s insistence that it would allow anyone to opt out of having their home shown on the program .
so far tens of thousands of germans have filed official objections to their homes and properties being included in the service .
according to the bild am sonntag , over half of the german population are n't in favor of their houses appearing on the service .
in a survey appearing in the newspaper , 52 percent said they did not want the exterior of their house to appear online , whereas 47 percent said they did not mind .
critics call for " better regulation " the launch of google street view in germany follows more than two years of negotiations and strong criticism from the government and citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far street view is only available in certain counties one of the sternest critics is johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
speaking to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , caspar said " the handling of this kind of data needs to be strongly regulated . "
although google has promised to protect people 's privacy , caspar remained sceptical .
he suggested reforming data protection laws so that strict penalties can be imposed on google if it " does not respect its commitments . "
many in the german government have already called for the creation of a special privacy law that would curtail google 's street view service .
but a spokeswoman for google , lena wagner , said on friday the company was n't in favor .
" we would be concerned about the wide-reaching implications of such a law that would hugely restrict the development of basic innovative and consumer-friendly mapping servicves - not just for google but for countless other companies , " wagner said .
google has already started rolling out its street view cars mounted with cameras to photograph the 20 cities that will appear online .
those who do not want their properties to appear online have until september 15 to object .

the general debate over the future of german nuclear power has heated up again . controversial negotiations are underway in germany between the government and energy providers as companies threaten to shut down their nuclear power plants over a proposed tax on fuel rods and germany 's debate over its nuclear energy future reignites . news magazine der spiegel reported that the operators of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants - rwe , e.on , vattenfall and enbw - have said they will cease nuclear energy generation altogether if a planned 2.3 billion euro annual tax on fuel rods is introduced . deputy finance minister werner gatzer has been conducting negotiations with the four providers to find an alternative to the tax , with the companies reportedly offering the government up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 38.3 billion -rrb- in exchange for permission to continue running nuclear plants for an additional 12 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble can be bought by energy companies german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble came out in favor of the proposed deal , as it would guarantee increased government revenue .

the move follows the release of 20 other prisoners last month . spain is to receive six more political dissidents from communist cuba after a similar release of 20 last month , the catholic archdiocese of havana said friday .
the move is the result of an agreement between the communist government and the roman catholic church .
officials said the six would be transferred directly from prison to a plane where they would be united with their families and flown to spain .
in may this year , cuban president raul castro held an unprecedented meeting with catholic cardinal jaime ortega .
following that meeting , castro agreed in june to free 52 of 75 dissidents who were imprisoned in a 2003 crackdown on government opponents .
the rest of the group had already been paroled when castro decided on the release .
the release of the prisoners has been welcomed by the international community .
cuba says release a " sovereign decision " church officials have emphasized that going into exile was only an option , not a condition for the prisoners ' release .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos met both castro and ortega in june , and has said cuba plans to eventually release all political prisoners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six released are part of a larger group of 52 but castro said in a speech to parliament earlier this month that the release of these prisoners was a sovereign decision , and that they were " counterrevolutionary prisoners , " " traitors , " and " mercenaries " working for the united states .
" none of these citizens were imprisoned for their ideas as depicted by the brutal campaigns to discredit cuba , " castro said .
the six comprise three journalists , a medical doctor , a poet and a man who briefly went on hunger strike .
according to the banned but tolerated cuban commission on human rights , the number of cuba 's political prisoners before the most recent releases had dropped by about 50 percent since raul castro replaced his ailing brother fidel castro in 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 14.08.2010 berlin artists create a buzz with " original fakes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have even copied the mona lisa three berlin-based russian artists have created waves in the art world with their works said to be astonishingly accurate replicas of famous paintings . posin art salon , a small gallery located in the berlin district of neukoelln , is the studio of evgeni , michail and semyon posin - three russian brothers who paint copies of iconic masterpieces . their works are so perfect that they 've sparked awe among art critics and museum directors . the " original fakes " are not cheap , each one selling for tens of thousands of euros .
only artists who have been dead for over 70 years are allowed to be copied legally , so the brothers re-paint works of the most prominent european painters from before the turn of the 19th century . the brothers ' skills have impressed experts like christoph stoelzl , a german art critic and former museum director , who says their copies of impressionist ernst ludwig kirchner 's paintings could pass for originals . they have also received praise from customers , such as one-time modern art collector gerold schellstaeder , who has commissioned 145 posin paintings over the past 10 years and set up the world 's only posin brothers ' museum , located in northern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original or copy ?
" rubens , rembrandt , da vinci and other old masters - that 's the brothers ' specialty , " said schellstaeder .
" there are really no other artists that paint copies as well as they do . " harder than it seems replicating masterpieces is nothing new to the posin brothers , as this skill was part of their art education in russia .
their home country is known for its strong school of classical painting and drawing , and copying great art is practiced as an exercise to train both the eye and hand . however , according to schellstaeder , a perfect copy is more that just an exercise : it is a true work of art in and of itself . " it is more difficult to make a perfect copy of an already existing masterpiece than to paint a work of your own creation , " said schellstaeder .
" when the three posin brothers paint , they climb into the skin of the original artist .
if van gogh took five hours to paint a picture , so do they .
if rembrandt took four months , they do the same - and you see that in the painting afterwards . " artists at heart as far back as they can remember , the posins always preferred drawing and painting to soccer and other childhood pastimes .
they studied art at the leningrad arts academy , but their unwillingness to create pro-party , socialist art made their careers as freelance painters difficult . some of their exhibitions led to jail terms .
in 1984 , when the soviet authorities " suggested " they leave russia , they jumped at the opportunity and eventually settled in berlin . busily reproducing copies and painting creations of their own , they make no effort to promote themselves - but that has n't stopped art enthusiasts from all over the world from finding them nonetheless .
copying the works of the old masters at such a high level has been attempted many times before , but not with as much success as the posin brothers have had . result of good training according to michail posin , creating perfect copies of old masterpieces involves more than just going to museums and looking at the originals .
rather , it is about " capability and knowledge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers love to create their own art too " when someone orders a painting from , let 's say , rubens , we know his painting techniques , his painting style , his tempo , and temperament , " said michail posin .
" we do n't reproduce - we reconstruct an artwork . " " our art education was simply better than that of others , " added evgeni posin .
" here in germany the education is really bad , so we have no competitors .
i have only seen miserable attempts . " despite their success , the brothers remain modest about their copying talent .
in fact , they are more interested in creating their own art .
they dabble in a variety of styles and forms , utilize various techniques and have also created a few sculptures . the copying business , apart from generating profit , is a way of further developing the skills necessary to improve their own creations .
and they claim that their original works fetch higher prices than the copies anyway . author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.08.2010 eu-somalia mission could undermine regional stability großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu-trained somali soldiers could defect to islamic militias somalia has drifted through 20 years of anarchy and war .
the international community has recommitted itself to establishing order there .
but an eu mission to train somali soldiers in uganda has come under scrutiny . in 1993 , the united states organized a peacekeeping mission under the auspices of the united nations to end a famine that gripped the horn of africa .
germany , in its first major military mission outside of europe since world war ii , sent 1,700 soldiers in support .
but as the humanitarian mission degenerated into a bloody counterinsurgency operation , the west retreated from a country that appeared to be permanently broken . today , the west has begun to hesitantly pick up where it left off in 1993 in a renewed bid to put somalia back together again .
after september 11 , the united states dispatched naval forces to the gulf of aden in order to prevent islamic terrorists from taking refuge in somalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already operates its own naval mission in the gulf of aden , operation atalanta the eu contributes to this effort through its own naval mission , operation atalanta .
in may , the eu began training 2,000 somali soldiers in neighboring uganda . " this mission is a clear sign of the solidarity of europe with somalia and the entire continent , " said german foreign minister guido westerwelle during a trip to the region last month .
" in the fight against terrorism and extremism , we have to stand together .
we will do what we can in order to stabilize somalia . " militant group gaining ground a fundamentalist islamic movement in somalia has the west worried .
in 2003 , a grassroots movement began to establish islamic-based courts in mogadishu in order to bring the city under control and stem rampant violence and criminality .
the effort began to yield results , and the courts banded together , creating a movement called the union of islamic courts -lrb- uic -rrb- . an internationally recognized interim government in the somali city of baidoa was helpless as the movement began to pick up steam , spreading its control throughout the country .
ethiopia , which has a long and complicated history with somalia , began to mobilize its military in an operation many believe was supported by the us .
the ethiopian army ultimately intervened during the winter of 2006 , sweeping the uic out of mogadishu and giving the interim government a tenuous seat of power in the war-scarred capital . with the broader islamic movement in disarray , an al qaeda-affiliated group called al-shabab emerged and began to put down roots in the southern region of somalia .
the us launched a series of airstrikes in order to disrupt the group as rumors circulated that foreign jihadists were entering the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia is seeing a growing islamic fundamentalist movement the african union subsequently deployed 5,000 peacekeepers to somalia in order to bring stability to the country and contain al-shabab .
but the peacekeeping force is understaffed and underequipped . the violence is spreading outside of somalia , as well .
al-shabab claimed responsibility for a suicide attack last month in uganda that killed at least 74 people as they watched the world cup final .
ugandan soldiers make up the bulk of the au peacekeeping troops . somalia also lies in a strategic region vital to international trade .
oil from the persian gulf is shipped through the gulf of aden on its way to the suez canal and ultimately western markets .
piracy has become a growing problem , with 116 successful or attempted hijackings of commercial ships in 2009 . eu mission could backfire in this context , the european union has an interest in establishing order in somalia .
some observers believe , however , that the mission to train somali soldiers will only fan the flames of instability and drive the horn of africa into a deeper circle of violence . " it 's a dirty civil war that 's being conducted there , with child soldiers and many civilian victims , with no consideration for the law of war , " said christoph marischka , who works for the militarization information center in the southern germany city of tuebingen .
" it 's a fatal undertaking to mobilize further soldiers there , whose concrete use we know nothing about . " the somali army is not known for its sparkling human rights record , either .
the ngo human rights watch has recorded many cases of transgression , such as an incident in which somali soldiers fired mortars at apartment buildings , breaking the law of war which requires militaries to distinguish between civilians and combatants .
the army also recruits child soldiers , according to a recent report submitted by un secretary general ban ki-moon . some policymakers are concerned that the eu training mission could undermine its own goals by unknowingly supporting the islamic militants it is designed to contain . " there is no functioning government in somalia , " said ana gomez , a portuguese representative in the eu parliament .
" that runs the risk that these people -lsb- somali soldiers -rsb- are trained and then support one of the islamic militias , al-shabab for example . " in the past , germany financed the training of somali police .
however , more than 1,000 of them recently disappeared under mysterious circumstances .
experts believe they are now rebels . author : daniel pelz / sk editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
