in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 14.01.2010 fighting acid attacks in pakistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims of acid attacks in pakistan many women living in pakistan , india and bangladesh have been the victims of acid attacks that have distorted their faces .
in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 14.01.2010 green week opens under cloud of price-war pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food trade needs a fairness overhaul , one critic says price pressure is a topic at this year 's green week food and agriculture trade fair , which opens friday in berlin .
germany producers are feeling the pinch , and a way out seems hard to find . even as the world 's largest fair for food , agriculture and horticulture was set to open , more fuel was being poured onto the already heated debate over food prices and quality .
this week , a number of food discounters in germany - led by market leader aldi - continued an ongoing price war with yet another round of cuts , this time on items ranging from vegetable oil to breakfast cereal to snack chips .
there were 12 such major price reductions over the course of 2009 .
speaking at the fair , german agriculture minister ilse aigner said she was " very concerned " about what she saw as " acrimonious competition " as the discounters vied for market share .
" if pricing sets the rule in our country , then at some point the quality will suffer , and in the end , so will the consumer , " she said .
" society must know the value of high-quality and safe foods . "
earlier in the week , food industry association bve sharply criticized the " ruinous competition " in food production , and called for it to stop immediately .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ilse aigner says quality counts according to bve , discount markets account for 44 percent of the food sold in germany .
the green week comprises 1600 exhibitors from 56 countries .
two-thirds of those exhibitors come from germany , and the issue of food prices is a serious one for the country 's food industry as a whole .
with penny-pinching customers flocking to the discounters , help for food producers may have to come from outside the german borders , if at all .
spending less , getting the same amount germans only spend 11 percent of their income on food , according to industry statistics , and producers are feeling the pinch .
revenue in 2009 fell four percent from the previous year , food industry spokesman juergen abraham told deutsche welle , despite the fact that unit sales remained constant . " consumers have n't eaten less , but the food industry has had to adjust to a reduction in revenue .
it 's dramatic for the 5,800 companies and 530,000 workers who have suffered from the situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi is leading the price wars it is n't only the food industry , agricultural producers are also groaning about the problem .
prices of milk , butter and meat are as low as ever in germany , meaning they have to depend on exports .
currently , about a fifth of all meat and dairy products as well as 12 percent of sweets and packaged baked goods made in germany are sold outside of the country .
yet export numbers have been falling as well , dropping 5 percent from 2008 to 2009 .
" the financial and economic crisis has hit exports hard , since in many importing countries the currencies have crashed , " said gerd sonnleitner , president of the german farmers ' union -lrb- dbv -rrb- .
" for us in the agricultural sector it is very important to get the world economy going again . "
world food trade due for a rehaul ?
agricultural products " made in germany " have a good reputation both inside and outside of the country , sonnleitner said , but they are n't in the top price segment .
some 80 percent of german agricultural exports go to eu countries , while in industrial food production that number reaches 84 percent .
outside the eu , russia , switzerland and the us are the key importers of german foodstuffs .
now germans are hoping to improve their market share in emerging and developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices are hovering at low levels but what may save the german food industry may also be the death of the food industries in developing markets . the sale of cheap agricultural products from industrial countries is harmful for them , according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur for the right to food .
the trade in food throughout the world , he said , needs fundamental change .
" we all know that the current trading system does n't work to the advantage -lsb- of people in developing countries -rsb- , " he told deutsche welle , explaining that it hurts producers in poor countries who do n't have access to highly developed markets .
it also distorts competition in their own countries , because industrialized nations can offer highly subsidized , and cheap , foods .
the issue of milk powder for example , imported milk powder in a developing market can be less expensive than local milk .
in bangladesh , farmers recently protested , demanding a stop to milk powder imports .
but the farming association head sonnleitner rejects those arguments , saying it is mostly problems such as civil war , corruption , and a lack of civil rights that distort the marketplaces there .
" i always find it unfair that we are accused of destroying these countries with agricultural exports .
small sums of money and small amounts of foods are blown up out of proportion , " he said .
and as long as the german market remains difficult for food producers , there will be a strong incentive to look abroad for solutions .

germany producers are feeling the pinch , and a way out seems hard to find . even as the world 's largest fair for food , agriculture and horticulture was set to open , more fuel was being poured onto the already heated debate over food prices and quality .
this week , a number of food discounters in germany - led by market leader aldi - continued an ongoing price war with yet another round of cuts , this time on items ranging from vegetable oil to breakfast cereal to snack chips .
there were 12 such major price reductions over the course of 2009 .
speaking at the fair , german agriculture minister ilse aigner said she was " very concerned " about what she saw as " acrimonious competition " as the discounters vied for market share .
" if pricing sets the rule in our country , then at some point the quality will suffer , and in the end , so will the consumer , " she said .
" society must know the value of high-quality and safe foods . "
earlier in the week , food industry association bve sharply criticized the " ruinous competition " in food production , and called for it to stop immediately .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ilse aigner says quality counts according to bve , discount markets account for 44 percent of the food sold in germany .
the green week comprises 1600 exhibitors from 56 countries .
two-thirds of those exhibitors come from germany , and the issue of food prices is a serious one for the country 's food industry as a whole .
with penny-pinching customers flocking to the discounters , help for food producers may have to come from outside the german borders , if at all .
spending less , getting the same amount germans only spend 11 percent of their income on food , according to industry statistics , and producers are feeling the pinch .
revenue in 2009 fell four percent from the previous year , food industry spokesman juergen abraham told deutsche welle , despite the fact that unit sales remained constant . " consumers have n't eaten less , but the food industry has had to adjust to a reduction in revenue .
it 's dramatic for the 5,800 companies and 530,000 workers who have suffered from the situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi is leading the price wars it is n't only the food industry , agricultural producers are also groaning about the problem .
prices of milk , butter and meat are as low as ever in germany , meaning they have to depend on exports .
currently , about a fifth of all meat and dairy products as well as 12 percent of sweets and packaged baked goods made in germany are sold outside of the country .
yet export numbers have been falling as well , dropping 5 percent from 2008 to 2009 .
" the financial and economic crisis has hit exports hard , since in many importing countries the currencies have crashed , " said gerd sonnleitner , president of the german farmers ' union -lrb- dbv -rrb- .
" for us in the agricultural sector it is very important to get the world economy going again . "
world food trade due for a rehaul ?
agricultural products " made in germany " have a good reputation both inside and outside of the country , sonnleitner said , but they are n't in the top price segment .
some 80 percent of german agricultural exports go to eu countries , while in industrial food production that number reaches 84 percent .
outside the eu , russia , switzerland and the us are the key importers of german foodstuffs .
now germans are hoping to improve their market share in emerging and developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices are hovering at low levels but what may save the german food industry may also be the death of the food industries in developing markets . the sale of cheap agricultural products from industrial countries is harmful for them , according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur for the right to food .
the trade in food throughout the world , he said , needs fundamental change .
" we all know that the current trading system does n't work to the advantage -lsb- of people in developing countries -rsb- , " he told deutsche welle , explaining that it hurts producers in poor countries who do n't have access to highly developed markets .
it also distorts competition in their own countries , because industrialized nations can offer highly subsidized , and cheap , foods .
the issue of milk powder for example , imported milk powder in a developing market can be less expensive than local milk .
in bangladesh , farmers recently protested , demanding a stop to milk powder imports .
but the farming association head sonnleitner rejects those arguments , saying it is mostly problems such as civil war , corruption , and a lack of civil rights that distort the marketplaces there .
" i always find it unfair that we are accused of destroying these countries with agricultural exports .
small sums of money and small amounts of foods are blown up out of proportion , " he said .
and as long as the german market remains difficult for food producers , there will be a strong incentive to look abroad for solutions .

karim popal , an afghan-born german lawyer based in bremen who represents some of the afghans who lost family members in the attack , said he has reached a general agreement with the defense ministry on the compensation .
immediate compensation will aim to help the families through the winter and will include food , clothing , blankets and fuel , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popal has been criticized for his handling of the case while details and costs of long-term compensation projects have not yet been negotiated , popal said he imagined they would include the establishment of an orphanage , an agricultural cooperative and a carpet weaving facility .
attack surrounded with controversy popal also assured reporters all of his 79 clients are supportive of the idea .
he has rejected claims by some critics that some of his clients have dropped out of the group he represents .
he has also been accused of exaggerating the number of civilian casualties in the attack , which took place on september 4 in the northern city of kunduz and has caused major controversy in germany .
according to popal , a team of six lawyers traveled to afghanistan to interview survivors of the attack and gather information on the victims .
he says he has exact documentation of at least 113 deaths , but that the complete number is likely 137 civilians .
not included in that number are 20 injured and 22 missing , bringing the number of civilian casualities to 179 , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 14.01.2010 piracy on the high seas hits peak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates raised their game in 2009 a new report by the international maritime bureau has revealed that piracy rose to its highest level in six years in 2009 , but the eu anti-piracy operation atalanta prevented the rate from rising even further . pirate attacks around the world have more than tripled in 2009 according to the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- .
in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .
" all three work in coordination with each other , sharing information and resources , and i think all three work together equally , " mukundan said .
in the gulf of aden , 116 successful or attempted attacks took place , compared with 92 in 2008 .
large carriers were targeted most often .
" as of december 31 , suspected somali pirates were holding 12 vessels for ransom with 263 crew-members of various nationalities as hostages , " the imb report said .
not just somalis the report also pointed to a rise in the number of attacks in other areas , especially the south china seas , where there was the largest number of hijackings for five years .
on top of this , piracy around south america more than doubled in 2009 .
but attacks in the malacca strait , which was a world piracy hotspot just a few years ago , remained at just two in 2009 , the same as the previous year , the imb said. bk / afp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .
" all three work in coordination with each other , sharing information and resources , and i think all three work together equally , " mukundan said .
in the gulf of aden , 116 successful or attempted attacks took place , compared with 92 in 2008 .
large carriers were targeted most often .
" as of december 31 , suspected somali pirates were holding 12 vessels for ransom with 263 crew-members of various nationalities as hostages , " the imb report said .
not just somalis the report also pointed to a rise in the number of attacks in other areas , especially the south china seas , where there was the largest number of hijackings for five years .
on top of this , piracy around south america more than doubled in 2009 .
but attacks in the malacca strait , which was a world piracy hotspot just a few years ago , remained at just two in 2009 , the same as the previous year , the imb said. bk / afp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .

" life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .
you can hear all that in his music , " said strugala . the asian connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang lang says chopin 's music works well with animation a year-long season commemorating the 200th anniversary of chopin 's birth was officially launched earlier this month with a gala concert at the warsaw philharmonic featuring 27-year-old chinese pianist lang lang .
according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .
" one of the features will be an outside mural , a street art activity , in which a huge space will be created where we want to support all sorts of creativity by young people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .
a festival called " chopin and his europe " will be held in august and the three-week international piano chopin competition - where 100 pianists perform only works by chopin - takes place in october . chopin in 3d in one of poland 's leading film studios in the city of lodz , an international crew is busy shooting a 3d co-production set to chopin 's music .
" the flying machine " is being made by the uk 's breahthru films , the makers of academy award-winning " peter and the wolf , " and poland 's se-ma-for studio . the music in the film is played by lang lang , who finds the combination of a cartoon with chopin 's piano harmonies very appropriate . " i started watching ' tom and jerry ' to get into classical music and to get into piano playing , " he said , tongue-in-cheek .
" cartoon , animation and music is always connected so closely , you can not find a better context to put music and animation together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.01.2010 as bundesliga re-starts , tussles at top and bottom mean plenty of drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders leverkusen are being hunted by a closing pack german soccer 's winter break is over - hostilities resumed last weekend .
with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .

however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .

the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .

with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .

cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .

" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .

" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .
you can hear all that in his music , " said strugala . the asian connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang lang says chopin 's music works well with animation a year-long season commemorating the 200th anniversary of chopin 's birth was officially launched earlier this month with a gala concert at the warsaw philharmonic featuring 27-year-old chinese pianist lang lang .
according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .
" one of the features will be an outside mural , a street art activity , in which a huge space will be created where we want to support all sorts of creativity by young people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .
a festival called " chopin and his europe " will be held in august and the three-week international piano chopin competition - where 100 pianists perform only works by chopin - takes place in october . chopin in 3d in one of poland 's leading film studios in the city of lodz , an international crew is busy shooting a 3d co-production set to chopin 's music .

" i started watching ' tom and jerry ' to get into classical music and to get into piano playing , " he said , tongue-in-cheek .
" cartoon , animation and music is always connected so closely , you can not find a better context to put music and animation together .

eu ministers are meeting informally in spain to discuss what european energy policy will be like in the future .
a mix of sustainable energy sources and infrastructure connecting countries could reduce emissions . nearly a month after the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , european union ministers are meeting in seville to discuss the future of energy in europe .
an informal council meeting will focus on the european strategic energy technology plan and the european energy action plan for 2010-2014 , which addresses environmental sustainability along with the security of european energy supplies .
the meeting will continue through sunday and coincides with an informal meeting of the european ministers of energy and environment , to be held friday and saturday , also in seville .
antonio hernandez garcia , director general for energy policy and mines at the spanish ministry of industry , said : ' energy policy can not be conceived without sustainability . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts about energy sources such as natural gas could be avoided .
hernandez garcia stated spain will work to diversify european energy sources and develop infrastructure connecting countries during the term of its european union presidency .
doing so may help avoid conflicts similar to those over gas , which have occurred between russia and the ukraine .
alternative energies analyzed by the european strategic energy technology plan include : solar , thermal-solar and photovoltaic and wind power on land and sea .
rainer hinrichs-rahlwes , vice president of the european renewable energies federation , said despite the copenhagen conference results ministers would do well to work on an agreement increasing the planned cut in european emissions from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
' it would certainly be sensible to reach an agreement within the european union very early on , ' he said . ' it must be made clear that we need to continue with higher goals than planned .
these goals can be reached with renewable energy sources . '

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .

" life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .

" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .

vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 14.01.2010 piracy on the high seas hits peak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates raised their game in 2009 a new report by the international maritime bureau has revealed that piracy rose to its highest level in six years in 2009 , but the eu anti-piracy operation atalanta prevented the rate from rising even further . pirate attacks around the world have more than tripled in 2009 according to the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- .
in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .
" all three work in coordination with each other , sharing information and resources , and i think all three work together equally , " mukundan said .
in the gulf of aden , 116 successful or attempted attacks took place , compared with 92 in 2008 .
large carriers were targeted most often .
" as of december 31 , suspected somali pirates were holding 12 vessels for ransom with 263 crew-members of various nationalities as hostages , " the imb report said .
not just somalis the report also pointed to a rise in the number of attacks in other areas , especially the south china seas , where there was the largest number of hijackings for five years .
on top of this , piracy around south america more than doubled in 2009 .
but attacks in the malacca strait , which was a world piracy hotspot just a few years ago , remained at just two in 2009 , the same as the previous year , the imb said. bk / afp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karim popal , an afghan-born german lawyer based in bremen who represents some of the afghans who lost family members in the attack , said he has reached a general agreement with the defense ministry on the compensation .
immediate compensation will aim to help the families through the winter and will include food , clothing , blankets and fuel , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popal has been criticized for his handling of the case while details and costs of long-term compensation projects have not yet been negotiated , popal said he imagined they would include the establishment of an orphanage , an agricultural cooperative and a carpet weaving facility .
attack surrounded with controversy popal also assured reporters all of his 79 clients are supportive of the idea .
he has rejected claims by some critics that some of his clients have dropped out of the group he represents .
he has also been accused of exaggerating the number of civilian casualties in the attack , which took place on september 4 in the northern city of kunduz and has caused major controversy in germany .
according to popal , a team of six lawyers traveled to afghanistan to interview survivors of the attack and gather information on the victims .
he says he has exact documentation of at least 113 deaths , but that the complete number is likely 137 civilians .
not included in that number are 20 injured and 22 missing , bringing the number of civilian casualities to 179 , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.01.2010 eu official calls cyber attacks on chinese political activists " worrying " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans of google are begging it to stay amid threats of a pullout google has been praised for refusing to keep facilitating censorship of its chinese services .
but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 14.01.2010 fighting acid attacks in pakistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims of acid attacks in pakistan many women living in pakistan , india and bangladesh have been the victims of acid attacks that have distorted their faces .
in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .

germany producers are feeling the pinch , and a way out seems hard to find . even as the world 's largest fair for food , agriculture and horticulture was set to open , more fuel was being poured onto the already heated debate over food prices and quality .
this week , a number of food discounters in germany - led by market leader aldi - continued an ongoing price war with yet another round of cuts , this time on items ranging from vegetable oil to breakfast cereal to snack chips .
there were 12 such major price reductions over the course of 2009 .
speaking at the fair , german agriculture minister ilse aigner said she was " very concerned " about what she saw as " acrimonious competition " as the discounters vied for market share .
" if pricing sets the rule in our country , then at some point the quality will suffer , and in the end , so will the consumer , " she said .
" society must know the value of high-quality and safe foods . "
earlier in the week , food industry association bve sharply criticized the " ruinous competition " in food production , and called for it to stop immediately .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ilse aigner says quality counts according to bve , discount markets account for 44 percent of the food sold in germany .
the green week comprises 1600 exhibitors from 56 countries .
two-thirds of those exhibitors come from germany , and the issue of food prices is a serious one for the country 's food industry as a whole .
with penny-pinching customers flocking to the discounters , help for food producers may have to come from outside the german borders , if at all .
spending less , getting the same amount germans only spend 11 percent of their income on food , according to industry statistics , and producers are feeling the pinch .
revenue in 2009 fell four percent from the previous year , food industry spokesman juergen abraham told deutsche welle , despite the fact that unit sales remained constant . " consumers have n't eaten less , but the food industry has had to adjust to a reduction in revenue .
it 's dramatic for the 5,800 companies and 530,000 workers who have suffered from the situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi is leading the price wars it is n't only the food industry , agricultural producers are also groaning about the problem .
prices of milk , butter and meat are as low as ever in germany , meaning they have to depend on exports .
currently , about a fifth of all meat and dairy products as well as 12 percent of sweets and packaged baked goods made in germany are sold outside of the country .
yet export numbers have been falling as well , dropping 5 percent from 2008 to 2009 .
" the financial and economic crisis has hit exports hard , since in many importing countries the currencies have crashed , " said gerd sonnleitner , president of the german farmers ' union -lrb- dbv -rrb- .
" for us in the agricultural sector it is very important to get the world economy going again . "
world food trade due for a rehaul ?
agricultural products " made in germany " have a good reputation both inside and outside of the country , sonnleitner said , but they are n't in the top price segment .
some 80 percent of german agricultural exports go to eu countries , while in industrial food production that number reaches 84 percent .
outside the eu , russia , switzerland and the us are the key importers of german foodstuffs .
now germans are hoping to improve their market share in emerging and developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices are hovering at low levels but what may save the german food industry may also be the death of the food industries in developing markets . the sale of cheap agricultural products from industrial countries is harmful for them , according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur for the right to food .
the trade in food throughout the world , he said , needs fundamental change .
" we all know that the current trading system does n't work to the advantage -lsb- of people in developing countries -rsb- , " he told deutsche welle , explaining that it hurts producers in poor countries who do n't have access to highly developed markets .
it also distorts competition in their own countries , because industrialized nations can offer highly subsidized , and cheap , foods .
the issue of milk powder for example , imported milk powder in a developing market can be less expensive than local milk .
in bangladesh , farmers recently protested , demanding a stop to milk powder imports .
but the farming association head sonnleitner rejects those arguments , saying it is mostly problems such as civil war , corruption , and a lack of civil rights that distort the marketplaces there .
" i always find it unfair that we are accused of destroying these countries with agricultural exports .
small sums of money and small amounts of foods are blown up out of proportion , " he said .
and as long as the german market remains difficult for food producers , there will be a strong incentive to look abroad for solutions .

now germans are hoping to improve their market share in emerging and developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices are hovering at low levels but what may save the german food industry may also be the death of the food industries in developing markets . the sale of cheap agricultural products from industrial countries is harmful for them , according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur for the right to food .
the trade in food throughout the world , he said , needs fundamental change .
" we all know that the current trading system does n't work to the advantage -lsb- of people in developing countries -rsb- , " he told deutsche welle , explaining that it hurts producers in poor countries who do n't have access to highly developed markets .
it also distorts competition in their own countries , because industrialized nations can offer highly subsidized , and cheap , foods .
the issue of milk powder for example , imported milk powder in a developing market can be less expensive than local milk .
in bangladesh , farmers recently protested , demanding a stop to milk powder imports .
but the farming association head sonnleitner rejects those arguments , saying it is mostly problems such as civil war , corruption , and a lack of civil rights that distort the marketplaces there .
" i always find it unfair that we are accused of destroying these countries with agricultural exports .
small sums of money and small amounts of foods are blown up out of proportion , " he said .
and as long as the german market remains difficult for food producers , there will be a strong incentive to look abroad for solutions .

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.01.2010 eu official calls cyber attacks on chinese political activists " worrying " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans of google are begging it to stay amid threats of a pullout google has been praised for refusing to keep facilitating censorship of its chinese services .
but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .

more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .
" all three work in coordination with each other , sharing information and resources , and i think all three work together equally , " mukundan said .
in the gulf of aden , 116 successful or attempted attacks took place , compared with 92 in 2008 .
large carriers were targeted most often .
" as of december 31 , suspected somali pirates were holding 12 vessels for ransom with 263 crew-members of various nationalities as hostages , " the imb report said .
not just somalis the report also pointed to a rise in the number of attacks in other areas , especially the south china seas , where there was the largest number of hijackings for five years .
on top of this , piracy around south america more than doubled in 2009 .
but attacks in the malacca strait , which was a world piracy hotspot just a few years ago , remained at just two in 2009 , the same as the previous year , the imb said. bk / afp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.01.2010 as bundesliga re-starts , tussles at top and bottom mean plenty of drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders leverkusen are being hunted by a closing pack german soccer 's winter break is over - hostilities resumed last weekend .
with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.01.2010 as bundesliga re-starts , tussles at top and bottom mean plenty of drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders leverkusen are being hunted by a closing pack german soccer 's winter break is over - hostilities resumed last weekend .
with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 14.01.2010 fighting acid attacks in pakistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims of acid attacks in pakistan many women living in pakistan , india and bangladesh have been the victims of acid attacks that have distorted their faces .
in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .

eu ministers are meeting informally in spain to discuss what european energy policy will be like in the future .
a mix of sustainable energy sources and infrastructure connecting countries could reduce emissions . nearly a month after the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , european union ministers are meeting in seville to discuss the future of energy in europe .
an informal council meeting will focus on the european strategic energy technology plan and the european energy action plan for 2010-2014 , which addresses environmental sustainability along with the security of european energy supplies .
the meeting will continue through sunday and coincides with an informal meeting of the european ministers of energy and environment , to be held friday and saturday , also in seville .
antonio hernandez garcia , director general for energy policy and mines at the spanish ministry of industry , said : ' energy policy can not be conceived without sustainability . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts about energy sources such as natural gas could be avoided .
hernandez garcia stated spain will work to diversify european energy sources and develop infrastructure connecting countries during the term of its european union presidency .
doing so may help avoid conflicts similar to those over gas , which have occurred between russia and the ukraine .
alternative energies analyzed by the european strategic energy technology plan include : solar , thermal-solar and photovoltaic and wind power on land and sea .
rainer hinrichs-rahlwes , vice president of the european renewable energies federation , said despite the copenhagen conference results ministers would do well to work on an agreement increasing the planned cut in european emissions from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
' it would certainly be sensible to reach an agreement within the european union very early on , ' he said . ' it must be made clear that we need to continue with higher goals than planned .
these goals can be reached with renewable energy sources . '

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 14.01.2010 even before deadly quake , haiti 's situation was dire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lives of many in haiti have been difficult for decades or longer at its founding haiti was a beacon of freedom , now it is the poorhouse of the western hemisphere .
even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

karim popal , an afghan-born german lawyer based in bremen who represents some of the afghans who lost family members in the attack , said he has reached a general agreement with the defense ministry on the compensation .
immediate compensation will aim to help the families through the winter and will include food , clothing , blankets and fuel , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popal has been criticized for his handling of the case while details and costs of long-term compensation projects have not yet been negotiated , popal said he imagined they would include the establishment of an orphanage , an agricultural cooperative and a carpet weaving facility .
attack surrounded with controversy popal also assured reporters all of his 79 clients are supportive of the idea .
he has rejected claims by some critics that some of his clients have dropped out of the group he represents .
he has also been accused of exaggerating the number of civilian casualties in the attack , which took place on september 4 in the northern city of kunduz and has caused major controversy in germany .
according to popal , a team of six lawyers traveled to afghanistan to interview survivors of the attack and gather information on the victims .
he says he has exact documentation of at least 113 deaths , but that the complete number is likely 137 civilians .
not included in that number are 20 injured and 22 missing , bringing the number of civilian casualities to 179 , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.01.2010 as bundesliga re-starts , tussles at top and bottom mean plenty of drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders leverkusen are being hunted by a closing pack german soccer 's winter break is over - hostilities resumed last weekend .
with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.01.2010 as bundesliga re-starts , tussles at top and bottom mean plenty of drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders leverkusen are being hunted by a closing pack german soccer 's winter break is over - hostilities resumed last weekend .
with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

eu ministers are meeting informally in spain to discuss what european energy policy will be like in the future .
a mix of sustainable energy sources and infrastructure connecting countries could reduce emissions . nearly a month after the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , european union ministers are meeting in seville to discuss the future of energy in europe .
an informal council meeting will focus on the european strategic energy technology plan and the european energy action plan for 2010-2014 , which addresses environmental sustainability along with the security of european energy supplies .
the meeting will continue through sunday and coincides with an informal meeting of the european ministers of energy and environment , to be held friday and saturday , also in seville .
antonio hernandez garcia , director general for energy policy and mines at the spanish ministry of industry , said : ' energy policy can not be conceived without sustainability . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts about energy sources such as natural gas could be avoided .
hernandez garcia stated spain will work to diversify european energy sources and develop infrastructure connecting countries during the term of its european union presidency .
doing so may help avoid conflicts similar to those over gas , which have occurred between russia and the ukraine .
alternative energies analyzed by the european strategic energy technology plan include : solar , thermal-solar and photovoltaic and wind power on land and sea .
rainer hinrichs-rahlwes , vice president of the european renewable energies federation , said despite the copenhagen conference results ministers would do well to work on an agreement increasing the planned cut in european emissions from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
' it would certainly be sensible to reach an agreement within the european union very early on , ' he said . ' it must be made clear that we need to continue with higher goals than planned .
these goals can be reached with renewable energy sources . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.01.2010 eu official calls cyber attacks on chinese political activists " worrying " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans of google are begging it to stay amid threats of a pullout google has been praised for refusing to keep facilitating censorship of its chinese services .
but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany producers are feeling the pinch , and a way out seems hard to find . even as the world 's largest fair for food , agriculture and horticulture was set to open , more fuel was being poured onto the already heated debate over food prices and quality .
this week , a number of food discounters in germany - led by market leader aldi - continued an ongoing price war with yet another round of cuts , this time on items ranging from vegetable oil to breakfast cereal to snack chips .
there were 12 such major price reductions over the course of 2009 .
speaking at the fair , german agriculture minister ilse aigner said she was " very concerned " about what she saw as " acrimonious competition " as the discounters vied for market share .
" if pricing sets the rule in our country , then at some point the quality will suffer , and in the end , so will the consumer , " she said .
" society must know the value of high-quality and safe foods . "
earlier in the week , food industry association bve sharply criticized the " ruinous competition " in food production , and called for it to stop immediately .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ilse aigner says quality counts according to bve , discount markets account for 44 percent of the food sold in germany .
the green week comprises 1600 exhibitors from 56 countries .
two-thirds of those exhibitors come from germany , and the issue of food prices is a serious one for the country 's food industry as a whole .
with penny-pinching customers flocking to the discounters , help for food producers may have to come from outside the german borders , if at all .
spending less , getting the same amount germans only spend 11 percent of their income on food , according to industry statistics , and producers are feeling the pinch .
revenue in 2009 fell four percent from the previous year , food industry spokesman juergen abraham told deutsche welle , despite the fact that unit sales remained constant . " consumers have n't eaten less , but the food industry has had to adjust to a reduction in revenue .
it 's dramatic for the 5,800 companies and 530,000 workers who have suffered from the situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi is leading the price wars it is n't only the food industry , agricultural producers are also groaning about the problem .
prices of milk , butter and meat are as low as ever in germany , meaning they have to depend on exports .
currently , about a fifth of all meat and dairy products as well as 12 percent of sweets and packaged baked goods made in germany are sold outside of the country .
yet export numbers have been falling as well , dropping 5 percent from 2008 to 2009 .
" the financial and economic crisis has hit exports hard , since in many importing countries the currencies have crashed , " said gerd sonnleitner , president of the german farmers ' union -lrb- dbv -rrb- .
" for us in the agricultural sector it is very important to get the world economy going again . "
world food trade due for a rehaul ?
agricultural products " made in germany " have a good reputation both inside and outside of the country , sonnleitner said , but they are n't in the top price segment .
some 80 percent of german agricultural exports go to eu countries , while in industrial food production that number reaches 84 percent .
outside the eu , russia , switzerland and the us are the key importers of german foodstuffs .
now germans are hoping to improve their market share in emerging and developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices are hovering at low levels but what may save the german food industry may also be the death of the food industries in developing markets . the sale of cheap agricultural products from industrial countries is harmful for them , according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur for the right to food .
the trade in food throughout the world , he said , needs fundamental change .
" we all know that the current trading system does n't work to the advantage -lsb- of people in developing countries -rsb- , " he told deutsche welle , explaining that it hurts producers in poor countries who do n't have access to highly developed markets .
it also distorts competition in their own countries , because industrialized nations can offer highly subsidized , and cheap , foods .
the issue of milk powder for example , imported milk powder in a developing market can be less expensive than local milk .
in bangladesh , farmers recently protested , demanding a stop to milk powder imports .
but the farming association head sonnleitner rejects those arguments , saying it is mostly problems such as civil war , corruption , and a lack of civil rights that distort the marketplaces there .
" i always find it unfair that we are accused of destroying these countries with agricultural exports .
small sums of money and small amounts of foods are blown up out of proportion , " he said .
and as long as the german market remains difficult for food producers , there will be a strong incentive to look abroad for solutions .

eu ministers are meeting informally in spain to discuss what european energy policy will be like in the future .
a mix of sustainable energy sources and infrastructure connecting countries could reduce emissions . nearly a month after the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , european union ministers are meeting in seville to discuss the future of energy in europe .
an informal council meeting will focus on the european strategic energy technology plan and the european energy action plan for 2010-2014 , which addresses environmental sustainability along with the security of european energy supplies .
the meeting will continue through sunday and coincides with an informal meeting of the european ministers of energy and environment , to be held friday and saturday , also in seville .
antonio hernandez garcia , director general for energy policy and mines at the spanish ministry of industry , said : ' energy policy can not be conceived without sustainability . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts about energy sources such as natural gas could be avoided .
hernandez garcia stated spain will work to diversify european energy sources and develop infrastructure connecting countries during the term of its european union presidency .
doing so may help avoid conflicts similar to those over gas , which have occurred between russia and the ukraine .
alternative energies analyzed by the european strategic energy technology plan include : solar , thermal-solar and photovoltaic and wind power on land and sea .
rainer hinrichs-rahlwes , vice president of the european renewable energies federation , said despite the copenhagen conference results ministers would do well to work on an agreement increasing the planned cut in european emissions from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
' it would certainly be sensible to reach an agreement within the european union very early on , ' he said . ' it must be made clear that we need to continue with higher goals than planned .
these goals can be reached with renewable energy sources . '

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .
you can hear all that in his music , " said strugala . the asian connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang lang says chopin 's music works well with animation a year-long season commemorating the 200th anniversary of chopin 's birth was officially launched earlier this month with a gala concert at the warsaw philharmonic featuring 27-year-old chinese pianist lang lang .
according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .
" one of the features will be an outside mural , a street art activity , in which a huge space will be created where we want to support all sorts of creativity by young people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .
a festival called " chopin and his europe " will be held in august and the three-week international piano chopin competition - where 100 pianists perform only works by chopin - takes place in october . chopin in 3d in one of poland 's leading film studios in the city of lodz , an international crew is busy shooting a 3d co-production set to chopin 's music .
" the flying machine " is being made by the uk 's breahthru films , the makers of academy award-winning " peter and the wolf , " and poland 's se-ma-for studio . the music in the film is played by lang lang , who finds the combination of a cartoon with chopin 's piano harmonies very appropriate . " i started watching ' tom and jerry ' to get into classical music and to get into piano playing , " he said , tongue-in-cheek .
" cartoon , animation and music is always connected so closely , you can not find a better context to put music and animation together . " it 's been an enormous pleasure for me to share chopin 's music with everyone in the world through making this movie , " added the star pianist . author : rafal kiepuszewski editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

theoretically , terrorists could use such a breach to gain admittance to restricted areas of the airport .
" the system was relatively simple to crack .
we were quite honestly shocked to find there were absolutely no obstacles that we had to overcome , " said chaos computer club member , karsten nohl .
the ccc hacked the legic prime entry system using a device that covertly read the identification cards of airport personnel and saved the data .
according to the " kontraste " show aired on thursday , the system is used by hamburg , berlin-tegel , stuttgart , dresden and hannover airports .
at hamburg airport , the hackers were able to get into the ' airside ' area without detection .
however , an airport spokeswoman told the program that employees normally are required to show their id and go through a security inspection before entering the restricted areas .
stuttgart airport officials said their multi-level security system would prevent breaches like the one that occurred in hamburg because they did not store any data on the employee id cards .
an interior ministry spokesman told the news magazine that they had asked for a meeting with the airport operators to review security procedures .
the head of the german police officers ' union , rainer wendt , said the old system should be removed immediately and replaced with more up-to-date technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 14.01.2010 piracy on the high seas hits peak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates raised their game in 2009 a new report by the international maritime bureau has revealed that piracy rose to its highest level in six years in 2009 , but the eu anti-piracy operation atalanta prevented the rate from rising even further . pirate attacks around the world have more than tripled in 2009 according to the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- .
in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .
" all three work in coordination with each other , sharing information and resources , and i think all three work together equally , " mukundan said .
in the gulf of aden , 116 successful or attempted attacks took place , compared with 92 in 2008 .
large carriers were targeted most often .
" as of december 31 , suspected somali pirates were holding 12 vessels for ransom with 263 crew-members of various nationalities as hostages , " the imb report said .
not just somalis the report also pointed to a rise in the number of attacks in other areas , especially the south china seas , where there was the largest number of hijackings for five years .
on top of this , piracy around south america more than doubled in 2009 .
but attacks in the malacca strait , which was a world piracy hotspot just a few years ago , remained at just two in 2009 , the same as the previous year , the imb said. bk / afp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .
" all three work in coordination with each other , sharing information and resources , and i think all three work together equally , " mukundan said .
in the gulf of aden , 116 successful or attempted attacks took place , compared with 92 in 2008 .
large carriers were targeted most often .
" as of december 31 , suspected somali pirates were holding 12 vessels for ransom with 263 crew-members of various nationalities as hostages , " the imb report said .

karim popal , an afghan-born german lawyer based in bremen who represents some of the afghans who lost family members in the attack , said he has reached a general agreement with the defense ministry on the compensation .
immediate compensation will aim to help the families through the winter and will include food , clothing , blankets and fuel , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popal has been criticized for his handling of the case while details and costs of long-term compensation projects have not yet been negotiated , popal said he imagined they would include the establishment of an orphanage , an agricultural cooperative and a carpet weaving facility .
attack surrounded with controversy popal also assured reporters all of his 79 clients are supportive of the idea .
he has rejected claims by some critics that some of his clients have dropped out of the group he represents .
he has also been accused of exaggerating the number of civilian casualties in the attack , which took place on september 4 in the northern city of kunduz and has caused major controversy in germany .
according to popal , a team of six lawyers traveled to afghanistan to interview survivors of the attack and gather information on the victims .
he says he has exact documentation of at least 113 deaths , but that the complete number is likely 137 civilians .
not included in that number are 20 injured and 22 missing , bringing the number of civilian casualities to 179 , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.01.2010 eu official calls cyber attacks on chinese political activists " worrying " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans of google are begging it to stay amid threats of a pullout google has been praised for refusing to keep facilitating censorship of its chinese services .
but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.01.2010 as bundesliga re-starts , tussles at top and bottom mean plenty of drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders leverkusen are being hunted by a closing pack german soccer 's winter break is over - hostilities resumed last weekend .
with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

theoretically , terrorists could use such a breach to gain admittance to restricted areas of the airport .
" the system was relatively simple to crack .
we were quite honestly shocked to find there were absolutely no obstacles that we had to overcome , " said chaos computer club member , karsten nohl .
the ccc hacked the legic prime entry system using a device that covertly read the identification cards of airport personnel and saved the data .
according to the " kontraste " show aired on thursday , the system is used by hamburg , berlin-tegel , stuttgart , dresden and hannover airports .
at hamburg airport , the hackers were able to get into the ' airside ' area without detection .
however , an airport spokeswoman told the program that employees normally are required to show their id and go through a security inspection before entering the restricted areas .
stuttgart airport officials said their multi-level security system would prevent breaches like the one that occurred in hamburg because they did not store any data on the employee id cards .
an interior ministry spokesman told the news magazine that they had asked for a meeting with the airport operators to review security procedures .
the head of the german police officers ' union , rainer wendt , said the old system should be removed immediately and replaced with more up-to-date technology .
" the security department should immediately be put under the supervision of the national police so that the airport operators can no longer just carelessly do whatever they want , " wendt said. svs / ard editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu ministers are meeting informally in spain to discuss what european energy policy will be like in the future .
a mix of sustainable energy sources and infrastructure connecting countries could reduce emissions . nearly a month after the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , european union ministers are meeting in seville to discuss the future of energy in europe .
an informal council meeting will focus on the european strategic energy technology plan and the european energy action plan for 2010-2014 , which addresses environmental sustainability along with the security of european energy supplies .
the meeting will continue through sunday and coincides with an informal meeting of the european ministers of energy and environment , to be held friday and saturday , also in seville .
antonio hernandez garcia , director general for energy policy and mines at the spanish ministry of industry , said : ' energy policy can not be conceived without sustainability . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts about energy sources such as natural gas could be avoided .
hernandez garcia stated spain will work to diversify european energy sources and develop infrastructure connecting countries during the term of its european union presidency .
doing so may help avoid conflicts similar to those over gas , which have occurred between russia and the ukraine .
alternative energies analyzed by the european strategic energy technology plan include : solar , thermal-solar and photovoltaic and wind power on land and sea .
rainer hinrichs-rahlwes , vice president of the european renewable energies federation , said despite the copenhagen conference results ministers would do well to work on an agreement increasing the planned cut in european emissions from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
' it would certainly be sensible to reach an agreement within the european union very early on , ' he said . ' it must be made clear that we need to continue with higher goals than planned .
these goals can be reached with renewable energy sources . '

karim popal , an afghan-born german lawyer based in bremen who represents some of the afghans who lost family members in the attack , said he has reached a general agreement with the defense ministry on the compensation .
immediate compensation will aim to help the families through the winter and will include food , clothing , blankets and fuel , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popal has been criticized for his handling of the case while details and costs of long-term compensation projects have not yet been negotiated , popal said he imagined they would include the establishment of an orphanage , an agricultural cooperative and a carpet weaving facility .
attack surrounded with controversy popal also assured reporters all of his 79 clients are supportive of the idea .
he has rejected claims by some critics that some of his clients have dropped out of the group he represents .
he has also been accused of exaggerating the number of civilian casualties in the attack , which took place on september 4 in the northern city of kunduz and has caused major controversy in germany .
according to popal , a team of six lawyers traveled to afghanistan to interview survivors of the attack and gather information on the victims .
he says he has exact documentation of at least 113 deaths , but that the complete number is likely 137 civilians .
not included in that number are 20 injured and 22 missing , bringing the number of civilian casualities to 179 , he said .

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .
you can hear all that in his music , " said strugala . the asian connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang lang says chopin 's music works well with animation a year-long season commemorating the 200th anniversary of chopin 's birth was officially launched earlier this month with a gala concert at the warsaw philharmonic featuring 27-year-old chinese pianist lang lang .
according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .
" one of the features will be an outside mural , a street art activity , in which a huge space will be created where we want to support all sorts of creativity by young people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .
a festival called " chopin and his europe " will be held in august and the three-week international piano chopin competition - where 100 pianists perform only works by chopin - takes place in october . chopin in 3d in one of poland 's leading film studios in the city of lodz , an international crew is busy shooting a 3d co-production set to chopin 's music .
" the flying machine " is being made by the uk 's breahthru films , the makers of academy award-winning " peter and the wolf , " and poland 's se-ma-for studio . the music in the film is played by lang lang , who finds the combination of a cartoon with chopin 's piano harmonies very appropriate . " i started watching ' tom and jerry ' to get into classical music and to get into piano playing , " he said , tongue-in-cheek .
" cartoon , animation and music is always connected so closely , you can not find a better context to put music and animation together . " it 's been an enormous pleasure for me to share chopin 's music with everyone in the world through making this movie , " added the star pianist . author : rafal kiepuszewski editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

eu ministers are meeting informally in spain to discuss what european energy policy will be like in the future .
a mix of sustainable energy sources and infrastructure connecting countries could reduce emissions . nearly a month after the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , european union ministers are meeting in seville to discuss the future of energy in europe .
an informal council meeting will focus on the european strategic energy technology plan and the european energy action plan for 2010-2014 , which addresses environmental sustainability along with the security of european energy supplies .
the meeting will continue through sunday and coincides with an informal meeting of the european ministers of energy and environment , to be held friday and saturday , also in seville .
antonio hernandez garcia , director general for energy policy and mines at the spanish ministry of industry , said : ' energy policy can not be conceived without sustainability . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts about energy sources such as natural gas could be avoided .
hernandez garcia stated spain will work to diversify european energy sources and develop infrastructure connecting countries during the term of its european union presidency .
doing so may help avoid conflicts similar to those over gas , which have occurred between russia and the ukraine .
alternative energies analyzed by the european strategic energy technology plan include : solar , thermal-solar and photovoltaic and wind power on land and sea .
rainer hinrichs-rahlwes , vice president of the european renewable energies federation , said despite the copenhagen conference results ministers would do well to work on an agreement increasing the planned cut in european emissions from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
' it would certainly be sensible to reach an agreement within the european union very early on , ' he said . ' it must be made clear that we need to continue with higher goals than planned .
these goals can be reached with renewable energy sources . '

eu ministers are meeting informally in spain to discuss what european energy policy will be like in the future .
a mix of sustainable energy sources and infrastructure connecting countries could reduce emissions . nearly a month after the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , european union ministers are meeting in seville to discuss the future of energy in europe .
an informal council meeting will focus on the european strategic energy technology plan and the european energy action plan for 2010-2014 , which addresses environmental sustainability along with the security of european energy supplies .
the meeting will continue through sunday and coincides with an informal meeting of the european ministers of energy and environment , to be held friday and saturday , also in seville .
antonio hernandez garcia , director general for energy policy and mines at the spanish ministry of industry , said : ' energy policy can not be conceived without sustainability . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts about energy sources such as natural gas could be avoided .
hernandez garcia stated spain will work to diversify european energy sources and develop infrastructure connecting countries during the term of its european union presidency .
doing so may help avoid conflicts similar to those over gas , which have occurred between russia and the ukraine .
alternative energies analyzed by the european strategic energy technology plan include : solar , thermal-solar and photovoltaic and wind power on land and sea .
rainer hinrichs-rahlwes , vice president of the european renewable energies federation , said despite the copenhagen conference results ministers would do well to work on an agreement increasing the planned cut in european emissions from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
' it would certainly be sensible to reach an agreement within the european union very early on , ' he said . ' it must be made clear that we need to continue with higher goals than planned .
these goals can be reached with renewable energy sources . '

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .

" life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .

vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

consumer groups are calling for millions of euros in compensation . germany 's cartel office launched raids on major retail chains on thursday as part of an investigation into alleged price-fixing .
several of the country 's biggest supermarkets , chemists and pet supply stores were among those checked by the authorities .
the focus of the investigation was on the prices for sweets , coffee and pet food .
in total 24 companies are under suspicion of agreeing to set minimum prices for some of their items .
" the suspicions we had were based on several different ongoing investigations in the recent past , " said kay weidner , spokesperson of the cartel office . consumers " ripped off " consumer protection organizations have reacted by calling for compensation to be paid to consumers who had been " ripped off . "
" should these suspicions turn out to be true , then this will shatter consumers ' trust in our market economy , " said gerd billen of the german consumer protection group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supermarket lidl is one of those suspected of " ripping off " customers price-fixing is illegal in germany and authorities have warned of high fines should the suspicions be confirmed .
fines can be up to 10 percent of annual turnover .
in an earlier price-fixing scam over coffee , the three companies involved were fined a total of 160 million euros -lrb- $ 230 million -rrb- .
companies pledge to cooperate more than 100 police officers and officials were involved in the operation and companies checked included some of the sectors ' biggest names , such as metro , edeka , rewe or the discount supermarket lidl .
most of the companies involved have said they will support the investigations - as authorities have indicated that fines will be lower for those who cooperate with the police .
traditionally , retailers agree terms with their suppliers at annual meetings .
authorities suspect that they also agreed illegally what the minimum retail prices should be for certain brand products .
the price fixing scandal comes at a time when german supermarkets are locked in a price war , with discount supermarket aldi announcing on thursday that it would lower prices by up to 23 percent .

consumer groups are calling for millions of euros in compensation . germany 's cartel office launched raids on major retail chains on thursday as part of an investigation into alleged price-fixing .
several of the country 's biggest supermarkets , chemists and pet supply stores were among those checked by the authorities .
the focus of the investigation was on the prices for sweets , coffee and pet food .
in total 24 companies are under suspicion of agreeing to set minimum prices for some of their items .
" the suspicions we had were based on several different ongoing investigations in the recent past , " said kay weidner , spokesperson of the cartel office . consumers " ripped off " consumer protection organizations have reacted by calling for compensation to be paid to consumers who had been " ripped off . "
" should these suspicions turn out to be true , then this will shatter consumers ' trust in our market economy , " said gerd billen of the german consumer protection group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supermarket lidl is one of those suspected of " ripping off " customers price-fixing is illegal in germany and authorities have warned of high fines should the suspicions be confirmed .
fines can be up to 10 percent of annual turnover .
in an earlier price-fixing scam over coffee , the three companies involved were fined a total of 160 million euros -lrb- $ 230 million -rrb- .
companies pledge to cooperate more than 100 police officers and officials were involved in the operation and companies checked included some of the sectors ' biggest names , such as metro , edeka , rewe or the discount supermarket lidl .
most of the companies involved have said they will support the investigations - as authorities have indicated that fines will be lower for those who cooperate with the police .
traditionally , retailers agree terms with their suppliers at annual meetings .
authorities suspect that they also agreed illegally what the minimum retail prices should be for certain brand products .
the price fixing scandal comes at a time when german supermarkets are locked in a price war , with discount supermarket aldi announcing on thursday that it would lower prices by up to 23 percent .
competitors have already announced they will follow suit. ai / dpa / reuters / apd editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.01.2010 as bundesliga re-starts , tussles at top and bottom mean plenty of drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders leverkusen are being hunted by a closing pack german soccer 's winter break is over - hostilities resumed last weekend .
with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .

the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .

" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .

consumer groups are calling for millions of euros in compensation . germany 's cartel office launched raids on major retail chains on thursday as part of an investigation into alleged price-fixing .
several of the country 's biggest supermarkets , chemists and pet supply stores were among those checked by the authorities .
the focus of the investigation was on the prices for sweets , coffee and pet food .
in total 24 companies are under suspicion of agreeing to set minimum prices for some of their items .
" the suspicions we had were based on several different ongoing investigations in the recent past , " said kay weidner , spokesperson of the cartel office . consumers " ripped off " consumer protection organizations have reacted by calling for compensation to be paid to consumers who had been " ripped off . "
" should these suspicions turn out to be true , then this will shatter consumers ' trust in our market economy , " said gerd billen of the german consumer protection group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supermarket lidl is one of those suspected of " ripping off " customers price-fixing is illegal in germany and authorities have warned of high fines should the suspicions be confirmed .
fines can be up to 10 percent of annual turnover .
in an earlier price-fixing scam over coffee , the three companies involved were fined a total of 160 million euros -lrb- $ 230 million -rrb- .
companies pledge to cooperate more than 100 police officers and officials were involved in the operation and companies checked included some of the sectors ' biggest names , such as metro , edeka , rewe or the discount supermarket lidl .
most of the companies involved have said they will support the investigations - as authorities have indicated that fines will be lower for those who cooperate with the police .
traditionally , retailers agree terms with their suppliers at annual meetings .
authorities suspect that they also agreed illegally what the minimum retail prices should be for certain brand products .

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karim popal , an afghan-born german lawyer based in bremen who represents some of the afghans who lost family members in the attack , said he has reached a general agreement with the defense ministry on the compensation .
immediate compensation will aim to help the families through the winter and will include food , clothing , blankets and fuel , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popal has been criticized for his handling of the case while details and costs of long-term compensation projects have not yet been negotiated , popal said he imagined they would include the establishment of an orphanage , an agricultural cooperative and a carpet weaving facility .
attack surrounded with controversy popal also assured reporters all of his 79 clients are supportive of the idea .
he has rejected claims by some critics that some of his clients have dropped out of the group he represents .
he has also been accused of exaggerating the number of civilian casualties in the attack , which took place on september 4 in the northern city of kunduz and has caused major controversy in germany .
according to popal , a team of six lawyers traveled to afghanistan to interview survivors of the attack and gather information on the victims .
he says he has exact documentation of at least 113 deaths , but that the complete number is likely 137 civilians .
not included in that number are 20 injured and 22 missing , bringing the number of civilian casualities to 179 , he said .

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .
you can hear all that in his music , " said strugala . the asian connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang lang says chopin 's music works well with animation a year-long season commemorating the 200th anniversary of chopin 's birth was officially launched earlier this month with a gala concert at the warsaw philharmonic featuring 27-year-old chinese pianist lang lang .
according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .
a festival called " chopin and his europe " will be held in august and the three-week international piano chopin competition - where 100 pianists perform only works by chopin - takes place in october . chopin in 3d in one of poland 's leading film studios in the city of lodz , an international crew is busy shooting a 3d co-production set to chopin 's music .

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .
you can hear all that in his music , " said strugala . the asian connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang lang says chopin 's music works well with animation a year-long season commemorating the 200th anniversary of chopin 's birth was officially launched earlier this month with a gala concert at the warsaw philharmonic featuring 27-year-old chinese pianist lang lang .
according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .
" one of the features will be an outside mural , a street art activity , in which a huge space will be created where we want to support all sorts of creativity by young people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .
a festival called " chopin and his europe " will be held in august and the three-week international piano chopin competition - where 100 pianists perform only works by chopin - takes place in october . chopin in 3d in one of poland 's leading film studios in the city of lodz , an international crew is busy shooting a 3d co-production set to chopin 's music .
" the flying machine " is being made by the uk 's breahthru films , the makers of academy award-winning " peter and the wolf , " and poland 's se-ma-for studio . the music in the film is played by lang lang , who finds the combination of a cartoon with chopin 's piano harmonies very appropriate . " i started watching ' tom and jerry ' to get into classical music and to get into piano playing , " he said , tongue-in-cheek .
" cartoon , animation and music is always connected so closely , you can not find a better context to put music and animation together . " it 's been an enormous pleasure for me to share chopin 's music with everyone in the world through making this movie , " added the star pianist . author : rafal kiepuszewski editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 14.01.2010 experts could not have predicted haiti earthquake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti is situated on an earthquake fault line which has been dormant for 240 years tuesday 's massive earthquake near to the capital of haiti has resulted in thousands of deaths .
more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 14.01.2010 piracy on the high seas hits peak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates raised their game in 2009 a new report by the international maritime bureau has revealed that piracy rose to its highest level in six years in 2009 , but the eu anti-piracy operation atalanta prevented the rate from rising even further . pirate attacks around the world have more than tripled in 2009 according to the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- .
in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .

in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .

more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 14.01.2010 german lawyer represents khmer rouge victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silke studzinsky has been representing the civil parties at the un-backed genocide tribunal since 2008 roughly two million people - a fifth of the entire cambodian population - died during the khmer rouge ’ s terror regime .
30 years later , the legal reckoning has only just begun .
the hearing of the first accused , duch - the head of the infamous s21 prison and torture centre - recently came to an end .
the sentence is expected to be handed down within a few months .
thomas bärthlein spoke to a german lawyer who has been representing the khmer rouge victims in court . in 2008 , the german development service sent berlin lawyer silke studzinsky to phnom penh as part of the civilian peace service programme .
since then , it has been her task to represent the civil parties - the victims - at the un-backed genocide tribunal .
studzinsky has already achieved a great deal .
without her , the fact that the khmer rouge systematically used sexual violence would have remained in the dark .
the fact that they forced people to marry en masse , for example , has been overshadowed by the sheer scale of murder and torture .
“ the general perception is that the khmer rouge murdered and tortured , ” explained silke studzinsky , “ but that they punished sexual violence , when it occurred , very strictly because they were puritanical .
male historians have perpetuated this perception . ”
although silke studzinsky had little experience of cambodia before arriving , she had already done a lot of work on sexual violence .
“ people would mention before , almost in passing , that they had been forced to marry , ” she said .
“ but nobody asked any probing questions !
such as ‚ what does forced mean ? ’
were you ordered to have sex ?
what was the point ?
and if no questions are asked then no answers are given , especially not with this kind of topic . “ this little-known aspect of the khmer rouge era was examined at the end of duch ’ s trial .
many cambodians see themselves as victims silke studzinsky confirmed that the trial had come as a great relief to the victims who were able to speak out against duch .
but she was also critical of cambodia ’ s way of dealing with the past .
“ here everyone tends to think of themselves as victims .
and the young generation has not really questioned this role of the victim .
the idea is that that pol pot controlled everything and everyone else had to follow , otherwise they themselves would have been killed .
the great majority of those who were alive at the time have taken refuge in this role of the victim . ”
duch himself used this as his defence , saying he had no choice .
moreover , his lawyers alleged that the prosecution had made random choices .
they also said that duch was a scapegoat and that other , much worse , criminals remained at large .
“ no equality in injustice ” silke studzinsky agreed that the list of the accused is incomplete but said duch could not use this to talk his way out .
“ there is no equality in injustice .
this line of defence - that other prison heads should be on the accused bench before him according to a kind of ranking of how many victims died where - that his national lawyers in particular are using has no foundation . ”
hearings against four more accused are expected to take place in 2011 .
trials for five other khmer rouge leaders who have not yet been named are also probable .

30 years later , the legal reckoning has only just begun .
the hearing of the first accused , duch - the head of the infamous s21 prison and torture centre - recently came to an end .
the sentence is expected to be handed down within a few months .
thomas bärthlein spoke to a german lawyer who has been representing the khmer rouge victims in court . in 2008 , the german development service sent berlin lawyer silke studzinsky to phnom penh as part of the civilian peace service programme .
since then , it has been her task to represent the civil parties - the victims - at the un-backed genocide tribunal .
studzinsky has already achieved a great deal .
without her , the fact that the khmer rouge systematically used sexual violence would have remained in the dark .
the fact that they forced people to marry en masse , for example , has been overshadowed by the sheer scale of murder and torture .
“ the general perception is that the khmer rouge murdered and tortured , ” explained silke studzinsky , “ but that they punished sexual violence , when it occurred , very strictly because they were puritanical .
male historians have perpetuated this perception . ”
although silke studzinsky had little experience of cambodia before arriving , she had already done a lot of work on sexual violence .
“ people would mention before , almost in passing , that they had been forced to marry , ” she said .
“ but nobody asked any probing questions !
such as ‚ what does forced mean ? ’
were you ordered to have sex ?
what was the point ?
and if no questions are asked then no answers are given , especially not with this kind of topic . “ this little-known aspect of the khmer rouge era was examined at the end of duch ’ s trial .
many cambodians see themselves as victims silke studzinsky confirmed that the trial had come as a great relief to the victims who were able to speak out against duch .
but she was also critical of cambodia ’ s way of dealing with the past .
“ here everyone tends to think of themselves as victims .
and the young generation has not really questioned this role of the victim .
the idea is that that pol pot controlled everything and everyone else had to follow , otherwise they themselves would have been killed .
the great majority of those who were alive at the time have taken refuge in this role of the victim . ”
duch himself used this as his defence , saying he had no choice .
moreover , his lawyers alleged that the prosecution had made random choices .
they also said that duch was a scapegoat and that other , much worse , criminals remained at large .
“ no equality in injustice ” silke studzinsky agreed that the list of the accused is incomplete but said duch could not use this to talk his way out .
“ there is no equality in injustice .
this line of defence - that other prison heads should be on the accused bench before him according to a kind of ranking of how many victims died where - that his national lawyers in particular are using has no foundation . ”
hearings against four more accused are expected to take place in 2011 .
trials for five other khmer rouge leaders who have not yet been named are also probable .
they are likely to be summoned and arrested in the near future , said studzinsky who will continue to represent the victims of the khmer rouge in court .

in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

30 years later , the legal reckoning has only just begun .
the hearing of the first accused , duch - the head of the infamous s21 prison and torture centre - recently came to an end .
the sentence is expected to be handed down within a few months .
thomas bärthlein spoke to a german lawyer who has been representing the khmer rouge victims in court . in 2008 , the german development service sent berlin lawyer silke studzinsky to phnom penh as part of the civilian peace service programme .
since then , it has been her task to represent the civil parties - the victims - at the un-backed genocide tribunal .
studzinsky has already achieved a great deal .
without her , the fact that the khmer rouge systematically used sexual violence would have remained in the dark .
the fact that they forced people to marry en masse , for example , has been overshadowed by the sheer scale of murder and torture .
“ the general perception is that the khmer rouge murdered and tortured , ” explained silke studzinsky , “ but that they punished sexual violence , when it occurred , very strictly because they were puritanical .
male historians have perpetuated this perception . ”
although silke studzinsky had little experience of cambodia before arriving , she had already done a lot of work on sexual violence .
“ people would mention before , almost in passing , that they had been forced to marry , ” she said .
“ but nobody asked any probing questions !
such as ‚ what does forced mean ? ’
were you ordered to have sex ?
what was the point ?
and if no questions are asked then no answers are given , especially not with this kind of topic . “ this little-known aspect of the khmer rouge era was examined at the end of duch ’ s trial .
many cambodians see themselves as victims silke studzinsky confirmed that the trial had come as a great relief to the victims who were able to speak out against duch .
but she was also critical of cambodia ’ s way of dealing with the past .
“ here everyone tends to think of themselves as victims .
and the young generation has not really questioned this role of the victim .
the idea is that that pol pot controlled everything and everyone else had to follow , otherwise they themselves would have been killed .
the great majority of those who were alive at the time have taken refuge in this role of the victim . ”

in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 14.01.2010 german lawyer represents khmer rouge victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silke studzinsky has been representing the civil parties at the un-backed genocide tribunal since 2008 roughly two million people - a fifth of the entire cambodian population - died during the khmer rouge ’ s terror regime .
30 years later , the legal reckoning has only just begun .
the hearing of the first accused , duch - the head of the infamous s21 prison and torture centre - recently came to an end .
the sentence is expected to be handed down within a few months .
thomas bärthlein spoke to a german lawyer who has been representing the khmer rouge victims in court . in 2008 , the german development service sent berlin lawyer silke studzinsky to phnom penh as part of the civilian peace service programme .
since then , it has been her task to represent the civil parties - the victims - at the un-backed genocide tribunal .
studzinsky has already achieved a great deal .
without her , the fact that the khmer rouge systematically used sexual violence would have remained in the dark .
the fact that they forced people to marry en masse , for example , has been overshadowed by the sheer scale of murder and torture .
“ the general perception is that the khmer rouge murdered and tortured , ” explained silke studzinsky , “ but that they punished sexual violence , when it occurred , very strictly because they were puritanical .
male historians have perpetuated this perception . ”
although silke studzinsky had little experience of cambodia before arriving , she had already done a lot of work on sexual violence .
“ people would mention before , almost in passing , that they had been forced to marry , ” she said .
“ but nobody asked any probing questions !
such as ‚ what does forced mean ? ’
were you ordered to have sex ?
what was the point ?
and if no questions are asked then no answers are given , especially not with this kind of topic . “ this little-known aspect of the khmer rouge era was examined at the end of duch ’ s trial .
many cambodians see themselves as victims silke studzinsky confirmed that the trial had come as a great relief to the victims who were able to speak out against duch .
but she was also critical of cambodia ’ s way of dealing with the past .
“ here everyone tends to think of themselves as victims .
and the young generation has not really questioned this role of the victim .
the idea is that that pol pot controlled everything and everyone else had to follow , otherwise they themselves would have been killed .
the great majority of those who were alive at the time have taken refuge in this role of the victim . ”
duch himself used this as his defence , saying he had no choice .
moreover , his lawyers alleged that the prosecution had made random choices .
they also said that duch was a scapegoat and that other , much worse , criminals remained at large .
“ no equality in injustice ” silke studzinsky agreed that the list of the accused is incomplete but said duch could not use this to talk his way out .
“ there is no equality in injustice .
this line of defence - that other prison heads should be on the accused bench before him according to a kind of ranking of how many victims died where - that his national lawyers in particular are using has no foundation . ”
hearings against four more accused are expected to take place in 2011 .
trials for five other khmer rouge leaders who have not yet been named are also probable .
they are likely to be summoned and arrested in the near future , said studzinsky who will continue to represent the victims of the khmer rouge in court .
she recently extended her contract until the end of 2010 .

consumer groups are calling for millions of euros in compensation . germany 's cartel office launched raids on major retail chains on thursday as part of an investigation into alleged price-fixing .
several of the country 's biggest supermarkets , chemists and pet supply stores were among those checked by the authorities .
the focus of the investigation was on the prices for sweets , coffee and pet food .
in total 24 companies are under suspicion of agreeing to set minimum prices for some of their items .
" the suspicions we had were based on several different ongoing investigations in the recent past , " said kay weidner , spokesperson of the cartel office . consumers " ripped off " consumer protection organizations have reacted by calling for compensation to be paid to consumers who had been " ripped off . "
" should these suspicions turn out to be true , then this will shatter consumers ' trust in our market economy , " said gerd billen of the german consumer protection group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supermarket lidl is one of those suspected of " ripping off " customers price-fixing is illegal in germany and authorities have warned of high fines should the suspicions be confirmed .
fines can be up to 10 percent of annual turnover .
in an earlier price-fixing scam over coffee , the three companies involved were fined a total of 160 million euros -lrb- $ 230 million -rrb- .
companies pledge to cooperate more than 100 police officers and officials were involved in the operation and companies checked included some of the sectors ' biggest names , such as metro , edeka , rewe or the discount supermarket lidl .
most of the companies involved have said they will support the investigations - as authorities have indicated that fines will be lower for those who cooperate with the police .
traditionally , retailers agree terms with their suppliers at annual meetings .
authorities suspect that they also agreed illegally what the minimum retail prices should be for certain brand products .
the price fixing scandal comes at a time when german supermarkets are locked in a price war , with discount supermarket aldi announcing on thursday that it would lower prices by up to 23 percent .
competitors have already announced they will follow suit. ai / dpa / reuters / apd editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 14.01.2010 green week opens under cloud of price-war pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food trade needs a fairness overhaul , one critic says price pressure is a topic at this year 's green week food and agriculture trade fair , which opens friday in berlin .
germany producers are feeling the pinch , and a way out seems hard to find . even as the world 's largest fair for food , agriculture and horticulture was set to open , more fuel was being poured onto the already heated debate over food prices and quality .
this week , a number of food discounters in germany - led by market leader aldi - continued an ongoing price war with yet another round of cuts , this time on items ranging from vegetable oil to breakfast cereal to snack chips .
there were 12 such major price reductions over the course of 2009 .
speaking at the fair , german agriculture minister ilse aigner said she was " very concerned " about what she saw as " acrimonious competition " as the discounters vied for market share .
" if pricing sets the rule in our country , then at some point the quality will suffer , and in the end , so will the consumer , " she said .
" society must know the value of high-quality and safe foods . "
earlier in the week , food industry association bve sharply criticized the " ruinous competition " in food production , and called for it to stop immediately .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ilse aigner says quality counts according to bve , discount markets account for 44 percent of the food sold in germany .
the green week comprises 1600 exhibitors from 56 countries .
two-thirds of those exhibitors come from germany , and the issue of food prices is a serious one for the country 's food industry as a whole .
with penny-pinching customers flocking to the discounters , help for food producers may have to come from outside the german borders , if at all .
spending less , getting the same amount germans only spend 11 percent of their income on food , according to industry statistics , and producers are feeling the pinch .
revenue in 2009 fell four percent from the previous year , food industry spokesman juergen abraham told deutsche welle , despite the fact that unit sales remained constant . " consumers have n't eaten less , but the food industry has had to adjust to a reduction in revenue .
it 's dramatic for the 5,800 companies and 530,000 workers who have suffered from the situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi is leading the price wars it is n't only the food industry , agricultural producers are also groaning about the problem .
prices of milk , butter and meat are as low as ever in germany , meaning they have to depend on exports .
currently , about a fifth of all meat and dairy products as well as 12 percent of sweets and packaged baked goods made in germany are sold outside of the country .
yet export numbers have been falling as well , dropping 5 percent from 2008 to 2009 .
" the financial and economic crisis has hit exports hard , since in many importing countries the currencies have crashed , " said gerd sonnleitner , president of the german farmers ' union -lrb- dbv -rrb- .
" for us in the agricultural sector it is very important to get the world economy going again . "
world food trade due for a rehaul ?
agricultural products " made in germany " have a good reputation both inside and outside of the country , sonnleitner said , but they are n't in the top price segment .
some 80 percent of german agricultural exports go to eu countries , while in industrial food production that number reaches 84 percent .
outside the eu , russia , switzerland and the us are the key importers of german foodstuffs .
now germans are hoping to improve their market share in emerging and developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices are hovering at low levels but what may save the german food industry may also be the death of the food industries in developing markets . the sale of cheap agricultural products from industrial countries is harmful for them , according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur for the right to food .
the trade in food throughout the world , he said , needs fundamental change .
" we all know that the current trading system does n't work to the advantage -lsb- of people in developing countries -rsb- , " he told deutsche welle , explaining that it hurts producers in poor countries who do n't have access to highly developed markets .
it also distorts competition in their own countries , because industrialized nations can offer highly subsidized , and cheap , foods .
the issue of milk powder for example , imported milk powder in a developing market can be less expensive than local milk .
in bangladesh , farmers recently protested , demanding a stop to milk powder imports .
but the farming association head sonnleitner rejects those arguments , saying it is mostly problems such as civil war , corruption , and a lack of civil rights that distort the marketplaces there .
" i always find it unfair that we are accused of destroying these countries with agricultural exports .
small sums of money and small amounts of foods are blown up out of proportion , " he said .
and as long as the german market remains difficult for food producers , there will be a strong incentive to look abroad for solutions .

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .

china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .

" the wfp also has a hub for emergency response in el salvador , so more high energy biscuits will be arriving shortly , " suedhoff said .

theoretically , terrorists could use such a breach to gain admittance to restricted areas of the airport .
" the system was relatively simple to crack .
we were quite honestly shocked to find there were absolutely no obstacles that we had to overcome , " said chaos computer club member , karsten nohl .
the ccc hacked the legic prime entry system using a device that covertly read the identification cards of airport personnel and saved the data .
according to the " kontraste " show aired on thursday , the system is used by hamburg , berlin-tegel , stuttgart , dresden and hannover airports .
at hamburg airport , the hackers were able to get into the ' airside ' area without detection .
however , an airport spokeswoman told the program that employees normally are required to show their id and go through a security inspection before entering the restricted areas .
stuttgart airport officials said their multi-level security system would prevent breaches like the one that occurred in hamburg because they did not store any data on the employee id cards .
an interior ministry spokesman told the news magazine that they had asked for a meeting with the airport operators to review security procedures .
the head of the german police officers ' union , rainer wendt , said the old system should be removed immediately and replaced with more up-to-date technology .
" the security department should immediately be put under the supervision of the national police so that the airport operators can no longer just carelessly do whatever they want , " wendt said. svs / ard editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .

greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .

the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .

nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .

the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .

eu ministers are meeting informally in spain to discuss what european energy policy will be like in the future .
a mix of sustainable energy sources and infrastructure connecting countries could reduce emissions . nearly a month after the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , european union ministers are meeting in seville to discuss the future of energy in europe .
an informal council meeting will focus on the european strategic energy technology plan and the european energy action plan for 2010-2014 , which addresses environmental sustainability along with the security of european energy supplies .
the meeting will continue through sunday and coincides with an informal meeting of the european ministers of energy and environment , to be held friday and saturday , also in seville .
antonio hernandez garcia , director general for energy policy and mines at the spanish ministry of industry , said : ' energy policy can not be conceived without sustainability . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts about energy sources such as natural gas could be avoided .
hernandez garcia stated spain will work to diversify european energy sources and develop infrastructure connecting countries during the term of its european union presidency .
doing so may help avoid conflicts similar to those over gas , which have occurred between russia and the ukraine .
alternative energies analyzed by the european strategic energy technology plan include : solar , thermal-solar and photovoltaic and wind power on land and sea .
rainer hinrichs-rahlwes , vice president of the european renewable energies federation , said despite the copenhagen conference results ministers would do well to work on an agreement increasing the planned cut in european emissions from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
' it would certainly be sensible to reach an agreement within the european union very early on , ' he said . ' it must be made clear that we need to continue with higher goals than planned .
these goals can be reached with renewable energy sources . '

in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .
" all three work in coordination with each other , sharing information and resources , and i think all three work together equally , " mukundan said .
in the gulf of aden , 116 successful or attempted attacks took place , compared with 92 in 2008 .
large carriers were targeted most often .
" as of december 31 , suspected somali pirates were holding 12 vessels for ransom with 263 crew-members of various nationalities as hostages , " the imb report said .
not just somalis the report also pointed to a rise in the number of attacks in other areas , especially the south china seas , where there was the largest number of hijackings for five years .
on top of this , piracy around south america more than doubled in 2009 .
but attacks in the malacca strait , which was a world piracy hotspot just a few years ago , remained at just two in 2009 , the same as the previous year , the imb said. bk / afp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .

more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 14.01.2010 even before deadly quake , haiti 's situation was dire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lives of many in haiti have been difficult for decades or longer at its founding haiti was a beacon of freedom , now it is the poorhouse of the western hemisphere .
even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .

for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .

vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .
you can hear all that in his music , " said strugala . the asian connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang lang says chopin 's music works well with animation a year-long season commemorating the 200th anniversary of chopin 's birth was officially launched earlier this month with a gala concert at the warsaw philharmonic featuring 27-year-old chinese pianist lang lang .
according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .

the focus of the investigation was on the prices for sweets , coffee and pet food .
in total 24 companies are under suspicion of agreeing to set minimum prices for some of their items .
" the suspicions we had were based on several different ongoing investigations in the recent past , " said kay weidner , spokesperson of the cartel office . consumers " ripped off " consumer protection organizations have reacted by calling for compensation to be paid to consumers who had been " ripped off .

karim popal , an afghan-born german lawyer based in bremen who represents some of the afghans who lost family members in the attack , said he has reached a general agreement with the defense ministry on the compensation .
immediate compensation will aim to help the families through the winter and will include food , clothing , blankets and fuel , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popal has been criticized for his handling of the case while details and costs of long-term compensation projects have not yet been negotiated , popal said he imagined they would include the establishment of an orphanage , an agricultural cooperative and a carpet weaving facility .
attack surrounded with controversy popal also assured reporters all of his 79 clients are supportive of the idea .
he has rejected claims by some critics that some of his clients have dropped out of the group he represents .
he has also been accused of exaggerating the number of civilian casualties in the attack , which took place on september 4 in the northern city of kunduz and has caused major controversy in germany .
according to popal , a team of six lawyers traveled to afghanistan to interview survivors of the attack and gather information on the victims .
he says he has exact documentation of at least 113 deaths , but that the complete number is likely 137 civilians .
not included in that number are 20 injured and 22 missing , bringing the number of civilian casualities to 179 , he said .

he says he has exact documentation of at least 113 deaths , but that the complete number is likely 137 civilians .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popal has been criticized for his handling of the case while details and costs of long-term compensation projects have not yet been negotiated , popal said he imagined they would include the establishment of an orphanage , an agricultural cooperative and a carpet weaving facility .
attack surrounded with controversy popal also assured reporters all of his 79 clients are supportive of the idea .
he has rejected claims by some critics that some of his clients have dropped out of the group he represents .
he has also been accused of exaggerating the number of civilian casualties in the attack , which took place on september 4 in the northern city of kunduz and has caused major controversy in germany .
according to popal , a team of six lawyers traveled to afghanistan to interview survivors of the attack and gather information on the victims .
he says he has exact documentation of at least 113 deaths , but that the complete number is likely 137 civilians .
not included in that number are 20 injured and 22 missing , bringing the number of civilian casualities to 179 , he said .

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .
you can hear all that in his music , " said strugala . the asian connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang lang says chopin 's music works well with animation a year-long season commemorating the 200th anniversary of chopin 's birth was officially launched earlier this month with a gala concert at the warsaw philharmonic featuring 27-year-old chinese pianist lang lang .
according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .
" one of the features will be an outside mural , a street art activity , in which a huge space will be created where we want to support all sorts of creativity by young people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .
a festival called " chopin and his europe " will be held in august and the three-week international piano chopin competition - where 100 pianists perform only works by chopin - takes place in october . chopin in 3d in one of poland 's leading film studios in the city of lodz , an international crew is busy shooting a 3d co-production set to chopin 's music .

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .

according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .
" one of the features will be an outside mural , a street art activity , in which a huge space will be created where we want to support all sorts of creativity by young people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.01.2010 eu official calls cyber attacks on chinese political activists " worrying " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans of google are begging it to stay amid threats of a pullout google has been praised for refusing to keep facilitating censorship of its chinese services .
but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its faceoff with chinese authorities continues , as eu officials express concern and china defends its position . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes cited recently revealed cyber-attacks on google services in china as proof of the importance of preserving " the open and neutral character of the net . "
google announced on tuesday that it would no longer comply with chinese government requirements that they censor search results .
it has threatened to abandon its operations in the country entirely over the discovery of cyber-attacks launched from china and aimed at political activists and foreign businesses .
google 's threat to pull out followed a china-based cyber-attack aimed at human rights activists and foreign businesses using google 's gmail e-mail service .
google said the accounts were “ routinely accessed ” through malicious software that had been unwittingly installed on users ' computers .
internet security experts speculate that what google called a " highly sophisticated " series of attacks might have links to government or political groups .
" if proven , this case would be particularly worrying as an example of targeting of human rights activists in china and elsewhere in the world , " kroes told members of the european parliament on thursday , during a hearing to judge her suitability to become the commissioner for information technologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 360 million in people use the internet in china , more than anywhere else in the world censorship or " guiding opinions " ?
china is defending its policy of widespread censorship of the internet in the face of google 's threats to withdraw from the country and shut down ' google.cn ' , its chinese web portal .
" our country is at a crucial stage of reform and development , and this is a period of marked social conflicts , " wang chen , head of the central government 's information office , said during an interview posted on the office 's website .
" properly guiding internet opinion is a major measure for protecting internet information security . "
although google did not accuse the chinese government of direct involvement in the attack , industry analyst paul craig told news agency afp that it could be a “ government-sponsored attack against individuals , or a commercially-sponsored attack . ”
“ typically the online criminal hacker is attempting to steal intellectual property , or financial information .
this does not seem to be the motive in this case , ” said craig , a leading security consultant for security-assessment.com , based in new zealand .
the " great firewall of china " chinese censors use two main methods of restricting access to web content . one is to block the ip addresses of websites they find problematic , including those of human rights organizations like amnesty international , or you tube .
users in china who try to access the sites are greeted with an error message , as though the site never existed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , google had cooperated with chinese authorities ' desire for censorship some users manage to get around the so-called " great firewall of china " through proxy servers , which route the information through an offsite server and in doing so assign the site a different ip address .
but chinese authorities often manage to block known hosts of proxy servers , meaning the holes allowing a view of the wider world web grow ever smaller .
the second form of internet censorship is more obvious - it makes the networks in china run much more slowly than in other parts of the world .
with the help of a filter , authorities can suppress or hide content they deem objectionable - such as pornography , foreign or independent media , or content associated with " controversial " topics such as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising - so that it is not accessible through other websites or search engines . foreign businesses are required to install such filters before being allowed to operate in china .
until tuesday , google had been among those that complied .
but google can not take the decision to abandon china lightly .
the company may not be able to afford the cost of giving up the world 's largest online market entirely . google has a 30 percent market share of china 's 360 million internet users , but chinese rival baidu controls about 60 percent of that market . svs / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 14.01.2010 green week opens under cloud of price-war pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food trade needs a fairness overhaul , one critic says price pressure is a topic at this year 's green week food and agriculture trade fair , which opens friday in berlin .
germany producers are feeling the pinch , and a way out seems hard to find . even as the world 's largest fair for food , agriculture and horticulture was set to open , more fuel was being poured onto the already heated debate over food prices and quality .
this week , a number of food discounters in germany - led by market leader aldi - continued an ongoing price war with yet another round of cuts , this time on items ranging from vegetable oil to breakfast cereal to snack chips .
there were 12 such major price reductions over the course of 2009 .
speaking at the fair , german agriculture minister ilse aigner said she was " very concerned " about what she saw as " acrimonious competition " as the discounters vied for market share .
" if pricing sets the rule in our country , then at some point the quality will suffer , and in the end , so will the consumer , " she said .
" society must know the value of high-quality and safe foods . "
earlier in the week , food industry association bve sharply criticized the " ruinous competition " in food production , and called for it to stop immediately .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ilse aigner says quality counts according to bve , discount markets account for 44 percent of the food sold in germany .
the green week comprises 1600 exhibitors from 56 countries .
two-thirds of those exhibitors come from germany , and the issue of food prices is a serious one for the country 's food industry as a whole .
with penny-pinching customers flocking to the discounters , help for food producers may have to come from outside the german borders , if at all .
spending less , getting the same amount germans only spend 11 percent of their income on food , according to industry statistics , and producers are feeling the pinch .
revenue in 2009 fell four percent from the previous year , food industry spokesman juergen abraham told deutsche welle , despite the fact that unit sales remained constant . " consumers have n't eaten less , but the food industry has had to adjust to a reduction in revenue .
it 's dramatic for the 5,800 companies and 530,000 workers who have suffered from the situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi is leading the price wars it is n't only the food industry , agricultural producers are also groaning about the problem .
prices of milk , butter and meat are as low as ever in germany , meaning they have to depend on exports .
currently , about a fifth of all meat and dairy products as well as 12 percent of sweets and packaged baked goods made in germany are sold outside of the country .
yet export numbers have been falling as well , dropping 5 percent from 2008 to 2009 .
" the financial and economic crisis has hit exports hard , since in many importing countries the currencies have crashed , " said gerd sonnleitner , president of the german farmers ' union -lrb- dbv -rrb- .
" for us in the agricultural sector it is very important to get the world economy going again . "
world food trade due for a rehaul ?
agricultural products " made in germany " have a good reputation both inside and outside of the country , sonnleitner said , but they are n't in the top price segment .
some 80 percent of german agricultural exports go to eu countries , while in industrial food production that number reaches 84 percent .
outside the eu , russia , switzerland and the us are the key importers of german foodstuffs .
now germans are hoping to improve their market share in emerging and developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices are hovering at low levels but what may save the german food industry may also be the death of the food industries in developing markets . the sale of cheap agricultural products from industrial countries is harmful for them , according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur for the right to food .
the trade in food throughout the world , he said , needs fundamental change .
" we all know that the current trading system does n't work to the advantage -lsb- of people in developing countries -rsb- , " he told deutsche welle , explaining that it hurts producers in poor countries who do n't have access to highly developed markets .
it also distorts competition in their own countries , because industrialized nations can offer highly subsidized , and cheap , foods .
the issue of milk powder for example , imported milk powder in a developing market can be less expensive than local milk .
in bangladesh , farmers recently protested , demanding a stop to milk powder imports .
but the farming association head sonnleitner rejects those arguments , saying it is mostly problems such as civil war , corruption , and a lack of civil rights that distort the marketplaces there .
" i always find it unfair that we are accused of destroying these countries with agricultural exports .
small sums of money and small amounts of foods are blown up out of proportion , " he said .
and as long as the german market remains difficult for food producers , there will be a strong incentive to look abroad for solutions .

germany producers are feeling the pinch , and a way out seems hard to find . even as the world 's largest fair for food , agriculture and horticulture was set to open , more fuel was being poured onto the already heated debate over food prices and quality .
this week , a number of food discounters in germany - led by market leader aldi - continued an ongoing price war with yet another round of cuts , this time on items ranging from vegetable oil to breakfast cereal to snack chips .
there were 12 such major price reductions over the course of 2009 .
speaking at the fair , german agriculture minister ilse aigner said she was " very concerned " about what she saw as " acrimonious competition " as the discounters vied for market share .
" if pricing sets the rule in our country , then at some point the quality will suffer , and in the end , so will the consumer , " she said .
" society must know the value of high-quality and safe foods . "
earlier in the week , food industry association bve sharply criticized the " ruinous competition " in food production , and called for it to stop immediately .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ilse aigner says quality counts according to bve , discount markets account for 44 percent of the food sold in germany .
the green week comprises 1600 exhibitors from 56 countries .
two-thirds of those exhibitors come from germany , and the issue of food prices is a serious one for the country 's food industry as a whole .
with penny-pinching customers flocking to the discounters , help for food producers may have to come from outside the german borders , if at all .
spending less , getting the same amount germans only spend 11 percent of their income on food , according to industry statistics , and producers are feeling the pinch .
revenue in 2009 fell four percent from the previous year , food industry spokesman juergen abraham told deutsche welle , despite the fact that unit sales remained constant . " consumers have n't eaten less , but the food industry has had to adjust to a reduction in revenue .
it 's dramatic for the 5,800 companies and 530,000 workers who have suffered from the situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi is leading the price wars it is n't only the food industry , agricultural producers are also groaning about the problem .
prices of milk , butter and meat are as low as ever in germany , meaning they have to depend on exports .
currently , about a fifth of all meat and dairy products as well as 12 percent of sweets and packaged baked goods made in germany are sold outside of the country .
yet export numbers have been falling as well , dropping 5 percent from 2008 to 2009 .
" the financial and economic crisis has hit exports hard , since in many importing countries the currencies have crashed , " said gerd sonnleitner , president of the german farmers ' union -lrb- dbv -rrb- .
" for us in the agricultural sector it is very important to get the world economy going again . "
world food trade due for a rehaul ?
agricultural products " made in germany " have a good reputation both inside and outside of the country , sonnleitner said , but they are n't in the top price segment .
some 80 percent of german agricultural exports go to eu countries , while in industrial food production that number reaches 84 percent .
outside the eu , russia , switzerland and the us are the key importers of german foodstuffs .
now germans are hoping to improve their market share in emerging and developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices are hovering at low levels but what may save the german food industry may also be the death of the food industries in developing markets . the sale of cheap agricultural products from industrial countries is harmful for them , according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur for the right to food .
the trade in food throughout the world , he said , needs fundamental change .
" we all know that the current trading system does n't work to the advantage -lsb- of people in developing countries -rsb- , " he told deutsche welle , explaining that it hurts producers in poor countries who do n't have access to highly developed markets .
it also distorts competition in their own countries , because industrialized nations can offer highly subsidized , and cheap , foods .
the issue of milk powder for example , imported milk powder in a developing market can be less expensive than local milk .
in bangladesh , farmers recently protested , demanding a stop to milk powder imports .
but the farming association head sonnleitner rejects those arguments , saying it is mostly problems such as civil war , corruption , and a lack of civil rights that distort the marketplaces there .
" i always find it unfair that we are accused of destroying these countries with agricultural exports .
small sums of money and small amounts of foods are blown up out of proportion , " he said .
and as long as the german market remains difficult for food producers , there will be a strong incentive to look abroad for solutions .

the focus of the investigation was on the prices for sweets , coffee and pet food .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 14.01.2010 even before deadly quake , haiti 's situation was dire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lives of many in haiti have been difficult for decades or longer at its founding haiti was a beacon of freedom , now it is the poorhouse of the western hemisphere .
even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .

" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .

vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

more than one million people are currently suffering from its after-effects .
why is it impossible to predict such a disaster ? experts at the earthquake research center in bensberg , near cologne , are currently analysing the data provided by tuesday 's vast earthquake , which so savagely hit the caribbean nation of haiti .
among them is professor klaus dieter hinzen , who said he is not at all surprised about the earthquake .
" in the past there have always been earthquakes along the whole archipelago in the caribbean , " he said , adding the last earthquakes struck haiti a long time ago .
" we know that there was a large quake in 1860 and that earlier , between 1750 and 1770 , the earth shook heavily there on three separate occasions . "
in order to understand why hinzen is not surprised haiti has been hit again , it is necessary to understand why earthquakes occur .
bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale earth 's surface consists of several different continental shelves which are in constant movement .
these shelves thrust against each other , forming borders like the st. andreas fault in california or one in anatolia .
because of this , certain areas in the world are particularly prone to earthquakes .
haiti is one such pace , although the last quake took place there more than 240 years ago .
haiti is on the caribbean shelf , which is sandwiched between the north and south american shelves , according to hinzen .
the country was hit particularly hard because none of the plates shifted over and under one another , but rather shifted side-by-side .
birger luehr of the german research center for geosciences in potsdam explained two sideways displacements along the western part of the fault – a northern and a southern one – form a shift of two centimeters -lrb- .79 inches -rrb- per year , which then becomes further divided .
latest measurements indicate a total movement of eight millimeters per year .
while that figure may not sound like much , it is multiplied by the 240 years since haiti 's last earthquake .
the result is a huge crack of two meters .
" the epicenter of the haiti earthquake was 10 kilometers deep and measured a seven on the richter scale , " luehr said .
" we can be fairly sure that the earth 's crust burst through to the surface , which is why the effects were so devastating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in haiti measured seven on the richter scale there are more than 300 seismographic measuring stations worldwide , but they can only measure an earthquake as it occurs .
scientists are n't capable of predicting the site , size or time of earthquakes , which left haiti without warning .
however , researchers are trying to become more precise about the probability of an earthquake , according to luehr .
" for one , we observe the activity of small micro-quakes which ca n't be felt but only measured with very sensitive instruments , " he said .
" we measure expansions underground or check the water levels in wells , because variations can take place there before a big quake .
we try to measure the electrical field of the earth , because in the past this has been observed to change before an earthquake .
still , none of these methods are true ways to predict an earthquake . "
according to luehr there was never a question if an earthquake would occur on haiti : the question was when .
and the fault is still emitting thousands of smaller earthquakes , which will continue for weeks or months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 14.01.2010 piracy on the high seas hits peak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates raised their game in 2009 a new report by the international maritime bureau has revealed that piracy rose to its highest level in six years in 2009 , but the eu anti-piracy operation atalanta prevented the rate from rising even further . pirate attacks around the world have more than tripled in 2009 according to the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- .
in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .
" all three work in coordination with each other , sharing information and resources , and i think all three work together equally , " mukundan said .
in the gulf of aden , 116 successful or attempted attacks took place , compared with 92 in 2008 .
large carriers were targeted most often .
" as of december 31 , suspected somali pirates were holding 12 vessels for ransom with 263 crew-members of various nationalities as hostages , " the imb report said .
not just somalis the report also pointed to a rise in the number of attacks in other areas , especially the south china seas , where there was the largest number of hijackings for five years .
on top of this , piracy around south america more than doubled in 2009 .
but attacks in the malacca strait , which was a world piracy hotspot just a few years ago , remained at just two in 2009 , the same as the previous year , the imb said. bk / afp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 13.01.2010 -rrb- somalia-based piracy remains an intractable problem it 's impossible to consider somalia 's pirates in a vacuum .

in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activities have moved to the indian ocean the eu 's atalanta operation is one of three big naval forces that currently patrol the area , the others being nato and the combined maritime forces , which include the uk and the us navies .
" all three work in coordination with each other , sharing information and resources , and i think all three work together equally , " mukundan said .
in the gulf of aden , 116 successful or attempted attacks took place , compared with 92 in 2008 .
large carriers were targeted most often .
" as of december 31 , suspected somali pirates were holding 12 vessels for ransom with 263 crew-members of various nationalities as hostages , " the imb report said .
not just somalis the report also pointed to a rise in the number of attacks in other areas , especially the south china seas , where there was the largest number of hijackings for five years .
on top of this , piracy around south america more than doubled in 2009 .
but attacks in the malacca strait , which was a world piracy hotspot just a few years ago , remained at just two in 2009 , the same as the previous year , the imb said. bk / afp / reuters / ap / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its annual report which was published on thursday , it said that suspected somali pirates account for more than half of the 406 reported incidents .
the news comes after germany announced it was sending a new ship , the emden , to the gulf of aden , the narrow channel between somalia and yemen , where piracy has been concentrated in recent years .
according to the imb , somali pirates ventured further out to sea last year to capture dozens of ships and collect millions of dollars in ransom .
a total of 1,052 crew members were taken hostage , 68 injured and eight killed in 2009 , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite some successes , piracy has continued to increase " pirates are now more desperate to hijack ships .
recent attacks , at distances of over 1,000 nautical miles from mogadishu , indicate the capability of the somali pirates , " the report added .
additional resources needed the report claimed that the european union 's anti-piracy operation atalanta , as well as the presence of us warships in the gulf of aden , prevented many more somali hijackings .
western patrols had forced pirates further south to somalia 's less-policed east coast .
but imb director , pottengal mukundan , made clear that this is no reason for complacency .
" our hope is that this escalating volume of piracy is met with a heightened response from the governments and their agencies best able to reduce and contain these risks to human life and property , " he said .
speaking to deutsche welle , mukundan said that atalanta had been extremely successful so far , but that more naval resources were needed in new areas .
" the gulf of aden is pretty well policed at the moment .
there was an extended period of several months when there were no hijackings there at all , " he said .
" but there are a lot of hijackings on the indian ocean side , and there is very little naval cover .
if countries can afford to send more ships , they are vitally needed . "
but mukundan stressed that resources should not be diverted from the gulf of aden to do this : " we need ships there to hold on to the progress we have made .
the situation in the indian ocean is new and very serious , and it needs to be managed with additional resources . "

a mix of sustainable energy sources and infrastructure connecting countries could reduce emissions . nearly a month after the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , european union ministers are meeting in seville to discuss the future of energy in europe .
an informal council meeting will focus on the european strategic energy technology plan and the european energy action plan for 2010-2014 , which addresses environmental sustainability along with the security of european energy supplies .
the meeting will continue through sunday and coincides with an informal meeting of the european ministers of energy and environment , to be held friday and saturday , also in seville .

hernandez garcia stated spain will work to diversify european energy sources and develop infrastructure connecting countries during the term of its european union presidency .
doing so may help avoid conflicts similar to those over gas , which have occurred between russia and the ukraine .
alternative energies analyzed by the european strategic energy technology plan include : solar , thermal-solar and photovoltaic and wind power on land and sea .
rainer hinrichs-rahlwes , vice president of the european renewable energies federation , said despite the copenhagen conference results ministers would do well to work on an agreement increasing the planned cut in european emissions from 20 to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
' it would certainly be sensible to reach an agreement within the european union very early on , ' he said . ' it must be made clear that we need to continue with higher goals than planned .
these goals can be reached with renewable energy sources . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.01.2010 as bundesliga re-starts , tussles at top and bottom mean plenty of drama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders leverkusen are being hunted by a closing pack german soccer 's winter break is over - hostilities resumed last weekend .
with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .
however podolski , who is in his second spell with the club after an unhappy time at bayern munich , may not be that sorely missed .
despite arriving back from bayern for 10 million euros , podolski has only hit the target once this season .
he 's not alone in goal-shyness , however .
cologne has only managed to score ten goals in the season 's first 17 matches .

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .
with just four wins from the first 17 matches , heiko herrlich 's side are in dire straits .
only their goal average is something to be positive about – they seem to be able to score one goal for every two they concede .
-lrb- it could be worse . -rrb-
with a trip to mid-table dullards borussia moenchengladbach planned for saturday , bochum may hope to reverse this current trend .
stuttgart , cologne totter nervously on the brink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian gross has restored confidence at vfb stuttgart will be hoping their recovery under new coach christian gross is not just a flash in the pre-break pan as they host reigning champions wolfsburg on saturday .
the wolves have been struggling of late so they could be there for stuttgart 's taking .
however , vfb are equal on points with bochum for a reason and the new dawn could be exposed as a false one should armin veh 's return to stuttgart be an unhappy one for his former team .
fc cologne take on fifth-placed dortmund on sunday with a little breathing space between them and the drop-zone .
but with dortmund enjoying something of a renaissance under coach juergen klopp , cologne could find their campaign resuming in a less than happy mood .
their concerns will not be eased by news that prodigal son lukas podolski could miss out as he overcomes a back problem .

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .
coach bruno labbadia is unlikely to have influential midfielder ze roberto -lrb- the elder -rrb- for the match , but at least he has him on the premises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's return will boost hamburg in the second half the brazilian , who is recovering from ankle surgery in november , missed the first nine days of hamburg 's pre-season training camp without giving an explanation , getting a fine for his troubles .
the mini-controversy is unlikely to disrupt hamburg 's resurgence , however , which has taken them to within four points of the top slot .
werder bremen , when they were last seen on the pitch in december , seemed to be going in the opposite direction .
thomas schaaf 's team tumbled down to sixth place before the break , seven points off the summit .
the " fish heads " will be looking to get back on track with a win in frankfurt on saturday when they take on mid-table eintracht .
relegation scrap reaches up to 12th place at the other end of the table , the relegation battle begins again in earnest with bottom-placed hertha berlin resuming their fight to avoid the drop against hanover 96 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel 's new recruits will seek to turn hertha 's season around hertha coach friedhelm funkel will be hoping that his new additions can help his team 's cause to climb out of the sub-basement .
greek striker theofanis gekas has joined on loan from leverkusen , levan kobiashvili is in from schalke and roman hubnik arrived in the capital on loan from fc moscow over the break .
with berlin staring down the barrel of seemingly certain relegation with only six points from 17 games , these new signings will have to make an immediate and dramatic impact to help save hertha .
nuremberg , six points ahead of berlin in the second-from-bottom slot , suffered four straight defeats before the break and face a tough task away to schalke this weekend .
new coach dieter hecking has also looked to bring in new personnel before the transfer window closes in a bid to escape the drop .
defender breno and midfielder andreas ottl , fringe players at bayern munich , have made their way to the club on loan in search of playing time , and rumor has it that mickael tavares , last seen deep down hamburg 's bench , may be ready to do the same .
bochum inhabit the relegation spot as the action restarts , and an uninspiring season to date suggests the notorious yo-yo club are ready for another trip down .

with the race for the title and top-flight survival still wide open , bundesliga fans are bracing themselves for an action-packed second half . the bundesliga begins again on friday – weather permitting – after a winter break which has seen envious glances from across europe directed in germany 's direction .
those countries without a mid-season pause might well be cursing the fact they do n't have a recess later in the year . matches postponed by snow and ice could pile up , bringing fixture congestion - and perhaps an overworked contingent of players heading to this summer 's world cup .
players in germany , however , could show up in south africa feeling refreshed due to their hibernation .
just how rested they may be will become evident on friday when the second half of the season kicks off with bayern munich taking on hoffenheim at the allianz arena .
bayern look to regain their familiar place - on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery , left , is out but robben may return for bayern bayern have the chance to go top for the first time since the end of the 2008 season with a win , but it could be short-lived . league leaders leverkusen host mainz on saturday , and a victory would be enough to return them to first place .
bayern , in third place on 33 points , are two behind the undefeated leaders and one point behind second-placed schalke .
bayern 's task has been made harder by the news that playmaker franck ribery will again be unavailable due to inflammation in his toes .
the frenchman , now fully recovered from a knee injury which has kept him out of training for two months , has played a full 90 minutes in just two matches this season , making an appearance in only nine of bayern 's 26 competitive games .
coach louis van gaal will be boosted , however , by reports that flying dutchman arjen robben 's twisted ankle , suffered in training , is not as bad as first thought and the winger is expected to play .
bayern ended the first half of the season strongly after an indifferent start and leverkusen and schalke , who play relegation-threatened nuremberg on sunday , will be looking nervously over their shoulders as the season 's final half begins .
four points separate top five teams in a bid to toughen-up his players for the final push towards a title bid , leverkusen coach jupp heynckes rejected such far-flung travel destinations as dubai during the winter break . he kept his players in snowy germany , grinding out training sessions in freezing temperatures .
the club , dubbed " never-kusen " due to its recurring habit of bottling it when involved in a championship struggle , will be hoping that an unbeaten first half of the season can be sustained , starting with three points against mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope the roof does n't fall in on their title dreams schalke , meanwhile , will be hoping that a 10-meter-long tear in the roof over the main stand at the veltins arena will not lead to their sunday game being postponed .
felix magath 's side will want to get their momentum going again after the break and introduce their several winter signings to the title fight as soon as possible .
the gelsenkirchen side have been the most active of the bundesliga teams in the transfer window , snapping up nuremburg midfielder peer kluge , bayern midfielder alexander baumjohann and brazilian striker edu from korean side suwon blue wings , as well as three more young players who are likely to start their schalke careers in the reserves .
moreover , schalke are also welcoming back ze roberto -lrb- the younger -rrb- . the attacking midfielder failed in his first stint in gelsenkirchen but he helped lead flamengo to the 2009 brazilian league title while on loan there , and magath has made no secret that he thinks the 29-year-old will make an impact this time around . fourth place hamburg will be looking to capitalize on potential slip-ups above them to march into the top three with victory over freiburg this weekend .

even before the earthquake , the country was wracked by conflict , political instability and environmental degradation . for many , the caribbean nation of haiti is the embodiment of the failed state , or maybe even an accursed one .
even before tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake that current estimates say killed tens of thousands , the country was reeling from a set of afflictions - both natural and man-made - that have turned the lives of many of its citizens into fights for survival more serious than they already were .
the independent research group fund for peace ranked haiti , which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic , number 12 in its 2009 list of failed states .
it based its tabulation on indicators such as severe economic decline , criminalization of the state , deterioration of public services , widespread violations of human rights and interventions by other nations in its internal affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and her daughters make clay cakes that ease hunger pains in a port-au-prince slum on a scale of one to 10 for these categories , with 10 being the worst , haiti scored 8.5 or higher . " life for the great majority of haitians , even before this catastrophe , was extremely difficult , " said sonya vogelberg of the german food-relief agency welthungerhilfe , who was a regional director in haiti from 2005 to 2007 .
" it was combination of political unrest , malnourishment and violence , especially in the overpopulated capital of port-au-prince , where many people in slums lived without any kind of infrastructure , " she told deutsche welle . some 80 percent of the haitian population live under the poverty line and just over half are categorized as living in abject poverty .
two-thirds of all haitians depend on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and are vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , the damage from which has been exacerbated by widespread deforestation across the country .
the nightmarish list of statistics grows longer still .
only 30 percent of haitians have access to sanitation ; 54 percent can access clean water .
the unemployment rate is around 70 percent and about half of the population is illiterate .
the average salary is 66 cents per day .
one of the capital 's slums , the notorious cite soleil , was once called by the united nations " the most dangerous place on earth . "
auspicious beginning while haiti has been beset with problems for much of its 200-year history , at the country 's outset , it was widely admired by those who supported the abolishment of the slave trade .
haiti , in fact , was the first " black " republic , the only nation born of a slave revolt .
christopher columbus landed on the shores of hipaniola in 1492 , and the native people there were all but wiped out by spanish settlers within 25 years .
in 1697 , spain ceded the western part of the island , now haiti , to france , which made it into the wealthiest colony in the caribbean due to thriving forestry and sugar industries , and the heavy importation of african slaves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slum in port-au-prince but in the late 18th century a slave rebellion under leader toussaint louverture was successful and after a long struggle , it became a republic on january 1 , 1804 .
" given the slave trade in north america , haiti was seen as a beacon of freedom in the new world , " stefan rinke , a professor in the latin america institute at berlin 's free university , told deutsche welle .
but the country gained its independence heavily indebted to france and since its former slaves originated in different parts of africa , there were many communities with different traditions , religions and social hierarchies which led to internal tensions , hindering development .
as well , democratic norms never really took hold , according to rinke .
jean-jacques dessalines , an ally of louverture and leader at the time of independence , soon ruled as a despot .
it was the beginning of a long and sad tradition of political leaders who felt their office gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wished , usually lining their own pockets along the way .
" government there is still dominated by the ' strong man ' principle , " said rinke terror and flight in the 20th century , the country was plunged into a new dark period with dictatorship of francois " papa doc " duvalier and his son , jean-claude , or " baby doc . "
for 29 years , they brutalized the country , killing tens of thousands of people .
it led to a massive brain drain as many of the country 's educated fled to the united states or , especially , french-speaking canada .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois " papa doc " duvalier " it was an enormous loss for the country , " said rinke .
" if all those people had not left , who knows what might have been possible . "
there were hopes that that the 1990 election of jean-bertrand aristide would signal a change in the country 's direction .
however , he was overthrown shortly thereafter and despite a us-led intervention in 1994 , experts still say haiti was plagued with extra-judicial killings , torture and brutality .
aristide eventually came back , but was forced out again , continuing the country 's tradition of putsch-based transfers of powers .
in its 200-year history , haiti has seen 32 coups .
natural disasters have also not spared the island .
in 2008 , the country was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes that killed 800 .
the scale of destruction , according to statements made at the time by world bank president robert zoellick , " makes your eyes pop . "
huge setback the tragedy of this latest , and likely more serious , catastrophe is that over the past few years , haiti had seemed to be stabilizing somewhat .
rene preval , an aristide ally , was elected president in 2006 and appeared to be ready to work toward long-term sustainable development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's severely damaged national palace former us president bill clinton was named by the un as special envoy to haiti and was using his talents to raising funds and public awareness .
last march , he raised $ 300 million -lrb- 207 million euros -rrb- for reconstruction efforts .
vogelberg of welthungerhilfe said when she left the country in 2007 , she felt the humanitarian situation was still serious , but she felt the country 's future was looking brighter .
" i had the feeling that things were getting better , " she said .
" after the elections , there was more life on the streets , haitians had begun celebrating carnival again and a certain joie de vivre was returning . "
but after the latest estimates of tens of thousands of deaths , the destruction of the headquarters of the un 's haiti program as well as the national palace , the country 's pride , she added : " now that has all been set back dramatically . "

consumer groups are calling for millions of euros in compensation . germany 's cartel office launched raids on major retail chains on thursday as part of an investigation into alleged price-fixing .
several of the country 's biggest supermarkets , chemists and pet supply stores were among those checked by the authorities .
the focus of the investigation was on the prices for sweets , coffee and pet food .
in total 24 companies are under suspicion of agreeing to set minimum prices for some of their items .
" the suspicions we had were based on several different ongoing investigations in the recent past , " said kay weidner , spokesperson of the cartel office . consumers " ripped off " consumer protection organizations have reacted by calling for compensation to be paid to consumers who had been " ripped off . "
" should these suspicions turn out to be true , then this will shatter consumers ' trust in our market economy , " said gerd billen of the german consumer protection group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supermarket lidl is one of those suspected of " ripping off " customers price-fixing is illegal in germany and authorities have warned of high fines should the suspicions be confirmed .
fines can be up to 10 percent of annual turnover .
in an earlier price-fixing scam over coffee , the three companies involved were fined a total of 160 million euros -lrb- $ 230 million -rrb- .
companies pledge to cooperate more than 100 police officers and officials were involved in the operation and companies checked included some of the sectors ' biggest names , such as metro , edeka , rewe or the discount supermarket lidl .
most of the companies involved have said they will support the investigations - as authorities have indicated that fines will be lower for those who cooperate with the police .
traditionally , retailers agree terms with their suppliers at annual meetings .
authorities suspect that they also agreed illegally what the minimum retail prices should be for certain brand products .
the price fixing scandal comes at a time when german supermarkets are locked in a price war , with discount supermarket aldi announcing on thursday that it would lower prices by up to 23 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 14.01.2010 green week opens under cloud of price-war pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world food trade needs a fairness overhaul , one critic says price pressure is a topic at this year 's green week food and agriculture trade fair , which opens friday in berlin .
germany producers are feeling the pinch , and a way out seems hard to find . even as the world 's largest fair for food , agriculture and horticulture was set to open , more fuel was being poured onto the already heated debate over food prices and quality .
this week , a number of food discounters in germany - led by market leader aldi - continued an ongoing price war with yet another round of cuts , this time on items ranging from vegetable oil to breakfast cereal to snack chips .
there were 12 such major price reductions over the course of 2009 .
speaking at the fair , german agriculture minister ilse aigner said she was " very concerned " about what she saw as " acrimonious competition " as the discounters vied for market share .
" if pricing sets the rule in our country , then at some point the quality will suffer , and in the end , so will the consumer , " she said .
" society must know the value of high-quality and safe foods . "
earlier in the week , food industry association bve sharply criticized the " ruinous competition " in food production , and called for it to stop immediately .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ilse aigner says quality counts according to bve , discount markets account for 44 percent of the food sold in germany .
the green week comprises 1600 exhibitors from 56 countries .
two-thirds of those exhibitors come from germany , and the issue of food prices is a serious one for the country 's food industry as a whole .
with penny-pinching customers flocking to the discounters , help for food producers may have to come from outside the german borders , if at all .
spending less , getting the same amount germans only spend 11 percent of their income on food , according to industry statistics , and producers are feeling the pinch .
revenue in 2009 fell four percent from the previous year , food industry spokesman juergen abraham told deutsche welle , despite the fact that unit sales remained constant . " consumers have n't eaten less , but the food industry has had to adjust to a reduction in revenue .
it 's dramatic for the 5,800 companies and 530,000 workers who have suffered from the situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi is leading the price wars it is n't only the food industry , agricultural producers are also groaning about the problem .
prices of milk , butter and meat are as low as ever in germany , meaning they have to depend on exports .
currently , about a fifth of all meat and dairy products as well as 12 percent of sweets and packaged baked goods made in germany are sold outside of the country .
yet export numbers have been falling as well , dropping 5 percent from 2008 to 2009 .
" the financial and economic crisis has hit exports hard , since in many importing countries the currencies have crashed , " said gerd sonnleitner , president of the german farmers ' union -lrb- dbv -rrb- .
" for us in the agricultural sector it is very important to get the world economy going again . "
world food trade due for a rehaul ?
agricultural products " made in germany " have a good reputation both inside and outside of the country , sonnleitner said , but they are n't in the top price segment .
some 80 percent of german agricultural exports go to eu countries , while in industrial food production that number reaches 84 percent .
outside the eu , russia , switzerland and the us are the key importers of german foodstuffs .
now germans are hoping to improve their market share in emerging and developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices are hovering at low levels but what may save the german food industry may also be the death of the food industries in developing markets . the sale of cheap agricultural products from industrial countries is harmful for them , according to olivier de schutter , the un special rapporteur for the right to food .
the trade in food throughout the world , he said , needs fundamental change .
" we all know that the current trading system does n't work to the advantage -lsb- of people in developing countries -rsb- , " he told deutsche welle , explaining that it hurts producers in poor countries who do n't have access to highly developed markets .
it also distorts competition in their own countries , because industrialized nations can offer highly subsidized , and cheap , foods .
the issue of milk powder for example , imported milk powder in a developing market can be less expensive than local milk .
in bangladesh , farmers recently protested , demanding a stop to milk powder imports .
but the farming association head sonnleitner rejects those arguments , saying it is mostly problems such as civil war , corruption , and a lack of civil rights that distort the marketplaces there .
" i always find it unfair that we are accused of destroying these countries with agricultural exports .
small sums of money and small amounts of foods are blown up out of proportion , " he said .
and as long as the german market remains difficult for food producers , there will be a strong incentive to look abroad for solutions .

consumer groups are calling for millions of euros in compensation . germany 's cartel office launched raids on major retail chains on thursday as part of an investigation into alleged price-fixing .
several of the country 's biggest supermarkets , chemists and pet supply stores were among those checked by the authorities .
the focus of the investigation was on the prices for sweets , coffee and pet food .
in total 24 companies are under suspicion of agreeing to set minimum prices for some of their items .
" the suspicions we had were based on several different ongoing investigations in the recent past , " said kay weidner , spokesperson of the cartel office . consumers " ripped off " consumer protection organizations have reacted by calling for compensation to be paid to consumers who had been " ripped off . "
" should these suspicions turn out to be true , then this will shatter consumers ' trust in our market economy , " said gerd billen of the german consumer protection group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supermarket lidl is one of those suspected of " ripping off " customers price-fixing is illegal in germany and authorities have warned of high fines should the suspicions be confirmed .
fines can be up to 10 percent of annual turnover .
in an earlier price-fixing scam over coffee , the three companies involved were fined a total of 160 million euros -lrb- $ 230 million -rrb- .
companies pledge to cooperate more than 100 police officers and officials were involved in the operation and companies checked included some of the sectors ' biggest names , such as metro , edeka , rewe or the discount supermarket lidl .
most of the companies involved have said they will support the investigations - as authorities have indicated that fines will be lower for those who cooperate with the police .
traditionally , retailers agree terms with their suppliers at annual meetings .
authorities suspect that they also agreed illegally what the minimum retail prices should be for certain brand products .
the price fixing scandal comes at a time when german supermarkets are locked in a price war , with discount supermarket aldi announcing on thursday that it would lower prices by up to 23 percent .
competitors have already announced they will follow suit. ai / dpa / reuters / apd editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .

according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .
" one of the features will be an outside mural , a street art activity , in which a huge space will be created where we want to support all sorts of creativity by young people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .

the city has launched a year of celebrations , including a new museum and a 3d movie . born to a polish mother and a french father in 1810 in the village of zelazowa wola near warsaw , frederic chopin spent his most of this youth in the polish capital .
in 1830 he left for france , where he lived till his death at the age of 40 .
among chopin 's most popular works are his mazurkas , based on national polish folklore , piano concertos , and nocturnes . the polish characteristics in chopin 's music are associated with the fact that he lived at a time when poland did not exist as a state , explained musicologist monika strugala , who is also the project coordinator for the chopin year 2010 . poland had been partitioned by neighboring russia , austria and prussia in the late 18th century and culture was one way of preserving the polish national spirit . " chopin left poland without knowing that he would never come back .
he was very nostalgic .
he remembered his childhood sites , where he was born and where he went on holiday .
you can hear all that in his music , " said strugala . the asian connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang lang says chopin 's music works well with animation a year-long season commemorating the 200th anniversary of chopin 's birth was officially launched earlier this month with a gala concert at the warsaw philharmonic featuring 27-year-old chinese pianist lang lang .
according to polish musicologists , the choice of the artist was not accidental as chopin is known to have the greatest following in asia . " the composer 's nostalgia and the visual qualities of his music seem to appeal to japanese and chinese audiences , " said strugala .
" they evoke images of one form of traditional japanese paintings that shows the world in much the same gentle way . " a birthday mystery among the highlights of chopin year in poland is a series of concerts between february 22 and march 1 , the two possible dates of the composer 's birth .
such world-famous pianists as martha argerich , garrick ohlsson and krystian zimerman are billed to appear . " february used to be commonly accepted -lsb- as chopin 's birth month -rsb- , but musicologists recently discovered that in letters to his mother chopin regularly mentioned march 1 as his birthday , " explained alicja knast , curator of warsaw 's new chopin museum says .
" chopin was a genius , so why should n't he have two birthdays ?
besides , each composer should have some mystery about them . " until recently visitors to warsaw had little chance to find out more about the composer , as the city 's chopin museum was cramped in the space of just three tiny rooms .
but on march 1 a new multimedia museum is to be inaugurated . multimedia museum the new exhibition incorporates both visual and audio content , including soundscapes and an audio narrative based on chopin letters . " we want visitors to experience chopin by bridging the gap between the past and the present , " said knast .
" one of the features will be an outside mural , a street art activity , in which a huge space will be created where we want to support all sorts of creativity by young people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chopin monument in warsaw 's lazienki park when they 're given the chance to be creative , young people are more likely to participate , added the curator . chopin fans can look forward to two other highlights later in the year .
a festival called " chopin and his europe " will be held in august and the three-week international piano chopin competition - where 100 pianists perform only works by chopin - takes place in october . chopin in 3d in one of poland 's leading film studios in the city of lodz , an international crew is busy shooting a 3d co-production set to chopin 's music .
" the flying machine " is being made by the uk 's breahthru films , the makers of academy award-winning " peter and the wolf , " and poland 's se-ma-for studio . the music in the film is played by lang lang , who finds the combination of a cartoon with chopin 's piano harmonies very appropriate . " i started watching ' tom and jerry ' to get into classical music and to get into piano playing , " he said , tongue-in-cheek .
" cartoon , animation and music is always connected so closely , you can not find a better context to put music and animation together .

in pakistan in 2009 , there were 48 registered cases .
only a third of acid attack victims are officially reported , estimates the acid survivors foundation , a non-governmental organisation .
a new domestic violence draft law to stop these attacks is currently under review in the pakistani parliament . naila farhat was 13 when she became the victim of a heinous crime - an acid attack .
her schoolteacher wanted her to marry his friend .
she and her family had made the “ mistake ” of saying they did not want her to get married so early .
" i was coming back from school that day , ” naila remembers .
“ my schoolteacher and his friend crossed my path and asked me to go along with them .
when i refused my teacher held me tight and his friend threw acid in my face . "
naila ’ s attacker was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages .
however , he appealed to the high court , which reduced the sentence saying the man could go free after paying a reduced amount of money .
naila then appealed to the supreme court that overturned the high court ’ s decision within minutes and the attacker was jailed again .
however , naila is still not entirely satisfied .
" i am grateful to god that i got justice , ” she says , “ but i am not happy that my teacher who was equally responsible for the crime was not punished .
i hope he is also punished for his crime . "
two-thirds of attacked women do not file complaints not all women in pakistan are like naila , who fought for six years to punish her attackers .
sana masood , the legal coordinator of the acid survivors foundation in islamabad says that around 68 percent of attacked women do not file a complaint .
in pakistan , especially in conservative and poor rural areas , many men treat women as commodities .
women have little protection from the police and are under pressure not to disgrace their families .
" the main problem is the social stigma attached to going to a police station and to a court , ” explains masood because in our society a lot of people think that going to the court is not a classy thing . "
sale of acid has to be regulated a draft law on domestic violence is currently being debated in the pakistani parliament but masood says other measures are also necessary to curb the rise in acid attacks .
" what we need to do is to regulate the sale and purchase of acid that should not be easily accessible to the general public . "
industrial strength acid usually used in cotton processing is often used in such attacks because it is so cheap and anyone can buy it for just a few cents .
naila , too , is from the cotton industry belt in punjab province where these chemicals are easily available .
there are many others who have been attacked but naila is an example of somebody who has shown how women can appeal to the courts and get justice .
campaigners say the case has raised a lot of awareness among all pakistanis , compelling the government to think about giving proper legal support to the victims of acid attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 14.01.2010 german lawyer represents khmer rouge victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silke studzinsky has been representing the civil parties at the un-backed genocide tribunal since 2008 roughly two million people - a fifth of the entire cambodian population - died during the khmer rouge ’ s terror regime .
30 years later , the legal reckoning has only just begun .
the hearing of the first accused , duch - the head of the infamous s21 prison and torture centre - recently came to an end .
the sentence is expected to be handed down within a few months .
thomas bärthlein spoke to a german lawyer who has been representing the khmer rouge victims in court . in 2008 , the german development service sent berlin lawyer silke studzinsky to phnom penh as part of the civilian peace service programme .
since then , it has been her task to represent the civil parties - the victims - at the un-backed genocide tribunal .
studzinsky has already achieved a great deal .
without her , the fact that the khmer rouge systematically used sexual violence would have remained in the dark .
the fact that they forced people to marry en masse , for example , has been overshadowed by the sheer scale of murder and torture .
“ the general perception is that the khmer rouge murdered and tortured , ” explained silke studzinsky , “ but that they punished sexual violence , when it occurred , very strictly because they were puritanical .
male historians have perpetuated this perception . ”
although silke studzinsky had little experience of cambodia before arriving , she had already done a lot of work on sexual violence .
“ people would mention before , almost in passing , that they had been forced to marry , ” she said .
“ but nobody asked any probing questions !
such as ‚ what does forced mean ? ’
were you ordered to have sex ?
what was the point ?
and if no questions are asked then no answers are given , especially not with this kind of topic . “ this little-known aspect of the khmer rouge era was examined at the end of duch ’ s trial .
many cambodians see themselves as victims silke studzinsky confirmed that the trial had come as a great relief to the victims who were able to speak out against duch .
but she was also critical of cambodia ’ s way of dealing with the past .
“ here everyone tends to think of themselves as victims .
and the young generation has not really questioned this role of the victim .
the idea is that that pol pot controlled everything and everyone else had to follow , otherwise they themselves would have been killed .
the great majority of those who were alive at the time have taken refuge in this role of the victim . ”
duch himself used this as his defence , saying he had no choice .
moreover , his lawyers alleged that the prosecution had made random choices .
they also said that duch was a scapegoat and that other , much worse , criminals remained at large .
“ no equality in injustice ” silke studzinsky agreed that the list of the accused is incomplete but said duch could not use this to talk his way out .
“ there is no equality in injustice .
this line of defence - that other prison heads should be on the accused bench before him according to a kind of ranking of how many victims died where - that his national lawyers in particular are using has no foundation . ”
hearings against four more accused are expected to take place in 2011 .
trials for five other khmer rouge leaders who have not yet been named are also probable .
they are likely to be summoned and arrested in the near future , said studzinsky who will continue to represent the victims of the khmer rouge in court .
she recently extended her contract until the end of 2010 .
