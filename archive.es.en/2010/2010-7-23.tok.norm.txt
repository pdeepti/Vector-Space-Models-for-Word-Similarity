the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .
there is nothing they could do more , says carl thayer , an expert on the southeast asian affairs at the australian defense force academy . " the asean regional forum can take no position that is compulsory on all members .
and asean individual states feel it -lrb- cheonan -rrb- is a bilateral issue and they usually abhor using force and threats that they see the us is applying . " delegates also discussed myanmar 's political process and human rights situation . according to janos martonyi , the hungarian foreign minister , myanmar is at a crossroads .
he called on the country to hold fair elections and release political prisoners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean foreign minister park ui chun myanmar and south china sea the us , on the other hand also raised concerns over myanmar 's alleged nuclear activities .
on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .
observers believe this , however , is unlikely . " in 2002 they negotiated a very weak declaration on the conduct of parties .
and that initial document was supposed to be the first step towards a code of conduct .
from 2002 to 2010 , it is eight years , we have n't proceeded .
so i do n't see a prospect of a binding code of conduct anytime soon , " says thayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south china sea islands are believed to be rich in resources influence of the us and china over the years china has become an important participant at the arf meetings .
so has the us .
thayer says the focus of us diplomacy is shifting .
under bush the us administration concentrated more on the global war on terror .
now the obama administration is showing a greater commitment to southeastern asia in response to the chinese challenge . " i think during the bush administration , china made great inroads using soft diplomacy and now the us is playing a multilateral game and that is music to asean ’ s ears , " says thayer .
" asean wants the each super power to come to it rather than the superpowers impacting it . " to enhance its partnerships and bilateral ties , the us is planning to hold a summit for southeast asian leaders in washington later this year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but criticism of germany 's economic model is growing louder as experts call on germans to stimulate domestic demand . until recently , german exports were suffering due to the economic crisis , but those days are nearly forgotten , and exports are taking off again .
statistics showed that the country 's exports recovered twice as much as expected in may .
goods worth 77.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- left germany 's borders , which represents an increase of nearly 30 percent compared to last year . " germany 's export model is functioning very well , " michael heise , chief economist at the allianz group said . heise added that the companies that rely on industrial exports , as many in germany do , often suffer worst during an economic downturn . " that 's what explains last year 's drop of 5 percent , which was much higher than in other countries , " he said , adding that when the economy is doing well , it translates to above average growth for german exporters . non-eu exports growing fastest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial exports that get hit hard in tough times tend to bounce back faster exports to outside of europe , with china , india and brazil leading the way , have been increasing twice as much as exports headed to european nations .
that has some in europe concerned since germany 's trade surpluses are creating deficits for its neighbors . french finance minister christine lagarde has said germany 's trade surpluses are due to the minimal salary hikes its workers get and can not be maintained over the long term .
similar statements have come from the united states , which would like to see germany do more to boost demand and cut its budget less . it 's a criticism heise said he can understand . " it 's essential that we increase domestic economic activity and demand in germany , " he said .
" that 's what foreign countries are demanding as our part in eliminating imbalances - and we 're going to have to show some that we 're doing something . " who has to change most ? the disagreement focuses on whether only southern europe 's less competitive nations have to change their policies or if well-off nations like germany should also do more to contribute to bringing economic balance back to europe .
even as the euro grows stronger against the dollar , germany was able to step up its exports between 2000 and 2008 by 65 percent .
that was largely because wages lagged behind productivity , which equated to a real devaluation for germans and kept up the country 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : views differ on which countries have to take measures to help the whole of europe now , with exports rising again , the united states has said germany , as well as other european nations , should foster the fledgling recovery with stimulus measures rather than slashing public spending .
but germany 's government has insisted it will not introduce new economic stimulus packages . " the strategy can not be that we start taking on more national debts and artificially expand state consumption , " heise said .
" we have to stimulate private consumption and investment demand . " he added that changing labor and employment policies , modifying the tax system and limiting bureaucracy would all contribute to evening out trade imbalances .
but there are also more radical measures being considered , some of which call for germany to give up some of its ability to compete . more german than the germans " it is absurd that germans advise their neighbors to copy german traits , " said martin wolf , chief economist at the financial times , adding that it would make more sense for germans to take on debt , boost pay and become more european . competitiveness is generally measured by unit labor costs .
the european statistics office indexed these costs using the year 2000 as its base .
nine years later , the index gives southern european nations a value of about 130 , france scored 118 and germany at 105 ; showing that most european countries have lost the fight for competitiveness to germany . and germany does not see any reason to turn back the clock on gains it has made .

that has some in europe concerned since germany 's trade surpluses are creating deficits for its neighbors . french finance minister christine lagarde has said germany 's trade surpluses are due to the minimal salary hikes its workers get and can not be maintained over the long term .
similar statements have come from the united states , which would like to see germany do more to boost demand and cut its budget less . it 's a criticism heise said he can understand . " it 's essential that we increase domestic economic activity and demand in germany , " he said .
" that 's what foreign countries are demanding as our part in eliminating imbalances - and we 're going to have to show some that we 're doing something . " who has to change most ? the disagreement focuses on whether only southern europe 's less competitive nations have to change their policies or if well-off nations like germany should also do more to contribute to bringing economic balance back to europe .
even as the euro grows stronger against the dollar , germany was able to step up its exports between 2000 and 2008 by 65 percent .
that was largely because wages lagged behind productivity , which equated to a real devaluation for germans and kept up the country 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : views differ on which countries have to take measures to help the whole of europe now , with exports rising again , the united states has said germany , as well as other european nations , should foster the fledgling recovery with stimulus measures rather than slashing public spending .
but germany 's government has insisted it will not introduce new economic stimulus packages . " the strategy can not be that we start taking on more national debts and artificially expand state consumption , " heise said .
" we have to stimulate private consumption and investment demand . " he added that changing labor and employment policies , modifying the tax system and limiting bureaucracy would all contribute to evening out trade imbalances .
but there are also more radical measures being considered , some of which call for germany to give up some of its ability to compete . more german than the germans " it is absurd that germans advise their neighbors to copy german traits , " said martin wolf , chief economist at the financial times , adding that it would make more sense for germans to take on debt , boost pay and become more european . competitiveness is generally measured by unit labor costs .
the european statistics office indexed these costs using the year 2000 as its base .
nine years later , the index gives southern european nations a value of about 130 , france scored 118 and germany at 105 ; showing that most european countries have lost the fight for competitiveness to germany . and germany does not see any reason to turn back the clock on gains it has made . " we are not going to give up our strengths , " chancellor angela merkel said .
" that would be the wrong answer for our continent . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .

five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

this year it seems especially bad .
the affected area is almost the size of germany and even visible from outer space .
it appears like a gigantic foul-smelling carpet , 377 000 square kilometers in size , spreading from finland to the german-polish border and to the island of ruegen .
it is the biggest algae explosion since 2005 .
a combination of farming and weather bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wwf says current conditions are ' perfect ' for algae growth it 's not just the sunny weather which is driving the bloom .
it 's also the large quantity of phosphorus in the water .
" over-fertilization is the biggest environmental problem facing the baltic , " said jochen lamp from the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in hamburg .
the phosphates are being washed off farmland and from rivers into the baltic sea .
wwf has criticized countries bordering on the baltic for their disjointed response to the problem .
on the one hand they seem eager to reduce over-fertilization , on the other they encourage farmers to use more fertilizers .
sweden for example has abolished its tax on fertilizers and in the north-eastern part of germany , in mecklenburg-western pomerania , farmers are now allowed to manure their land within a meter of dikes and creeks - it used to be seven meters .
algae cause death zones in the water algae blooms can be disastrous for ecoystems , causing dead zones under water .
they suck up the oxygen , leaving none for plants and animals .
" this is especially bad for fish , crawfish , starfish and crabs living in the ground .
their lives are severely affected and in the worst case they die , " says wera leujak , specialist for oceanic security at the german federal environment agency .
the baltic sea already has quite a number of these dead zones , but the algae exacerbate them .
for humans , the blue-green algae are unhealthy as well .
they can cause skin rashes , allergic reactions or diarrhoea and damage the liver .
bildunterschrift : the blue-green algae bloom can even be seen from space clear water , clear samples yet despite a media uproar in europe this week , the situation is not that much worse than normal .
on thursday , a research ship took water samples from the baltic sea on the west coast of ruegen .
" at least for this area , we can give the all-clear , " said harald stegemann , head of the state environmental office for mecklenburg-western pomerania in guestrow , who initiated the operation .
" the samples looked like tap water and the colleagues on board did n't see any algae carpets , although we expected it to be different . "
on other parts of the baltic sea algae are visible .
" there are these tiny little algae floating around and colouring the water green and yellowish , " said thomas merck .
he works on the small island of vilm near ruegen and has lived there for a couple of years now .
" speaking from experience , all i can say is : it just happens regularly . "
algae comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , beaches have stayed open - with a bit of rain the algae may even disappear .
for this reason , local scientists are reluctant to join the hysteria .
of course the area looks huge on satellite images .
" but the important question is : is it just a film of two or three millimeters or is it a real carpet of two or three centimeters ? "
stegemann explains .
for him , it does not seem to be very dramatic , though he concedes that sufficient data has not yet been gathered to dismiss the problem out of hand .
in any event , the carpet may well disappear during the next few days anyway : " if it cools down , if it gets stormy , if it rains , the water will intermingle and it 's all over , " stegemann said .

the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .
there is nothing they could do more , says carl thayer , an expert on the southeast asian affairs at the australian defense force academy . " the asean regional forum can take no position that is compulsory on all members .
and asean individual states feel it -lrb- cheonan -rrb- is a bilateral issue and they usually abhor using force and threats that they see the us is applying . " delegates also discussed myanmar 's political process and human rights situation . according to janos martonyi , the hungarian foreign minister , myanmar is at a crossroads .
he called on the country to hold fair elections and release political prisoners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean foreign minister park ui chun myanmar and south china sea the us , on the other hand also raised concerns over myanmar 's alleged nuclear activities .
on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .
observers believe this , however , is unlikely . " in 2002 they negotiated a very weak declaration on the conduct of parties .
and that initial document was supposed to be the first step towards a code of conduct .
from 2002 to 2010 , it is eight years , we have n't proceeded .
so i do n't see a prospect of a binding code of conduct anytime soon , " says thayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south china sea islands are believed to be rich in resources influence of the us and china over the years china has become an important participant at the arf meetings .
so has the us .
thayer says the focus of us diplomacy is shifting .
under bush the us administration concentrated more on the global war on terror .
now the obama administration is showing a greater commitment to southeastern asia in response to the chinese challenge . " i think during the bush administration , china made great inroads using soft diplomacy and now the us is playing a multilateral game and that is music to asean ’ s ears , " says thayer .
" asean wants the each super power to come to it rather than the superpowers impacting it . " to enhance its partnerships and bilateral ties , the us is planning to hold a summit for southeast asian leaders in washington later this year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .

the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 23.07.2010 oil company fined over ivory coast toxic dump großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura concealed the harmful nature of the waste , the court found a dutch court has fined oil firm trafigura one million euros for violating european laws on the export of waste , four years after the company dumped toxic waste meant to remain in amsterdam in ivory coast . swiss-based oil company trafigura was fined one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- on friday by an amsterdam court for violating eu laws on the export of hazardous waste , which the un says killed at least 15 people and forced thousands to be hospitalized in 2006 .
the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

the call comes as the oil spill in the gulf of mexico near its 15th week . with the bp oil spill fiasco in the gulf of mexico entering its fourth month , germany 's environment minister , norbert roettgen , has called for a moratorium on new oil drilling in the north sea .
roettgen said the measure should be taken until an investigation can determine exactly what went wrong in the oil rig explosion that led to the spill off the united states coast , which has become the country 's worst-ever environmental disaster .
" we take risks , but we ca n't take every risk , " roettgen told public broadcaster zdf .
" without safety there can be no drilling . "
roettgen said , however , he doubted that other north sea countries would go along with a moratorium .
he added that environmental and safety standards applied to north sea drilling operations differed from those used in the united states .
countries straddling the north sea include norway , denmark , the netherlands , belgium , france , britain and germany .
the calls by the german environment minister come two weeks after european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger called for a halt on deep sea drilling - a demand that was rebuffed by a number of eu states , including the uk .
individual eu member states are responsible for approving or rejecting drilling proposals in their own waters .

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

while the us senate is investigating , experts are n't surprised . the senators were incensed .
in an open letter to the us secretary of state on july 13 , four democratic lawmakers urged hillary clinton to fully investigate reports about a possible link between bp and the release of the convicted lockerbie bomber by the british government .
" the question we now have to answer is , was this corporation willing to trade justice in the murder of 270 innocent people for oil profits ? " the senators ask in their letter .
on july 29 , the senate foreign relations committee will convene a hearing on the issue . at the heart of the case is abdelbaset al-megrahi , a libyan national who was convicted of blowing up pan am flight 103 in 1988 over the scottish village of lockerbie .
270 people , including 189 americans , were killed in the downing of the airliner .
al-megrahi was released in august last year on compassionate grounds because he was diagnosed with a terminal illness .
his release and the subsequent hero 's welcome he received in libya caused a public outcry in the us .
bp lobbied for a prisoner deal , not for al-megrahi two days after the senators ' letter was published , bp admitted that it had in fact lobbied the british government in 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with libya because it was concerned a slow resolution would impact an offshore drilling deal with libya .
the prisoner deal was ultimately agreed upon by the british government in 2007 , the same year bp reached an exploration deal worth 900 million dollars with libya .
while bp admitted lobbying for the prisoner deal , it said it was not involved in discussions about the freeing of al-megrahi .
" the decision to release al-megrahi in august 2009 was taken by the scottish government , " bp said in a statement on july 15 " it is not for bp to comment on the decision of the scottish government .
bp was not involved in any such discussions about the release of al-megrahi . "
according to the oil company 's statement , " bp told the uk government that we were concerned about the slow progress that was being made in concluding a prisoner transfer agreement with libya . "
" we were aware that this could have a negative impact on uk commercial interests , including the ratification by the libyan government of bp 's exploration agreement , " the statement read .
lobbying power house asked whether he was surprised about bp 's admitted lobbying for a controversial prisoner release deal with libya , thomas seifert , who wrote an acclaimed book on the oil industry and works as foreign affairs editor at the austrian daily " die presse " , is unequivocal : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelbaset al-megrahi was welcomed in tripoli by the libyan leader 's son , seif al-islam gadhafi " no , not at all , " he said .
" it 's about a 900 million dollar deal in libya and that 's why bp lobbied .
and that 's not a crime , and of course they can do that .
we all can lobby our governments for better schools and universities or things like that .
but of course it helps quite a bit if you have the firepower of multi-billion dollar companies to pay lobbyists who have gone the revolving door in and out of governments and have a pretty good network in the governments . "
dave levinthal , communications director with the center for responsive politics in washington , which runs the lobbying clearinghouse opensecrets.org , put the current case of bp 's lobbying for a prisoner deal in a larger context : " certainly what we see in the united states is that bp , particularly in recent years , has really spent a considerable amount of money on lobbying efforts and lobbying federal level politicians in the united states .
so it does serve to reason that they would be doing similar things , be it in britain or otherwise in europe when it comes to political lobbying . "
according to levinthal , bp spent more than 15 million dollars last year alone for lobbying the us federal government .
that ranks the company fourth among all oil and gas related corporations in terms of lobbying expenditure .
only exxonmobil , chevron , conocophilips spent more money lobbying the us government than bp .
" it 's important to note that they have a small army of lobbyists , " said levinthal .
they have literally dozens of people who lobby on their behalf and when you consider just that mere fact , they have a lot of resources to draw from . "
friends lobbying friends but perhaps even more important than the sheer amount of money poured into lobbying is the cadre of people bp hires to do the job .
" when you go a little bit deeper you notice that many of the people bp has hired as lobbyists are actually former government officials , " said levinthal .
" they are in some cases former federal level staffers , they are former congressional staffers , in some cases they are even former members of congress . "
bildunterschrift : last month , bp ceo tony hayward had to testify on capitol hill about the oil spill in the gulf of mexico for companies like bp it makes perfect sense to hire people who know the political system .
" these are people who have worked in the government , these are people who have friends in the government " , said levinthal .
" and just like if you wanted to try to convince your friend to do something , you probably have a much better chance of convincing your friend to do what you want than a perfect stranger . "
details of lobbying usually do n't become public apparently that is also how bp lobbied the british government over the prisoner transfer deal .
according to the " wall street journal , " bp told the paper that a special adviser to bp who had previously worked for the british intelligence service mi6 had raised the prisoner transfer agreement , but not the specific case of al mehgrahi , with then-justice secretary jack straw .
although it is easy to single out bp for criticism for their lobbying practices , that 's not really fair , notes thomas seifert : " if you have a certain size of an industry or of a company then basically the interest of this company might coincide with the interest of this country .
we are talking about thousands of jobs ; we are talking about providing the energy infrastructure , providing the lifeblood of our whole industrial system , so it 's pretty significant . "
what 's more , adds seifert , most other international energy companies are also engaged in lobbying all over the world to get access to oil and gas reserves .
however , what is unusual about the bp case is not necessarily the lobbying efforts themselves , but the fact that this kind of detailed information has become public .
perhaps the senators will unearth even more aspects of bp 's efforts to influence the british government in their hearing on the case .

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .

" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .

" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .

" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .
there is nothing they could do more , says carl thayer , an expert on the southeast asian affairs at the australian defense force academy . " the asean regional forum can take no position that is compulsory on all members .
and asean individual states feel it -lrb- cheonan -rrb- is a bilateral issue and they usually abhor using force and threats that they see the us is applying . " delegates also discussed myanmar 's political process and human rights situation . according to janos martonyi , the hungarian foreign minister , myanmar is at a crossroads .
he called on the country to hold fair elections and release political prisoners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean foreign minister park ui chun myanmar and south china sea the us , on the other hand also raised concerns over myanmar 's alleged nuclear activities .
on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .
observers believe this , however , is unlikely . " in 2002 they negotiated a very weak declaration on the conduct of parties .
and that initial document was supposed to be the first step towards a code of conduct .
from 2002 to 2010 , it is eight years , we have n't proceeded .
so i do n't see a prospect of a binding code of conduct anytime soon , " says thayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south china sea islands are believed to be rich in resources influence of the us and china over the years china has become an important participant at the arf meetings .
so has the us .
thayer says the focus of us diplomacy is shifting .
under bush the us administration concentrated more on the global war on terror .
now the obama administration is showing a greater commitment to southeastern asia in response to the chinese challenge . " i think during the bush administration , china made great inroads using soft diplomacy and now the us is playing a multilateral game and that is music to asean ’ s ears , " says thayer .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .

but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.07.2010 seven european banks fail eu stress tests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european markets will rise or fall on the test results european banking regulators have released the results of their so-called stress tests .
many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .

they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 new revelations about asbestos use in india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asbestos use is growing in developing countries such as india a nine-month investigation by the international consortium of investigative journalists has shown how political lobbying and ad buying ensures that asbestos is freely marketed in developing countries such as india . for over 13 years , shashwati sarkar , a domestic help , has been living in a shanty town along a railway line in the indian capital , new delhi .
of late she has been complaining of breathlessness .
she knows it could be the result of asbestos-related ailments and if untreated could possibly lead to lung cancer and skin diseases .
but shashwati says she has no option but to continue living in her house made of this dangerous material .
" for years now i have been living under a roof made of asbestos .
and so are the doors .
of late when i close the door , i feel a problem in my breathing .
but what shall i do ?
we are poor , and where can we go ?
i know of the bad effects of asbestos especially when particles fall . "
rise in asbestos use the indian asbestos industry generates more than $ 850 million a year in revenue , and directly employs 300,000 people ; indirectly , it supports as many as 3 million more .
backed by a powerful lobby , asbestos use in india has risen by 83 percent since 2004 , according to government figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at an asbestos mine in udaipur , india given evidence of poor workplace safety and weak regulations , such widespread use could prove disastrous , say health experts .
asbestos products carry no health warning labels and trade unions have no mandate to prevent asbestos-related disease at workplaces .
indian consumers are also unlikely to know that as asbestos-cement erodes and crumbles , dangerous fibers are released .
" even if a single fiber is inhaled , it is capable of causing mesothelioma , and that has been proven by epidemiological as well clinical and experimental studies , " says dr sanjay chaturvedi , a professor of community medicine .
" we have to preclude all possible release of asbestos in the environment wherever there is a possibility of human exposure . "
hazardous effects research has shown that worldwide , at least 90,000 people die every year from illnesses resulting from occupational exposure to asbestos .
however , this number only takes into account workers and ex-workers who have been identified with asbestos-related lung cancer , mesothelioma , and asbestosis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an asbestos mine worker in andhra pradesh , india gopal krishna , who heads the ban asbestos network of india , says as the market is growing at a tremendous pace , nobody in india has time to deal with complaints .
" there is an incestuous relationship between the asbestos manufacturing industry in india , the government and the political parties .
that incestuous relationship has led to it being supported .
in india we have some 300 medical colleges .
none of them has the competence to diagnose the diseases caused by asbestos .
so lack of documentation does not mean a lack of a problem in india .
the rate of consumption of asbestos is rising at an alarming rate , so are the diseases caused by asbestos . "
but as the indian states and union territories have no mechanism to prove that lung cancer deaths and other skin diseases are being caused by asbestos exposures , the indian asbestos industry could not care less about global efforts to ban the material everywhere including india . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.07.2010 italian autonomous car to drive from italy to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car will travel about 13,000 kilometers -lrb- 8,100 miles -rrb- between italy and china university of parma scientists have pioneered robotic cars that can navigate on their own .
they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 23.07.2010 german f1 star vettel needs a strong showing at hockenheim großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's not number one just now , but he really should be sebastian vettel is gunning for a home win this weekend at formula one 's german grand prix .
vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 23.07.2010 german f1 star vettel needs a strong showing at hockenheim großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's not number one just now , but he really should be sebastian vettel is gunning for a home win this weekend at formula one 's german grand prix .
vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 23.07.2010 airbus decrees recession ' definitively over ' after positive air show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing flew in its 787 , but airbus landed more sales european aerospace giant airbus did a roaring trade at the farnborough international airshow in britain this week , including landing a major deal with virgin airlines . the franco-german company airbus was positively bullish after selling 130 planes and securing pledges for the future purchase of a further 122 at the farnborough international airshow this week .
" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "
airbus says the deals it has either sealed or set up at the british air show will eventually be worth almost 22 billion euros , and the company is considering further increases in production of its smaller , single-aisle a320 family to cope with rising demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' a380 is the new flagship , but not the cash cow " this was a good airshow for us and i think it was a good airshow for the aviation industry , " airbus chief executive thomas enders said on thursday , after the last major day for doing business at the farnborough show , which remains open to the public until sunday .
gains across the industry airbus 's strong sales were a welcome boon at farnborough , especially after the company 's us rival boeing flew in its new 787 dreamliner for its debut appearance outside the states .
the 787 is boeing 's answer to the airbus a380 superjumbo , and although it has a lower seating capacity and shorter range , many analysts predict its comparatively modest size could make it more saleable than airbus ' record-breaking passenger jet .
boeing has reported 103 new orders worth roughly eight billion euros at the trade fair , saying this performance points to a " continued recovery " for the industry .
aviation mogul steve udvar-hazy - a pioneer of the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s - also made a big-spending return in farnborough , ordering 100 airbus and boeing jets for his new business , air lease corp , triggering more orders from rival leasing companies .
airline shares have responded positively to the performance , although the apparent spike in sales is still being fuelled by emerging markets , with airlines in europe and north america relatively cautious .
sales at the biennial farnborough trade fair may not have approached the record levels of 2008 , when almost 70 billion euros changed hands , but they 're still a massive improvement on 2009 's post-financial crisis sister air show at le bourget , near paris , when sales totaled a meager 5.4 billion euros .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 23.07.2010 airbus decrees recession ' definitively over ' after positive air show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing flew in its 787 , but airbus landed more sales european aerospace giant airbus did a roaring trade at the farnborough international airshow in britain this week , including landing a major deal with virgin airlines . the franco-german company airbus was positively bullish after selling 130 planes and securing pledges for the future purchase of a further 122 at the farnborough international airshow this week .
" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "
airbus says the deals it has either sealed or set up at the british air show will eventually be worth almost 22 billion euros , and the company is considering further increases in production of its smaller , single-aisle a320 family to cope with rising demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' a380 is the new flagship , but not the cash cow " this was a good airshow for us and i think it was a good airshow for the aviation industry , " airbus chief executive thomas enders said on thursday , after the last major day for doing business at the farnborough show , which remains open to the public until sunday .
gains across the industry airbus 's strong sales were a welcome boon at farnborough , especially after the company 's us rival boeing flew in its new 787 dreamliner for its debut appearance outside the states .
the 787 is boeing 's answer to the airbus a380 superjumbo , and although it has a lower seating capacity and shorter range , many analysts predict its comparatively modest size could make it more saleable than airbus ' record-breaking passenger jet .
boeing has reported 103 new orders worth roughly eight billion euros at the trade fair , saying this performance points to a " continued recovery " for the industry .
aviation mogul steve udvar-hazy - a pioneer of the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s - also made a big-spending return in farnborough , ordering 100 airbus and boeing jets for his new business , air lease corp , triggering more orders from rival leasing companies .
airline shares have responded positively to the performance , although the apparent spike in sales is still being fuelled by emerging markets , with airlines in europe and north america relatively cautious .
sales at the biennial farnborough trade fair may not have approached the record levels of 2008 , when almost 70 billion euros changed hands , but they 're still a massive improvement on 2009 's post-financial crisis sister air show at le bourget , near paris , when sales totaled a meager 5.4 billion euros .

but at least 500 of them will have to be sold before airbus can make a profit on the plane .
-lrb- 09.06.2010 -rrb- airbus pens record a380 deal with emirates airbus , the european maker of the new a380 " superjumbo , " says it has agreed a deal to sell a record number of the new planes to dubai-based airline emirates in a deal worth an estimated $ 11.5 billion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 23.07.2010 algae bloom suffocates life in the baltic sea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching the shore : algae in the harbour of stralsund they 're generating menacing images , and can be a serious environmental threat : algae are spreading across the baltic , depleting the oxygen which plants and animals need to survive , but how bad is the situation really ? high temperatures , light winds and an absence of waves : every year in summer algae get comfortable in the baltic sea , floating on the surface , shining green and blue - and suffocating aquatic life .
this year it seems especially bad .
the affected area is almost the size of germany and even visible from outer space .
it appears like a gigantic foul-smelling carpet , 377 000 square kilometers in size , spreading from finland to the german-polish border and to the island of ruegen .
it is the biggest algae explosion since 2005 .
a combination of farming and weather bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wwf says current conditions are ' perfect ' for algae growth it 's not just the sunny weather which is driving the bloom .
it 's also the large quantity of phosphorus in the water .
" over-fertilization is the biggest environmental problem facing the baltic , " said jochen lamp from the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in hamburg .
the phosphates are being washed off farmland and from rivers into the baltic sea .
wwf has criticized countries bordering on the baltic for their disjointed response to the problem .
on the one hand they seem eager to reduce over-fertilization , on the other they encourage farmers to use more fertilizers .
sweden for example has abolished its tax on fertilizers and in the north-eastern part of germany , in mecklenburg-western pomerania , farmers are now allowed to manure their land within a meter of dikes and creeks - it used to be seven meters .
algae cause death zones in the water algae blooms can be disastrous for ecoystems , causing dead zones under water .
they suck up the oxygen , leaving none for plants and animals .
" this is especially bad for fish , crawfish , starfish and crabs living in the ground .
their lives are severely affected and in the worst case they die , " says wera leujak , specialist for oceanic security at the german federal environment agency .
the baltic sea already has quite a number of these dead zones , but the algae exacerbate them .
for humans , the blue-green algae are unhealthy as well .
they can cause skin rashes , allergic reactions or diarrhoea and damage the liver .
bildunterschrift : the blue-green algae bloom can even be seen from space clear water , clear samples yet despite a media uproar in europe this week , the situation is not that much worse than normal .
on thursday , a research ship took water samples from the baltic sea on the west coast of ruegen .
" at least for this area , we can give the all-clear , " said harald stegemann , head of the state environmental office for mecklenburg-western pomerania in guestrow , who initiated the operation .
" the samples looked like tap water and the colleagues on board did n't see any algae carpets , although we expected it to be different . "
on other parts of the baltic sea algae are visible .
" there are these tiny little algae floating around and colouring the water green and yellowish , " said thomas merck .
he works on the small island of vilm near ruegen and has lived there for a couple of years now .
" speaking from experience , all i can say is : it just happens regularly . "
algae comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , beaches have stayed open - with a bit of rain the algae may even disappear .
for this reason , local scientists are reluctant to join the hysteria .
of course the area looks huge on satellite images .
" but the important question is : is it just a film of two or three millimeters or is it a real carpet of two or three centimeters ? "
stegemann explains .
for him , it does not seem to be very dramatic , though he concedes that sufficient data has not yet been gathered to dismiss the problem out of hand .
in any event , the carpet may well disappear during the next few days anyway : " if it cools down , if it gets stormy , if it rains , the water will intermingle and it 's all over , " stegemann said .

he works on the small island of vilm near ruegen and has lived there for a couple of years now .
" speaking from experience , all i can say is : it just happens regularly . "
algae comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , beaches have stayed open - with a bit of rain the algae may even disappear .
for this reason , local scientists are reluctant to join the hysteria .
of course the area looks huge on satellite images .
" but the important question is : is it just a film of two or three millimeters or is it a real carpet of two or three centimeters ? "
stegemann explains .
for him , it does not seem to be very dramatic , though he concedes that sufficient data has not yet been gathered to dismiss the problem out of hand .
in any event , the carpet may well disappear during the next few days anyway : " if it cools down , if it gets stormy , if it rains , the water will intermingle and it 's all over , " stegemann said .

while the us senate is investigating , experts are n't surprised . the senators were incensed .
in an open letter to the us secretary of state on july 13 , four democratic lawmakers urged hillary clinton to fully investigate reports about a possible link between bp and the release of the convicted lockerbie bomber by the british government .
" the question we now have to answer is , was this corporation willing to trade justice in the murder of 270 innocent people for oil profits ? " the senators ask in their letter .
on july 29 , the senate foreign relations committee will convene a hearing on the issue . at the heart of the case is abdelbaset al-megrahi , a libyan national who was convicted of blowing up pan am flight 103 in 1988 over the scottish village of lockerbie .
270 people , including 189 americans , were killed in the downing of the airliner .
al-megrahi was released in august last year on compassionate grounds because he was diagnosed with a terminal illness .
his release and the subsequent hero 's welcome he received in libya caused a public outcry in the us .
bp lobbied for a prisoner deal , not for al-megrahi two days after the senators ' letter was published , bp admitted that it had in fact lobbied the british government in 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with libya because it was concerned a slow resolution would impact an offshore drilling deal with libya .
the prisoner deal was ultimately agreed upon by the british government in 2007 , the same year bp reached an exploration deal worth 900 million dollars with libya .
while bp admitted lobbying for the prisoner deal , it said it was not involved in discussions about the freeing of al-megrahi .
" the decision to release al-megrahi in august 2009 was taken by the scottish government , " bp said in a statement on july 15 " it is not for bp to comment on the decision of the scottish government .
bp was not involved in any such discussions about the release of al-megrahi . "
according to the oil company 's statement , " bp told the uk government that we were concerned about the slow progress that was being made in concluding a prisoner transfer agreement with libya . "
" we were aware that this could have a negative impact on uk commercial interests , including the ratification by the libyan government of bp 's exploration agreement , " the statement read .
lobbying power house asked whether he was surprised about bp 's admitted lobbying for a controversial prisoner release deal with libya , thomas seifert , who wrote an acclaimed book on the oil industry and works as foreign affairs editor at the austrian daily " die presse " , is unequivocal : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelbaset al-megrahi was welcomed in tripoli by the libyan leader 's son , seif al-islam gadhafi " no , not at all , " he said .
" it 's about a 900 million dollar deal in libya and that 's why bp lobbied .
and that 's not a crime , and of course they can do that .
we all can lobby our governments for better schools and universities or things like that .
but of course it helps quite a bit if you have the firepower of multi-billion dollar companies to pay lobbyists who have gone the revolving door in and out of governments and have a pretty good network in the governments . "
dave levinthal , communications director with the center for responsive politics in washington , which runs the lobbying clearinghouse opensecrets.org , put the current case of bp 's lobbying for a prisoner deal in a larger context : " certainly what we see in the united states is that bp , particularly in recent years , has really spent a considerable amount of money on lobbying efforts and lobbying federal level politicians in the united states .
so it does serve to reason that they would be doing similar things , be it in britain or otherwise in europe when it comes to political lobbying . "
according to levinthal , bp spent more than 15 million dollars last year alone for lobbying the us federal government .
that ranks the company fourth among all oil and gas related corporations in terms of lobbying expenditure .
only exxonmobil , chevron , conocophilips spent more money lobbying the us government than bp .
" it 's important to note that they have a small army of lobbyists , " said levinthal .
they have literally dozens of people who lobby on their behalf and when you consider just that mere fact , they have a lot of resources to draw from . "
friends lobbying friends but perhaps even more important than the sheer amount of money poured into lobbying is the cadre of people bp hires to do the job .
" when you go a little bit deeper you notice that many of the people bp has hired as lobbyists are actually former government officials , " said levinthal .
" they are in some cases former federal level staffers , they are former congressional staffers , in some cases they are even former members of congress . "
bildunterschrift : last month , bp ceo tony hayward had to testify on capitol hill about the oil spill in the gulf of mexico for companies like bp it makes perfect sense to hire people who know the political system .
" these are people who have worked in the government , these are people who have friends in the government " , said levinthal .
" and just like if you wanted to try to convince your friend to do something , you probably have a much better chance of convincing your friend to do what you want than a perfect stranger . "
details of lobbying usually do n't become public apparently that is also how bp lobbied the british government over the prisoner transfer deal .
according to the " wall street journal , " bp told the paper that a special adviser to bp who had previously worked for the british intelligence service mi6 had raised the prisoner transfer agreement , but not the specific case of al mehgrahi , with then-justice secretary jack straw .
although it is easy to single out bp for criticism for their lobbying practices , that 's not really fair , notes thomas seifert : " if you have a certain size of an industry or of a company then basically the interest of this company might coincide with the interest of this country .
we are talking about thousands of jobs ; we are talking about providing the energy infrastructure , providing the lifeblood of our whole industrial system , so it 's pretty significant . "
what 's more , adds seifert , most other international energy companies are also engaged in lobbying all over the world to get access to oil and gas reserves .
however , what is unusual about the bp case is not necessarily the lobbying efforts themselves , but the fact that this kind of detailed information has become public .
perhaps the senators will unearth even more aspects of bp 's efforts to influence the british government in their hearing on the case .

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .

the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.07.2010 italian autonomous car to drive from italy to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car will travel about 13,000 kilometers -lrb- 8,100 miles -rrb- between italy and china university of parma scientists have pioneered robotic cars that can navigate on their own .
they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the call comes as the oil spill in the gulf of mexico near its 15th week . with the bp oil spill fiasco in the gulf of mexico entering its fourth month , germany 's environment minister , norbert roettgen , has called for a moratorium on new oil drilling in the north sea .
roettgen said the measure should be taken until an investigation can determine exactly what went wrong in the oil rig explosion that led to the spill off the united states coast , which has become the country 's worst-ever environmental disaster .
" we take risks , but we ca n't take every risk , " roettgen told public broadcaster zdf .
" without safety there can be no drilling . "
roettgen said , however , he doubted that other north sea countries would go along with a moratorium .
he added that environmental and safety standards applied to north sea drilling operations differed from those used in the united states .
countries straddling the north sea include norway , denmark , the netherlands , belgium , france , britain and germany .
the calls by the german environment minister come two weeks after european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger called for a halt on deep sea drilling - a demand that was rebuffed by a number of eu states , including the uk .
individual eu member states are responsible for approving or rejecting drilling proposals in their own waters .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .

the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .

science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 23.07.2010 german courts are reluctant to abandon practice of preventive detention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german prisoners can remain in jail well after their original terms end under current german law , courts can rule to keep violent offenders imprisoned indefinitely .
the european court of human rights in strasburg has ruled this preventive detention is an affront to human rights . regional courts in germany are currently deciding individually on how to handle dangerous repeat offenders whose court sentences are up .
several months ago the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled against germany 's use of preventive detention in such cases , which it said was tantamount to post facto punishment .
under a 1998 law , german courts can rule to keep prisoners deemed to be societal threats under so-called " preventive detention " for an indefinite period after they have served their official sentences .
following the echr 's ruling , some german courts fell in line , but most decided to wait for the federal constitutional court to rule on the matter .
' not a form of punishment ' as many as 70 violent offenders may soon be released in accordance with the echr decision in the state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- alone .
these prisoners are the particularly questionable , so-called " old cases . "
they were sentenced to prison with the possibility of preventive detention before 1998 - when an amendment lifted a 10-year time limit on post-term detention .
in their cases , the new law was applied retroactively to keep them in jail after they had finished their actual prison terms and 10 years of post-term preventive detention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the echr in strasbourg says preventive detention goes against human rights in nrw the regional appeals court in the city of cologne is one of the many to uphold current german law despite the echr ruling .
court spokesman hubertus nolte told deutsche welle that under german law , " preventive detention is not a form of punishment " but " a safety measure for the general public , to protect the people against dangerous repeat offenders . "
a violation of the right to liberty the echr , however , views preventive detention as punitive , and in the case of reinhard m. versus germany , the echr ruled that the retroactive implementation of indefinite preventive detention was a violation of human rights .
in 1986 , reinhard m. was sentenced to 5 years in prison with the possibility of preventive detention . however , when 2001 came , the time when he was expecting to be released , a court retroactively applied the 1998 amendment to the criminal code that lifted the time limit on preventive detention - and reinhard m. remained behind bars .
in a ruling in may this year , the european court found that m. 's " continued preventive detention violated his right to liberty , " a court spokesperson told deutsche welle .
the court also ruled that the plaintiff 's further imprisonment was unlawful " in particular as there was not a sufficient causal connection between his conviction in 1986 and his continued detention , after the completion of ten years in preventive detention . "
dragging heels in germany thomas ullenbruch , a judge at the emmendingen circuit court , sees the decision in strasbourg as a call to action for german courts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is for more careful use of preventive detention instead , he says , they are only dragging their heels .
" although the decision from strasbourg was anything but surprising , an unprecedented chaos now reigns , " he told zdf television , adding that , " clear guidelines must be implemented in dozens of cases .
up till now very few people have been released and even the federal constitutional court has been putting the issue off . "
while some german regional courts have heeded the echr 's decision and have begun releasing " old case " prisoners , cologne 's court authorities have refused do so until there is a ruling on the matter from the federal constitutional court .
" our court , like other state courts in germany , is of the opinion that we ca n't simply apply the decision of the echr as if it were german law , " nolte said .
judges ' are n't psychics ' another issue at hand is the use of preventive detention in cases where it was not mentioned during sentencing at all .
germany 's federal minister of justice , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , does not wish to do away with preventive detention but said in an interview with zdf television that she wanted to see judges making use of it more often when first sentencing criminals , thus eliminating the need to impose it retroactively .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger 's stance has met with criticism from state-level justice authorities , especially in parts of the country ruled by conservatives from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bavaria 's minister of justice beate merk of the csu , sees one major " safety flaw " in limiting courts ' rights to keep dangerous criminals away from society : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merk says judges " are n't psychics " " our judges are n't psychics .
maybe the federal minister of justice thinks they are , but they are n't .
if during a prisoner 's term , new facts come to light and with them new insight , judges can only act then , " she said .
" for that scenario we need the ability to implement preventive custody retroactively . "
merk added that her state would not release any dangerous offenders unless ordered to do so by leutheusser-schnarrenberger 's ministry of justice .
until that occurs - if it does - courts in bavaria and all over germany will continue to hold repeat offenders in prison for as long as they see fit .

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .

and asean individual states feel it -lrb- cheonan -rrb- is a bilateral issue and they usually abhor using force and threats that they see the us is applying .

on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .
observers believe this , however , is unlikely . " in 2002 they negotiated a very weak declaration on the conduct of parties .
and that initial document was supposed to be the first step towards a code of conduct .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .
there is nothing they could do more , says carl thayer , an expert on the southeast asian affairs at the australian defense force academy . " the asean regional forum can take no position that is compulsory on all members .
and asean individual states feel it -lrb- cheonan -rrb- is a bilateral issue and they usually abhor using force and threats that they see the us is applying . " delegates also discussed myanmar 's political process and human rights situation . according to janos martonyi , the hungarian foreign minister , myanmar is at a crossroads .
he called on the country to hold fair elections and release political prisoners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean foreign minister park ui chun myanmar and south china sea the us , on the other hand also raised concerns over myanmar 's alleged nuclear activities .
on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .
observers believe this , however , is unlikely . " in 2002 they negotiated a very weak declaration on the conduct of parties .
and that initial document was supposed to be the first step towards a code of conduct .
from 2002 to 2010 , it is eight years , we have n't proceeded .
so i do n't see a prospect of a binding code of conduct anytime soon , " says thayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south china sea islands are believed to be rich in resources influence of the us and china over the years china has become an important participant at the arf meetings .
so has the us .
thayer says the focus of us diplomacy is shifting .
under bush the us administration concentrated more on the global war on terror .
now the obama administration is showing a greater commitment to southeastern asia in response to the chinese challenge . " i think during the bush administration , china made great inroads using soft diplomacy and now the us is playing a multilateral game and that is music to asean ’ s ears , " says thayer .
" asean wants the each super power to come to it rather than the superpowers impacting it . " to enhance its partnerships and bilateral ties , the us is planning to hold a summit for southeast asian leaders in washington later this year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 23.07.2010 algae bloom suffocates life in the baltic sea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching the shore : algae in the harbour of stralsund they 're generating menacing images , and can be a serious environmental threat : algae are spreading across the baltic , depleting the oxygen which plants and animals need to survive , but how bad is the situation really ? high temperatures , light winds and an absence of waves : every year in summer algae get comfortable in the baltic sea , floating on the surface , shining green and blue - and suffocating aquatic life .
this year it seems especially bad .
the affected area is almost the size of germany and even visible from outer space .
it appears like a gigantic foul-smelling carpet , 377 000 square kilometers in size , spreading from finland to the german-polish border and to the island of ruegen .
it is the biggest algae explosion since 2005 .
a combination of farming and weather bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wwf says current conditions are ' perfect ' for algae growth it 's not just the sunny weather which is driving the bloom .
it 's also the large quantity of phosphorus in the water .
" over-fertilization is the biggest environmental problem facing the baltic , " said jochen lamp from the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in hamburg .
the phosphates are being washed off farmland and from rivers into the baltic sea .
wwf has criticized countries bordering on the baltic for their disjointed response to the problem .
on the one hand they seem eager to reduce over-fertilization , on the other they encourage farmers to use more fertilizers .
sweden for example has abolished its tax on fertilizers and in the north-eastern part of germany , in mecklenburg-western pomerania , farmers are now allowed to manure their land within a meter of dikes and creeks - it used to be seven meters .
algae cause death zones in the water algae blooms can be disastrous for ecoystems , causing dead zones under water .
they suck up the oxygen , leaving none for plants and animals .
" this is especially bad for fish , crawfish , starfish and crabs living in the ground .
their lives are severely affected and in the worst case they die , " says wera leujak , specialist for oceanic security at the german federal environment agency .
the baltic sea already has quite a number of these dead zones , but the algae exacerbate them .
for humans , the blue-green algae are unhealthy as well .
they can cause skin rashes , allergic reactions or diarrhoea and damage the liver .
bildunterschrift : the blue-green algae bloom can even be seen from space clear water , clear samples yet despite a media uproar in europe this week , the situation is not that much worse than normal .
on thursday , a research ship took water samples from the baltic sea on the west coast of ruegen .
" at least for this area , we can give the all-clear , " said harald stegemann , head of the state environmental office for mecklenburg-western pomerania in guestrow , who initiated the operation .
" the samples looked like tap water and the colleagues on board did n't see any algae carpets , although we expected it to be different . "
on other parts of the baltic sea algae are visible .
" there are these tiny little algae floating around and colouring the water green and yellowish , " said thomas merck .
he works on the small island of vilm near ruegen and has lived there for a couple of years now .
" speaking from experience , all i can say is : it just happens regularly . "
algae comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , beaches have stayed open - with a bit of rain the algae may even disappear .
for this reason , local scientists are reluctant to join the hysteria .
of course the area looks huge on satellite images .
" but the important question is : is it just a film of two or three millimeters or is it a real carpet of two or three centimeters ? "
stegemann explains .
for him , it does not seem to be very dramatic , though he concedes that sufficient data has not yet been gathered to dismiss the problem out of hand .
in any event , the carpet may well disappear during the next few days anyway : " if it cools down , if it gets stormy , if it rains , the water will intermingle and it 's all over , " stegemann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 23.07.2010 us senate to probe possible links between bp and the release of the lockerbie bomber großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers want to know whether bp played a role in the release of the lockerbie bomber already under fire for the oil spill , bp has admitted lobbying the uk government over a controversial prisoner release deal with libya .
while the us senate is investigating , experts are n't surprised . the senators were incensed .
in an open letter to the us secretary of state on july 13 , four democratic lawmakers urged hillary clinton to fully investigate reports about a possible link between bp and the release of the convicted lockerbie bomber by the british government .
" the question we now have to answer is , was this corporation willing to trade justice in the murder of 270 innocent people for oil profits ? " the senators ask in their letter .
on july 29 , the senate foreign relations committee will convene a hearing on the issue . at the heart of the case is abdelbaset al-megrahi , a libyan national who was convicted of blowing up pan am flight 103 in 1988 over the scottish village of lockerbie .
270 people , including 189 americans , were killed in the downing of the airliner .
al-megrahi was released in august last year on compassionate grounds because he was diagnosed with a terminal illness .
his release and the subsequent hero 's welcome he received in libya caused a public outcry in the us .
bp lobbied for a prisoner deal , not for al-megrahi two days after the senators ' letter was published , bp admitted that it had in fact lobbied the british government in 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with libya because it was concerned a slow resolution would impact an offshore drilling deal with libya .
the prisoner deal was ultimately agreed upon by the british government in 2007 , the same year bp reached an exploration deal worth 900 million dollars with libya .
while bp admitted lobbying for the prisoner deal , it said it was not involved in discussions about the freeing of al-megrahi .
" the decision to release al-megrahi in august 2009 was taken by the scottish government , " bp said in a statement on july 15 " it is not for bp to comment on the decision of the scottish government .
bp was not involved in any such discussions about the release of al-megrahi . "
according to the oil company 's statement , " bp told the uk government that we were concerned about the slow progress that was being made in concluding a prisoner transfer agreement with libya . "
" we were aware that this could have a negative impact on uk commercial interests , including the ratification by the libyan government of bp 's exploration agreement , " the statement read .
lobbying power house asked whether he was surprised about bp 's admitted lobbying for a controversial prisoner release deal with libya , thomas seifert , who wrote an acclaimed book on the oil industry and works as foreign affairs editor at the austrian daily " die presse " , is unequivocal : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelbaset al-megrahi was welcomed in tripoli by the libyan leader 's son , seif al-islam gadhafi " no , not at all , " he said .
" it 's about a 900 million dollar deal in libya and that 's why bp lobbied .
and that 's not a crime , and of course they can do that .
we all can lobby our governments for better schools and universities or things like that .
but of course it helps quite a bit if you have the firepower of multi-billion dollar companies to pay lobbyists who have gone the revolving door in and out of governments and have a pretty good network in the governments . "
dave levinthal , communications director with the center for responsive politics in washington , which runs the lobbying clearinghouse opensecrets.org , put the current case of bp 's lobbying for a prisoner deal in a larger context : " certainly what we see in the united states is that bp , particularly in recent years , has really spent a considerable amount of money on lobbying efforts and lobbying federal level politicians in the united states .
so it does serve to reason that they would be doing similar things , be it in britain or otherwise in europe when it comes to political lobbying . "
according to levinthal , bp spent more than 15 million dollars last year alone for lobbying the us federal government .
that ranks the company fourth among all oil and gas related corporations in terms of lobbying expenditure .
only exxonmobil , chevron , conocophilips spent more money lobbying the us government than bp .
" it 's important to note that they have a small army of lobbyists , " said levinthal .
they have literally dozens of people who lobby on their behalf and when you consider just that mere fact , they have a lot of resources to draw from . "
friends lobbying friends but perhaps even more important than the sheer amount of money poured into lobbying is the cadre of people bp hires to do the job .
" when you go a little bit deeper you notice that many of the people bp has hired as lobbyists are actually former government officials , " said levinthal .
" they are in some cases former federal level staffers , they are former congressional staffers , in some cases they are even former members of congress . "
bildunterschrift : last month , bp ceo tony hayward had to testify on capitol hill about the oil spill in the gulf of mexico for companies like bp it makes perfect sense to hire people who know the political system .
" these are people who have worked in the government , these are people who have friends in the government " , said levinthal .
" and just like if you wanted to try to convince your friend to do something , you probably have a much better chance of convincing your friend to do what you want than a perfect stranger . "
details of lobbying usually do n't become public apparently that is also how bp lobbied the british government over the prisoner transfer deal .
according to the " wall street journal , " bp told the paper that a special adviser to bp who had previously worked for the british intelligence service mi6 had raised the prisoner transfer agreement , but not the specific case of al mehgrahi , with then-justice secretary jack straw .
although it is easy to single out bp for criticism for their lobbying practices , that 's not really fair , notes thomas seifert : " if you have a certain size of an industry or of a company then basically the interest of this company might coincide with the interest of this country .
we are talking about thousands of jobs ; we are talking about providing the energy infrastructure , providing the lifeblood of our whole industrial system , so it 's pretty significant . "
what 's more , adds seifert , most other international energy companies are also engaged in lobbying all over the world to get access to oil and gas reserves .
however , what is unusual about the bp case is not necessarily the lobbying efforts themselves , but the fact that this kind of detailed information has become public .
perhaps the senators will unearth even more aspects of bp 's efforts to influence the british government in their hearing on the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.07.2010 italian autonomous car to drive from italy to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car will travel about 13,000 kilometers -lrb- 8,100 miles -rrb- between italy and china university of parma scientists have pioneered robotic cars that can navigate on their own .
they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2010 when it gets too hot in berlin , it 's time to head to brandenburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the 30-something , latte-drinking generation has finished colonizing central berlin , it 's set its sights on the backwaters of brandenburg .
jane paulick wonders if the provinces got the short end of the stick . it 's been eye-meltingly hot in berlin for the last few weeks , and everyone who can is escaping the city whenever they have a free moment .
as luck would have it , receding ice age glaciers left literally hundreds of lakes scattered around the brandenburg countryside outside berlin , and this summer , i 've been struck by the growing number of people who 've acquired their own private waterside retreat . brandenburg , it seems , is to berlin what the hamptons are to new york - only it 's not , because a summer house on long island is a luxury financially far beyond the reach of mere mortals , whereas a dacha in the hinterlands of the german capital can still be had for a song . so while i 've been kidding myself that the city 's many outdoor swimming pools are actually quite nice places to be on my days off - despite the fact they 're overrun by teenage gangs and there are fries and fag-ends floating in the water - most long-time berlin residents simply would n't dream of spending a weekend in the city . feudal fantasies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise on berlin 's doorstep it 's not that surprising that so many of the ossis -lrb- east germans -rrb- i know own country abodes .
many of them inherited houses from their parents or grandparents , while others who grew up with brandenburg on their doorstep were snapping up bijou property bargains in its untamed , sunflower-filled lowlands long before these reached the radars of the hordes of west germans who only moved to berlin in the last decade . until recently , these denizens of hip neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg , mitte and kreuzberg would n't have set foot in the prussian provinces .
but it seems there 's been a shift in perceptions , and brandenburg is no longer considered such a final frontier . my suspicions were confirmed when , last week on the tram , i saw someone reading a book by swiss tv personality dieter moor about his attempts to run an organic farm near werneuchen , northeast of berlin - and later that day while flicking through the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , i noticed it was number three on its bestseller list . then there 's cabaret singer rainald grebe , currently satirizing urbanites ' sudden love affair with what used to be the badlands of brandenburg in his new show at the maxim gorki theater called " back to nature . " his conclusion is that it 's just another form of consumerism . " these fantasies of bucolic living are nothing more than complete greediness , " he said in a recent interview with berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine tip .
not that he 's blameless - he also dreams of the simple life . " it 's about having it all ; living in the city ; being networked and having your finger on the pulse - but also having a house in the country .
it 's not as though i actually want to weed , milk cows and grow tomatoes , " continued grebe , " it 's just some feudal fantasy of being a landowner lording it over the locals .
all i really want to do is sit in the sun , drink a latte macchiato and enjoy a view of a lake . " pastoral paradise sounds good to me .
never immune to the vagaries of fashion , i too have started dreaming of a lakeside getaway i might call my own . my first step has been to overcome some prejudices . admittedly , brandenburg does n't have the best of reputations . it 's associated first and foremost with neo-nazis , failed industry and a mass exodus of young people and doctors - and after several weekends spent driving around scouting for empty property , i can personally confirm there really are no doctors : one day when i realized i had an inflamed tick bite , i was sent by the friends i was visiting to get an antibiotics prescription from a veterinarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " was filmed on location in brandenburg as for the neo-nazis , i 'm assured by the same friends that the locals are salt of the earth and highly unlikely to vote far-right .
fair point .
state elections last september actually saw more than two thirds of the population vote either for the social democrats , the left party or the greens , and the region 's most famous daughter is none other than the ever-moderate chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in templin . other exemplary brandenburgers include 19th-century writer theodor fontane - who paid its rural charms loving tribute in his novels - and prussia 's most famous architect , karl friedrich schinkel , who left his mark in the form of countless palaces , villas and village churches . of yuppies and yokels if you 've seen michael hanecke 's oscar-nominated 2009 movie " the white ribbon , " then you know what a brandenburg village looks like : wide , cobblestone avenues that time seems to have forgotten , lined with chestnut trees and low farmhouses dating back at least 100 years . needless to say , it 's this historic , pre-communist architecture that appeals to berliners seeking scenic rustic tranquility , many of whom i 've encountered at the various public viewings of houses for sale that i 've attended in the last few months .
i 've even seen people i recognize from my local organic supermarket , although i 've never seen anyone who looks like they might be interested in buying something more permanent than a holiday home . few people want to live in brandenburg full-time .
one property valuation report i leafed through referred to the mass unemployment and inadequate infrastructure that characterize the region .
none of these factors matter much to the affluent berliners who can jump back in their suvs on sunday night after a relaxing few days in their converted barns . they ca n't be accused of pricing out locals , because locals are leaving in droves anyway .
but the way these townies are colonizing the countryside is a little unpalatable .
it 's obvious what 's in for them - but what 's in it for brandenburg ?
i hope that sooner or later , it might at least start to reap some benefits from gentrification - even the g-word would be better than defunct train stations and empty school yards . author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but criticism of germany 's economic model is growing louder as experts call on germans to stimulate domestic demand . until recently , german exports were suffering due to the economic crisis , but those days are nearly forgotten , and exports are taking off again .
statistics showed that the country 's exports recovered twice as much as expected in may .
goods worth 77.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- left germany 's borders , which represents an increase of nearly 30 percent compared to last year . " germany 's export model is functioning very well , " michael heise , chief economist at the allianz group said . heise added that the companies that rely on industrial exports , as many in germany do , often suffer worst during an economic downturn . " that 's what explains last year 's drop of 5 percent , which was much higher than in other countries , " he said , adding that when the economy is doing well , it translates to above average growth for german exporters . non-eu exports growing fastest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial exports that get hit hard in tough times tend to bounce back faster exports to outside of europe , with china , india and brazil leading the way , have been increasing twice as much as exports headed to european nations .
that has some in europe concerned since germany 's trade surpluses are creating deficits for its neighbors . french finance minister christine lagarde has said germany 's trade surpluses are due to the minimal salary hikes its workers get and can not be maintained over the long term .
similar statements have come from the united states , which would like to see germany do more to boost demand and cut its budget less . it 's a criticism heise said he can understand . " it 's essential that we increase domestic economic activity and demand in germany , " he said .
" that 's what foreign countries are demanding as our part in eliminating imbalances - and we 're going to have to show some that we 're doing something . " who has to change most ? the disagreement focuses on whether only southern europe 's less competitive nations have to change their policies or if well-off nations like germany should also do more to contribute to bringing economic balance back to europe .
even as the euro grows stronger against the dollar , germany was able to step up its exports between 2000 and 2008 by 65 percent .
that was largely because wages lagged behind productivity , which equated to a real devaluation for germans and kept up the country 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : views differ on which countries have to take measures to help the whole of europe now , with exports rising again , the united states has said germany , as well as other european nations , should foster the fledgling recovery with stimulus measures rather than slashing public spending .
but germany 's government has insisted it will not introduce new economic stimulus packages . " the strategy can not be that we start taking on more national debts and artificially expand state consumption , " heise said .
" we have to stimulate private consumption and investment demand . " he added that changing labor and employment policies , modifying the tax system and limiting bureaucracy would all contribute to evening out trade imbalances .
but there are also more radical measures being considered , some of which call for germany to give up some of its ability to compete . more german than the germans " it is absurd that germans advise their neighbors to copy german traits , " said martin wolf , chief economist at the financial times , adding that it would make more sense for germans to take on debt , boost pay and become more european . competitiveness is generally measured by unit labor costs .
the european statistics office indexed these costs using the year 2000 as its base .
nine years later , the index gives southern european nations a value of about 130 , france scored 118 and germany at 105 ; showing that most european countries have lost the fight for competitiveness to germany . and germany does not see any reason to turn back the clock on gains it has made .

but criticism of germany 's economic model is growing louder as experts call on germans to stimulate domestic demand . until recently , german exports were suffering due to the economic crisis , but those days are nearly forgotten , and exports are taking off again .
statistics showed that the country 's exports recovered twice as much as expected in may .
goods worth 77.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- left germany 's borders , which represents an increase of nearly 30 percent compared to last year . " germany 's export model is functioning very well , " michael heise , chief economist at the allianz group said . heise added that the companies that rely on industrial exports , as many in germany do , often suffer worst during an economic downturn . " that 's what explains last year 's drop of 5 percent , which was much higher than in other countries , " he said , adding that when the economy is doing well , it translates to above average growth for german exporters . non-eu exports growing fastest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial exports that get hit hard in tough times tend to bounce back faster exports to outside of europe , with china , india and brazil leading the way , have been increasing twice as much as exports headed to european nations .
that has some in europe concerned since germany 's trade surpluses are creating deficits for its neighbors . french finance minister christine lagarde has said germany 's trade surpluses are due to the minimal salary hikes its workers get and can not be maintained over the long term .
similar statements have come from the united states , which would like to see germany do more to boost demand and cut its budget less . it 's a criticism heise said he can understand . " it 's essential that we increase domestic economic activity and demand in germany , " he said .
" that 's what foreign countries are demanding as our part in eliminating imbalances - and we 're going to have to show some that we 're doing something . " who has to change most ? the disagreement focuses on whether only southern europe 's less competitive nations have to change their policies or if well-off nations like germany should also do more to contribute to bringing economic balance back to europe .
even as the euro grows stronger against the dollar , germany was able to step up its exports between 2000 and 2008 by 65 percent .
that was largely because wages lagged behind productivity , which equated to a real devaluation for germans and kept up the country 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : views differ on which countries have to take measures to help the whole of europe now , with exports rising again , the united states has said germany , as well as other european nations , should foster the fledgling recovery with stimulus measures rather than slashing public spending .
but germany 's government has insisted it will not introduce new economic stimulus packages . " the strategy can not be that we start taking on more national debts and artificially expand state consumption , " heise said .
" we have to stimulate private consumption and investment demand . " he added that changing labor and employment policies , modifying the tax system and limiting bureaucracy would all contribute to evening out trade imbalances .
but there are also more radical measures being considered , some of which call for germany to give up some of its ability to compete . more german than the germans " it is absurd that germans advise their neighbors to copy german traits , " said martin wolf , chief economist at the financial times , adding that it would make more sense for germans to take on debt , boost pay and become more european . competitiveness is generally measured by unit labor costs .
the european statistics office indexed these costs using the year 2000 as its base .
nine years later , the index gives southern european nations a value of about 130 , france scored 118 and germany at 105 ; showing that most european countries have lost the fight for competitiveness to germany . and germany does not see any reason to turn back the clock on gains it has made . " we are not going to give up our strengths , " chancellor angela merkel said .
" that would be the wrong answer for our continent . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 23.07.2010 german courts are reluctant to abandon practice of preventive detention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german prisoners can remain in jail well after their original terms end under current german law , courts can rule to keep violent offenders imprisoned indefinitely .
the european court of human rights in strasburg has ruled this preventive detention is an affront to human rights . regional courts in germany are currently deciding individually on how to handle dangerous repeat offenders whose court sentences are up .
several months ago the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled against germany 's use of preventive detention in such cases , which it said was tantamount to post facto punishment .
under a 1998 law , german courts can rule to keep prisoners deemed to be societal threats under so-called " preventive detention " for an indefinite period after they have served their official sentences .
following the echr 's ruling , some german courts fell in line , but most decided to wait for the federal constitutional court to rule on the matter .
' not a form of punishment ' as many as 70 violent offenders may soon be released in accordance with the echr decision in the state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- alone .
these prisoners are the particularly questionable , so-called " old cases . "
they were sentenced to prison with the possibility of preventive detention before 1998 - when an amendment lifted a 10-year time limit on post-term detention .
in their cases , the new law was applied retroactively to keep them in jail after they had finished their actual prison terms and 10 years of post-term preventive detention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the echr in strasbourg says preventive detention goes against human rights in nrw the regional appeals court in the city of cologne is one of the many to uphold current german law despite the echr ruling .
court spokesman hubertus nolte told deutsche welle that under german law , " preventive detention is not a form of punishment " but " a safety measure for the general public , to protect the people against dangerous repeat offenders . "
a violation of the right to liberty the echr , however , views preventive detention as punitive , and in the case of reinhard m. versus germany , the echr ruled that the retroactive implementation of indefinite preventive detention was a violation of human rights .
in 1986 , reinhard m. was sentenced to 5 years in prison with the possibility of preventive detention . however , when 2001 came , the time when he was expecting to be released , a court retroactively applied the 1998 amendment to the criminal code that lifted the time limit on preventive detention - and reinhard m. remained behind bars .
in a ruling in may this year , the european court found that m. 's " continued preventive detention violated his right to liberty , " a court spokesperson told deutsche welle .
the court also ruled that the plaintiff 's further imprisonment was unlawful " in particular as there was not a sufficient causal connection between his conviction in 1986 and his continued detention , after the completion of ten years in preventive detention . "
dragging heels in germany thomas ullenbruch , a judge at the emmendingen circuit court , sees the decision in strasbourg as a call to action for german courts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is for more careful use of preventive detention instead , he says , they are only dragging their heels .
" although the decision from strasbourg was anything but surprising , an unprecedented chaos now reigns , " he told zdf television , adding that , " clear guidelines must be implemented in dozens of cases .
up till now very few people have been released and even the federal constitutional court has been putting the issue off . "
while some german regional courts have heeded the echr 's decision and have begun releasing " old case " prisoners , cologne 's court authorities have refused do so until there is a ruling on the matter from the federal constitutional court .
" our court , like other state courts in germany , is of the opinion that we ca n't simply apply the decision of the echr as if it were german law , " nolte said .
judges ' are n't psychics ' another issue at hand is the use of preventive detention in cases where it was not mentioned during sentencing at all .
germany 's federal minister of justice , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , does not wish to do away with preventive detention but said in an interview with zdf television that she wanted to see judges making use of it more often when first sentencing criminals , thus eliminating the need to impose it retroactively .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger 's stance has met with criticism from state-level justice authorities , especially in parts of the country ruled by conservatives from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bavaria 's minister of justice beate merk of the csu , sees one major " safety flaw " in limiting courts ' rights to keep dangerous criminals away from society : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merk says judges " are n't psychics " " our judges are n't psychics .
maybe the federal minister of justice thinks they are , but they are n't .
if during a prisoner 's term , new facts come to light and with them new insight , judges can only act then , " she said .
" for that scenario we need the ability to implement preventive custody retroactively . "
merk added that her state would not release any dangerous offenders unless ordered to do so by leutheusser-schnarrenberger 's ministry of justice .
until that occurs - if it does - courts in bavaria and all over germany will continue to hold repeat offenders in prison for as long as they see fit .

germany 's federal minister of justice , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , does not wish to do away with preventive detention but said in an interview with zdf television that she wanted to see judges making use of it more often when first sentencing criminals , thus eliminating the need to impose it retroactively .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger 's stance has met with criticism from state-level justice authorities , especially in parts of the country ruled by conservatives from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .

maybe the federal minister of justice thinks they are , but they are n't .
if during a prisoner 's term , new facts come to light and with them new insight , judges can only act then , " she said .
" for that scenario we need the ability to implement preventive custody retroactively . "
merk added that her state would not release any dangerous offenders unless ordered to do so by leutheusser-schnarrenberger 's ministry of justice .
until that occurs - if it does - courts in bavaria and all over germany will continue to hold repeat offenders in prison for as long as they see fit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 23.07.2010 german courts are reluctant to abandon practice of preventive detention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german prisoners can remain in jail well after their original terms end under current german law , courts can rule to keep violent offenders imprisoned indefinitely .
the european court of human rights in strasburg has ruled this preventive detention is an affront to human rights . regional courts in germany are currently deciding individually on how to handle dangerous repeat offenders whose court sentences are up .
several months ago the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled against germany 's use of preventive detention in such cases , which it said was tantamount to post facto punishment .
under a 1998 law , german courts can rule to keep prisoners deemed to be societal threats under so-called " preventive detention " for an indefinite period after they have served their official sentences .
following the echr 's ruling , some german courts fell in line , but most decided to wait for the federal constitutional court to rule on the matter .
' not a form of punishment ' as many as 70 violent offenders may soon be released in accordance with the echr decision in the state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- alone .
these prisoners are the particularly questionable , so-called " old cases . "
they were sentenced to prison with the possibility of preventive detention before 1998 - when an amendment lifted a 10-year time limit on post-term detention .
in their cases , the new law was applied retroactively to keep them in jail after they had finished their actual prison terms and 10 years of post-term preventive detention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the echr in strasbourg says preventive detention goes against human rights in nrw the regional appeals court in the city of cologne is one of the many to uphold current german law despite the echr ruling .
court spokesman hubertus nolte told deutsche welle that under german law , " preventive detention is not a form of punishment " but " a safety measure for the general public , to protect the people against dangerous repeat offenders . "
a violation of the right to liberty the echr , however , views preventive detention as punitive , and in the case of reinhard m. versus germany , the echr ruled that the retroactive implementation of indefinite preventive detention was a violation of human rights .
in 1986 , reinhard m. was sentenced to 5 years in prison with the possibility of preventive detention . however , when 2001 came , the time when he was expecting to be released , a court retroactively applied the 1998 amendment to the criminal code that lifted the time limit on preventive detention - and reinhard m. remained behind bars .
in a ruling in may this year , the european court found that m. 's " continued preventive detention violated his right to liberty , " a court spokesperson told deutsche welle .
the court also ruled that the plaintiff 's further imprisonment was unlawful " in particular as there was not a sufficient causal connection between his conviction in 1986 and his continued detention , after the completion of ten years in preventive detention . "
dragging heels in germany thomas ullenbruch , a judge at the emmendingen circuit court , sees the decision in strasbourg as a call to action for german courts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is for more careful use of preventive detention instead , he says , they are only dragging their heels .
" although the decision from strasbourg was anything but surprising , an unprecedented chaos now reigns , " he told zdf television , adding that , " clear guidelines must be implemented in dozens of cases .
up till now very few people have been released and even the federal constitutional court has been putting the issue off . "
while some german regional courts have heeded the echr 's decision and have begun releasing " old case " prisoners , cologne 's court authorities have refused do so until there is a ruling on the matter from the federal constitutional court .
" our court , like other state courts in germany , is of the opinion that we ca n't simply apply the decision of the echr as if it were german law , " nolte said .
judges ' are n't psychics ' another issue at hand is the use of preventive detention in cases where it was not mentioned during sentencing at all .
germany 's federal minister of justice , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , does not wish to do away with preventive detention but said in an interview with zdf television that she wanted to see judges making use of it more often when first sentencing criminals , thus eliminating the need to impose it retroactively .

until that occurs - if it does - courts in bavaria and all over germany will continue to hold repeat offenders in prison for as long as they see fit .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "
airbus says the deals it has either sealed or set up at the british air show will eventually be worth almost 22 billion euros , and the company is considering further increases in production of its smaller , single-aisle a320 family to cope with rising demand .

gains across the industry airbus 's strong sales were a welcome boon at farnborough , especially after the company 's us rival boeing flew in its new 787 dreamliner for its debut appearance outside the states .
the 787 is boeing 's answer to the airbus a380 superjumbo , and although it has a lower seating capacity and shorter range , many analysts predict its comparatively modest size could make it more saleable than airbus ' record-breaking passenger jet .
boeing has reported 103 new orders worth roughly eight billion euros at the trade fair , saying this performance points to a " continued recovery " for the industry .
aviation mogul steve udvar-hazy - a pioneer of the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s - also made a big-spending return in farnborough , ordering 100 airbus and boeing jets for his new business , air lease corp , triggering more orders from rival leasing companies .
airline shares have responded positively to the performance , although the apparent spike in sales is still being fuelled by emerging markets , with airlines in europe and north america relatively cautious .
sales at the biennial farnborough trade fair may not have approached the record levels of 2008 , when almost 70 billion euros changed hands , but they 're still a massive improvement on 2009 's post-financial crisis sister air show at le bourget , near paris , when sales totaled a meager 5.4 billion euros .

" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "
airbus says the deals it has either sealed or set up at the british air show will eventually be worth almost 22 billion euros , and the company is considering further increases in production of its smaller , single-aisle a320 family to cope with rising demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' a380 is the new flagship , but not the cash cow " this was a good airshow for us and i think it was a good airshow for the aviation industry , " airbus chief executive thomas enders said on thursday , after the last major day for doing business at the farnborough show , which remains open to the public until sunday .
gains across the industry airbus 's strong sales were a welcome boon at farnborough , especially after the company 's us rival boeing flew in its new 787 dreamliner for its debut appearance outside the states .
the 787 is boeing 's answer to the airbus a380 superjumbo , and although it has a lower seating capacity and shorter range , many analysts predict its comparatively modest size could make it more saleable than airbus ' record-breaking passenger jet .
boeing has reported 103 new orders worth roughly eight billion euros at the trade fair , saying this performance points to a " continued recovery " for the industry .
aviation mogul steve udvar-hazy - a pioneer of the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s - also made a big-spending return in farnborough , ordering 100 airbus and boeing jets for his new business , air lease corp , triggering more orders from rival leasing companies .
airline shares have responded positively to the performance , although the apparent spike in sales is still being fuelled by emerging markets , with airlines in europe and north america relatively cautious .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.07.2010 seven european banks fail eu stress tests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european markets will rise or fall on the test results european banking regulators have released the results of their so-called stress tests .
many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

doubts surface over eu bank stress tests on friday regulators release the results of " stress tests " carried out on banks to determine their health .
but markets are worried that the results wo n't mean much since the tests may not have been rigorous enough .

german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

the call comes as the oil spill in the gulf of mexico near its 15th week . with the bp oil spill fiasco in the gulf of mexico entering its fourth month , germany 's environment minister , norbert roettgen , has called for a moratorium on new oil drilling in the north sea .
roettgen said the measure should be taken until an investigation can determine exactly what went wrong in the oil rig explosion that led to the spill off the united states coast , which has become the country 's worst-ever environmental disaster .
" we take risks , but we ca n't take every risk , " roettgen told public broadcaster zdf .
" without safety there can be no drilling . "
roettgen said , however , he doubted that other north sea countries would go along with a moratorium .
he added that environmental and safety standards applied to north sea drilling operations differed from those used in the united states .
countries straddling the north sea include norway , denmark , the netherlands , belgium , france , britain and germany .
the calls by the german environment minister come two weeks after european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger called for a halt on deep sea drilling - a demand that was rebuffed by a number of eu states , including the uk .
individual eu member states are responsible for approving or rejecting drilling proposals in their own waters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2010 when it gets too hot in berlin , it 's time to head to brandenburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that the 30-something , latte-drinking generation has finished colonizing central berlin , it 's set its sights on the backwaters of brandenburg .
jane paulick wonders if the provinces got the short end of the stick . it 's been eye-meltingly hot in berlin for the last few weeks , and everyone who can is escaping the city whenever they have a free moment .
as luck would have it , receding ice age glaciers left literally hundreds of lakes scattered around the brandenburg countryside outside berlin , and this summer , i 've been struck by the growing number of people who 've acquired their own private waterside retreat . brandenburg , it seems , is to berlin what the hamptons are to new york - only it 's not , because a summer house on long island is a luxury financially far beyond the reach of mere mortals , whereas a dacha in the hinterlands of the german capital can still be had for a song . so while i 've been kidding myself that the city 's many outdoor swimming pools are actually quite nice places to be on my days off - despite the fact they 're overrun by teenage gangs and there are fries and fag-ends floating in the water - most long-time berlin residents simply would n't dream of spending a weekend in the city . feudal fantasies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise on berlin 's doorstep it 's not that surprising that so many of the ossis -lrb- east germans -rrb- i know own country abodes .
many of them inherited houses from their parents or grandparents , while others who grew up with brandenburg on their doorstep were snapping up bijou property bargains in its untamed , sunflower-filled lowlands long before these reached the radars of the hordes of west germans who only moved to berlin in the last decade . until recently , these denizens of hip neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg , mitte and kreuzberg would n't have set foot in the prussian provinces .
but it seems there 's been a shift in perceptions , and brandenburg is no longer considered such a final frontier . my suspicions were confirmed when , last week on the tram , i saw someone reading a book by swiss tv personality dieter moor about his attempts to run an organic farm near werneuchen , northeast of berlin - and later that day while flicking through the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , i noticed it was number three on its bestseller list . then there 's cabaret singer rainald grebe , currently satirizing urbanites ' sudden love affair with what used to be the badlands of brandenburg in his new show at the maxim gorki theater called " back to nature . " his conclusion is that it 's just another form of consumerism . " these fantasies of bucolic living are nothing more than complete greediness , " he said in a recent interview with berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine tip .
not that he 's blameless - he also dreams of the simple life . " it 's about having it all ; living in the city ; being networked and having your finger on the pulse - but also having a house in the country .
it 's not as though i actually want to weed , milk cows and grow tomatoes , " continued grebe , " it 's just some feudal fantasy of being a landowner lording it over the locals .
all i really want to do is sit in the sun , drink a latte macchiato and enjoy a view of a lake . " pastoral paradise sounds good to me .
never immune to the vagaries of fashion , i too have started dreaming of a lakeside getaway i might call my own . my first step has been to overcome some prejudices . admittedly , brandenburg does n't have the best of reputations . it 's associated first and foremost with neo-nazis , failed industry and a mass exodus of young people and doctors - and after several weekends spent driving around scouting for empty property , i can personally confirm there really are no doctors : one day when i realized i had an inflamed tick bite , i was sent by the friends i was visiting to get an antibiotics prescription from a veterinarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " was filmed on location in brandenburg as for the neo-nazis , i 'm assured by the same friends that the locals are salt of the earth and highly unlikely to vote far-right .
fair point .
state elections last september actually saw more than two thirds of the population vote either for the social democrats , the left party or the greens , and the region 's most famous daughter is none other than the ever-moderate chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in templin . other exemplary brandenburgers include 19th-century writer theodor fontane - who paid its rural charms loving tribute in his novels - and prussia 's most famous architect , karl friedrich schinkel , who left his mark in the form of countless palaces , villas and village churches . of yuppies and yokels if you 've seen michael hanecke 's oscar-nominated 2009 movie " the white ribbon , " then you know what a brandenburg village looks like : wide , cobblestone avenues that time seems to have forgotten , lined with chestnut trees and low farmhouses dating back at least 100 years . needless to say , it 's this historic , pre-communist architecture that appeals to berliners seeking scenic rustic tranquility , many of whom i 've encountered at the various public viewings of houses for sale that i 've attended in the last few months .
i 've even seen people i recognize from my local organic supermarket , although i 've never seen anyone who looks like they might be interested in buying something more permanent than a holiday home . few people want to live in brandenburg full-time .
one property valuation report i leafed through referred to the mass unemployment and inadequate infrastructure that characterize the region .
none of these factors matter much to the affluent berliners who can jump back in their suvs on sunday night after a relaxing few days in their converted barns . they ca n't be accused of pricing out locals , because locals are leaving in droves anyway .
but the way these townies are colonizing the countryside is a little unpalatable .
it 's obvious what 's in for them - but what 's in it for brandenburg ?
i hope that sooner or later , it might at least start to reap some benefits from gentrification - even the g-word would be better than defunct train stations and empty school yards . author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 23.07.2010 german courts are reluctant to abandon practice of preventive detention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german prisoners can remain in jail well after their original terms end under current german law , courts can rule to keep violent offenders imprisoned indefinitely .
the european court of human rights in strasburg has ruled this preventive detention is an affront to human rights . regional courts in germany are currently deciding individually on how to handle dangerous repeat offenders whose court sentences are up .
several months ago the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- ruled against germany 's use of preventive detention in such cases , which it said was tantamount to post facto punishment .
under a 1998 law , german courts can rule to keep prisoners deemed to be societal threats under so-called " preventive detention " for an indefinite period after they have served their official sentences .
following the echr 's ruling , some german courts fell in line , but most decided to wait for the federal constitutional court to rule on the matter .
' not a form of punishment ' as many as 70 violent offenders may soon be released in accordance with the echr decision in the state of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- alone .
these prisoners are the particularly questionable , so-called " old cases . "
they were sentenced to prison with the possibility of preventive detention before 1998 - when an amendment lifted a 10-year time limit on post-term detention .
in their cases , the new law was applied retroactively to keep them in jail after they had finished their actual prison terms and 10 years of post-term preventive detention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the echr in strasbourg says preventive detention goes against human rights in nrw the regional appeals court in the city of cologne is one of the many to uphold current german law despite the echr ruling .
court spokesman hubertus nolte told deutsche welle that under german law , " preventive detention is not a form of punishment " but " a safety measure for the general public , to protect the people against dangerous repeat offenders . "
a violation of the right to liberty the echr , however , views preventive detention as punitive , and in the case of reinhard m. versus germany , the echr ruled that the retroactive implementation of indefinite preventive detention was a violation of human rights .
in 1986 , reinhard m. was sentenced to 5 years in prison with the possibility of preventive detention . however , when 2001 came , the time when he was expecting to be released , a court retroactively applied the 1998 amendment to the criminal code that lifted the time limit on preventive detention - and reinhard m. remained behind bars .
in a ruling in may this year , the european court found that m. 's " continued preventive detention violated his right to liberty , " a court spokesperson told deutsche welle .
the court also ruled that the plaintiff 's further imprisonment was unlawful " in particular as there was not a sufficient causal connection between his conviction in 1986 and his continued detention , after the completion of ten years in preventive detention . "
dragging heels in germany thomas ullenbruch , a judge at the emmendingen circuit court , sees the decision in strasbourg as a call to action for german courts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is for more careful use of preventive detention instead , he says , they are only dragging their heels .
" although the decision from strasbourg was anything but surprising , an unprecedented chaos now reigns , " he told zdf television , adding that , " clear guidelines must be implemented in dozens of cases .
up till now very few people have been released and even the federal constitutional court has been putting the issue off . "
while some german regional courts have heeded the echr 's decision and have begun releasing " old case " prisoners , cologne 's court authorities have refused do so until there is a ruling on the matter from the federal constitutional court .
" our court , like other state courts in germany , is of the opinion that we ca n't simply apply the decision of the echr as if it were german law , " nolte said .
judges ' are n't psychics ' another issue at hand is the use of preventive detention in cases where it was not mentioned during sentencing at all .
germany 's federal minister of justice , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , does not wish to do away with preventive detention but said in an interview with zdf television that she wanted to see judges making use of it more often when first sentencing criminals , thus eliminating the need to impose it retroactively .
leutheusser-schnarrenberger 's stance has met with criticism from state-level justice authorities , especially in parts of the country ruled by conservatives from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bavaria 's minister of justice beate merk of the csu , sees one major " safety flaw " in limiting courts ' rights to keep dangerous criminals away from society : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merk says judges " are n't psychics " " our judges are n't psychics .
maybe the federal minister of justice thinks they are , but they are n't .
if during a prisoner 's term , new facts come to light and with them new insight , judges can only act then , " she said .
" for that scenario we need the ability to implement preventive custody retroactively . "
merk added that her state would not release any dangerous offenders unless ordered to do so by leutheusser-schnarrenberger 's ministry of justice .
until that occurs - if it does - courts in bavaria and all over germany will continue to hold repeat offenders in prison for as long as they see fit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .

the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 23.07.2010 oil company fined over ivory coast toxic dump großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura concealed the harmful nature of the waste , the court found a dutch court has fined oil firm trafigura one million euros for violating european laws on the export of waste , four years after the company dumped toxic waste meant to remain in amsterdam in ivory coast . swiss-based oil company trafigura was fined one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- on friday by an amsterdam court for violating eu laws on the export of hazardous waste , which the un says killed at least 15 people and forced thousands to be hospitalized in 2006 .
the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

of late she has been complaining of breathlessness .
she knows it could be the result of asbestos-related ailments and if untreated could possibly lead to lung cancer and skin diseases .
but shashwati says she has no option but to continue living in her house made of this dangerous material .
" for years now i have been living under a roof made of asbestos .
and so are the doors .
of late when i close the door , i feel a problem in my breathing .
but what shall i do ?
we are poor , and where can we go ?
i know of the bad effects of asbestos especially when particles fall . "
rise in asbestos use the indian asbestos industry generates more than $ 850 million a year in revenue , and directly employs 300,000 people ; indirectly , it supports as many as 3 million more .
backed by a powerful lobby , asbestos use in india has risen by 83 percent since 2004 , according to government figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at an asbestos mine in udaipur , india given evidence of poor workplace safety and weak regulations , such widespread use could prove disastrous , say health experts .
asbestos products carry no health warning labels and trade unions have no mandate to prevent asbestos-related disease at workplaces .
indian consumers are also unlikely to know that as asbestos-cement erodes and crumbles , dangerous fibers are released .
" even if a single fiber is inhaled , it is capable of causing mesothelioma , and that has been proven by epidemiological as well clinical and experimental studies , " says dr sanjay chaturvedi , a professor of community medicine .
" we have to preclude all possible release of asbestos in the environment wherever there is a possibility of human exposure . "
hazardous effects research has shown that worldwide , at least 90,000 people die every year from illnesses resulting from occupational exposure to asbestos .
however , this number only takes into account workers and ex-workers who have been identified with asbestos-related lung cancer , mesothelioma , and asbestosis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an asbestos mine worker in andhra pradesh , india gopal krishna , who heads the ban asbestos network of india , says as the market is growing at a tremendous pace , nobody in india has time to deal with complaints .
" there is an incestuous relationship between the asbestos manufacturing industry in india , the government and the political parties .
that incestuous relationship has led to it being supported .
in india we have some 300 medical colleges .
none of them has the competence to diagnose the diseases caused by asbestos .
so lack of documentation does not mean a lack of a problem in india .
the rate of consumption of asbestos is rising at an alarming rate , so are the diseases caused by asbestos . "
but as the indian states and union territories have no mechanism to prove that lung cancer deaths and other skin diseases are being caused by asbestos exposures , the indian asbestos industry could not care less about global efforts to ban the material everywhere including india . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.07.2010 with one exception , german banks pass financial stress test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were good for most german banks germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed the so-called stress test to see if it could survive a future financial crisis .
the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.07.2010 with one exception , german banks pass financial stress test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were good for most german banks germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed the so-called stress test to see if it could survive a future financial crisis .
the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.07.2010 italian autonomous car to drive from italy to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car will travel about 13,000 kilometers -lrb- 8,100 miles -rrb- between italy and china university of parma scientists have pioneered robotic cars that can navigate on their own .
they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .
there is nothing they could do more , says carl thayer , an expert on the southeast asian affairs at the australian defense force academy . " the asean regional forum can take no position that is compulsory on all members .
and asean individual states feel it -lrb- cheonan -rrb- is a bilateral issue and they usually abhor using force and threats that they see the us is applying . " delegates also discussed myanmar 's political process and human rights situation . according to janos martonyi , the hungarian foreign minister , myanmar is at a crossroads .
he called on the country to hold fair elections and release political prisoners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean foreign minister park ui chun myanmar and south china sea the us , on the other hand also raised concerns over myanmar 's alleged nuclear activities .
on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .

this year it seems especially bad .
the affected area is almost the size of germany and even visible from outer space .
it appears like a gigantic foul-smelling carpet , 377 000 square kilometers in size , spreading from finland to the german-polish border and to the island of ruegen .
it is the biggest algae explosion since 2005 .
a combination of farming and weather bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wwf says current conditions are ' perfect ' for algae growth it 's not just the sunny weather which is driving the bloom .
it 's also the large quantity of phosphorus in the water .
" over-fertilization is the biggest environmental problem facing the baltic , " said jochen lamp from the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in hamburg .
the phosphates are being washed off farmland and from rivers into the baltic sea .
wwf has criticized countries bordering on the baltic for their disjointed response to the problem .
on the one hand they seem eager to reduce over-fertilization , on the other they encourage farmers to use more fertilizers .
sweden for example has abolished its tax on fertilizers and in the north-eastern part of germany , in mecklenburg-western pomerania , farmers are now allowed to manure their land within a meter of dikes and creeks - it used to be seven meters .
algae cause death zones in the water algae blooms can be disastrous for ecoystems , causing dead zones under water .
they suck up the oxygen , leaving none for plants and animals .
" this is especially bad for fish , crawfish , starfish and crabs living in the ground .
their lives are severely affected and in the worst case they die , " says wera leujak , specialist for oceanic security at the german federal environment agency .
the baltic sea already has quite a number of these dead zones , but the algae exacerbate them .
for humans , the blue-green algae are unhealthy as well .
they can cause skin rashes , allergic reactions or diarrhoea and damage the liver .
bildunterschrift : the blue-green algae bloom can even be seen from space clear water , clear samples yet despite a media uproar in europe this week , the situation is not that much worse than normal .
on thursday , a research ship took water samples from the baltic sea on the west coast of ruegen .
" at least for this area , we can give the all-clear , " said harald stegemann , head of the state environmental office for mecklenburg-western pomerania in guestrow , who initiated the operation .
" the samples looked like tap water and the colleagues on board did n't see any algae carpets , although we expected it to be different . "
on other parts of the baltic sea algae are visible .
" there are these tiny little algae floating around and colouring the water green and yellowish , " said thomas merck .
he works on the small island of vilm near ruegen and has lived there for a couple of years now .
" speaking from experience , all i can say is : it just happens regularly . "
algae comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , beaches have stayed open - with a bit of rain the algae may even disappear .
for this reason , local scientists are reluctant to join the hysteria .
of course the area looks huge on satellite images .
" but the important question is : is it just a film of two or three millimeters or is it a real carpet of two or three centimeters ? "
stegemann explains .
for him , it does not seem to be very dramatic , though he concedes that sufficient data has not yet been gathered to dismiss the problem out of hand .
in any event , the carpet may well disappear during the next few days anyway : " if it cools down , if it gets stormy , if it rains , the water will intermingle and it 's all over , " stegemann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 23.07.2010 booming exports worry germany 's neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : containers are once again rolling out of germany german exports are booming , and it 's as if the economic crisis almost never happened .
but criticism of germany 's economic model is growing louder as experts call on germans to stimulate domestic demand . until recently , german exports were suffering due to the economic crisis , but those days are nearly forgotten , and exports are taking off again .
statistics showed that the country 's exports recovered twice as much as expected in may .
goods worth 77.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- left germany 's borders , which represents an increase of nearly 30 percent compared to last year . " germany 's export model is functioning very well , " michael heise , chief economist at the allianz group said . heise added that the companies that rely on industrial exports , as many in germany do , often suffer worst during an economic downturn . " that 's what explains last year 's drop of 5 percent , which was much higher than in other countries , " he said , adding that when the economy is doing well , it translates to above average growth for german exporters . non-eu exports growing fastest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial exports that get hit hard in tough times tend to bounce back faster exports to outside of europe , with china , india and brazil leading the way , have been increasing twice as much as exports headed to european nations .
that has some in europe concerned since germany 's trade surpluses are creating deficits for its neighbors . french finance minister christine lagarde has said germany 's trade surpluses are due to the minimal salary hikes its workers get and can not be maintained over the long term .
similar statements have come from the united states , which would like to see germany do more to boost demand and cut its budget less . it 's a criticism heise said he can understand . " it 's essential that we increase domestic economic activity and demand in germany , " he said .
" that 's what foreign countries are demanding as our part in eliminating imbalances - and we 're going to have to show some that we 're doing something . " who has to change most ? the disagreement focuses on whether only southern europe 's less competitive nations have to change their policies or if well-off nations like germany should also do more to contribute to bringing economic balance back to europe .
even as the euro grows stronger against the dollar , germany was able to step up its exports between 2000 and 2008 by 65 percent .
that was largely because wages lagged behind productivity , which equated to a real devaluation for germans and kept up the country 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : views differ on which countries have to take measures to help the whole of europe now , with exports rising again , the united states has said germany , as well as other european nations , should foster the fledgling recovery with stimulus measures rather than slashing public spending .
but germany 's government has insisted it will not introduce new economic stimulus packages . " the strategy can not be that we start taking on more national debts and artificially expand state consumption , " heise said .
" we have to stimulate private consumption and investment demand . " he added that changing labor and employment policies , modifying the tax system and limiting bureaucracy would all contribute to evening out trade imbalances .
but there are also more radical measures being considered , some of which call for germany to give up some of its ability to compete . more german than the germans " it is absurd that germans advise their neighbors to copy german traits , " said martin wolf , chief economist at the financial times , adding that it would make more sense for germans to take on debt , boost pay and become more european . competitiveness is generally measured by unit labor costs .
the european statistics office indexed these costs using the year 2000 as its base .
nine years later , the index gives southern european nations a value of about 130 , france scored 118 and germany at 105 ; showing that most european countries have lost the fight for competitiveness to germany . and germany does not see any reason to turn back the clock on gains it has made . " we are not going to give up our strengths , " chancellor angela merkel said .
" that would be the wrong answer for our continent . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jane paulick wonders if the provinces got the short end of the stick . it 's been eye-meltingly hot in berlin for the last few weeks , and everyone who can is escaping the city whenever they have a free moment .
as luck would have it , receding ice age glaciers left literally hundreds of lakes scattered around the brandenburg countryside outside berlin , and this summer , i 've been struck by the growing number of people who 've acquired their own private waterside retreat . brandenburg , it seems , is to berlin what the hamptons are to new york - only it 's not , because a summer house on long island is a luxury financially far beyond the reach of mere mortals , whereas a dacha in the hinterlands of the german capital can still be had for a song . so while i 've been kidding myself that the city 's many outdoor swimming pools are actually quite nice places to be on my days off - despite the fact they 're overrun by teenage gangs and there are fries and fag-ends floating in the water - most long-time berlin residents simply would n't dream of spending a weekend in the city . feudal fantasies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise on berlin 's doorstep it 's not that surprising that so many of the ossis -lrb- east germans -rrb- i know own country abodes .
many of them inherited houses from their parents or grandparents , while others who grew up with brandenburg on their doorstep were snapping up bijou property bargains in its untamed , sunflower-filled lowlands long before these reached the radars of the hordes of west germans who only moved to berlin in the last decade . until recently , these denizens of hip neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg , mitte and kreuzberg would n't have set foot in the prussian provinces .
but it seems there 's been a shift in perceptions , and brandenburg is no longer considered such a final frontier . my suspicions were confirmed when , last week on the tram , i saw someone reading a book by swiss tv personality dieter moor about his attempts to run an organic farm near werneuchen , northeast of berlin - and later that day while flicking through the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , i noticed it was number three on its bestseller list . then there 's cabaret singer rainald grebe , currently satirizing urbanites ' sudden love affair with what used to be the badlands of brandenburg in his new show at the maxim gorki theater called " back to nature . " his conclusion is that it 's just another form of consumerism . " these fantasies of bucolic living are nothing more than complete greediness , " he said in a recent interview with berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine tip .
not that he 's blameless - he also dreams of the simple life . " it 's about having it all ; living in the city ; being networked and having your finger on the pulse - but also having a house in the country .
it 's not as though i actually want to weed , milk cows and grow tomatoes , " continued grebe , " it 's just some feudal fantasy of being a landowner lording it over the locals .
all i really want to do is sit in the sun , drink a latte macchiato and enjoy a view of a lake . " pastoral paradise sounds good to me .
never immune to the vagaries of fashion , i too have started dreaming of a lakeside getaway i might call my own . my first step has been to overcome some prejudices . admittedly , brandenburg does n't have the best of reputations . it 's associated first and foremost with neo-nazis , failed industry and a mass exodus of young people and doctors - and after several weekends spent driving around scouting for empty property , i can personally confirm there really are no doctors : one day when i realized i had an inflamed tick bite , i was sent by the friends i was visiting to get an antibiotics prescription from a veterinarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " was filmed on location in brandenburg as for the neo-nazis , i 'm assured by the same friends that the locals are salt of the earth and highly unlikely to vote far-right .
fair point .
state elections last september actually saw more than two thirds of the population vote either for the social democrats , the left party or the greens , and the region 's most famous daughter is none other than the ever-moderate chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in templin . other exemplary brandenburgers include 19th-century writer theodor fontane - who paid its rural charms loving tribute in his novels - and prussia 's most famous architect , karl friedrich schinkel , who left his mark in the form of countless palaces , villas and village churches . of yuppies and yokels if you 've seen michael hanecke 's oscar-nominated 2009 movie " the white ribbon , " then you know what a brandenburg village looks like : wide , cobblestone avenues that time seems to have forgotten , lined with chestnut trees and low farmhouses dating back at least 100 years . needless to say , it 's this historic , pre-communist architecture that appeals to berliners seeking scenic rustic tranquility , many of whom i 've encountered at the various public viewings of houses for sale that i 've attended in the last few months .
i 've even seen people i recognize from my local organic supermarket , although i 've never seen anyone who looks like they might be interested in buying something more permanent than a holiday home . few people want to live in brandenburg full-time .
one property valuation report i leafed through referred to the mass unemployment and inadequate infrastructure that characterize the region .
none of these factors matter much to the affluent berliners who can jump back in their suvs on sunday night after a relaxing few days in their converted barns . they ca n't be accused of pricing out locals , because locals are leaving in droves anyway .
but the way these townies are colonizing the countryside is a little unpalatable .
it 's obvious what 's in for them - but what 's in it for brandenburg ?
i hope that sooner or later , it might at least start to reap some benefits from gentrification - even the g-word would be better than defunct train stations and empty school yards . author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jane paulick wonders if the provinces got the short end of the stick . it 's been eye-meltingly hot in berlin for the last few weeks , and everyone who can is escaping the city whenever they have a free moment .
as luck would have it , receding ice age glaciers left literally hundreds of lakes scattered around the brandenburg countryside outside berlin , and this summer , i 've been struck by the growing number of people who 've acquired their own private waterside retreat . brandenburg , it seems , is to berlin what the hamptons are to new york - only it 's not , because a summer house on long island is a luxury financially far beyond the reach of mere mortals , whereas a dacha in the hinterlands of the german capital can still be had for a song . so while i 've been kidding myself that the city 's many outdoor swimming pools are actually quite nice places to be on my days off - despite the fact they 're overrun by teenage gangs and there are fries and fag-ends floating in the water - most long-time berlin residents simply would n't dream of spending a weekend in the city . feudal fantasies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise on berlin 's doorstep it 's not that surprising that so many of the ossis -lrb- east germans -rrb- i know own country abodes .
many of them inherited houses from their parents or grandparents , while others who grew up with brandenburg on their doorstep were snapping up bijou property bargains in its untamed , sunflower-filled lowlands long before these reached the radars of the hordes of west germans who only moved to berlin in the last decade . until recently , these denizens of hip neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg , mitte and kreuzberg would n't have set foot in the prussian provinces .
but it seems there 's been a shift in perceptions , and brandenburg is no longer considered such a final frontier . my suspicions were confirmed when , last week on the tram , i saw someone reading a book by swiss tv personality dieter moor about his attempts to run an organic farm near werneuchen , northeast of berlin - and later that day while flicking through the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , i noticed it was number three on its bestseller list . then there 's cabaret singer rainald grebe , currently satirizing urbanites ' sudden love affair with what used to be the badlands of brandenburg in his new show at the maxim gorki theater called " back to nature . " his conclusion is that it 's just another form of consumerism . " these fantasies of bucolic living are nothing more than complete greediness , " he said in a recent interview with berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine tip .
not that he 's blameless - he also dreams of the simple life . " it 's about having it all ; living in the city ; being networked and having your finger on the pulse - but also having a house in the country .
it 's not as though i actually want to weed , milk cows and grow tomatoes , " continued grebe , " it 's just some feudal fantasy of being a landowner lording it over the locals .
all i really want to do is sit in the sun , drink a latte macchiato and enjoy a view of a lake . " pastoral paradise sounds good to me .
never immune to the vagaries of fashion , i too have started dreaming of a lakeside getaway i might call my own . my first step has been to overcome some prejudices . admittedly , brandenburg does n't have the best of reputations . it 's associated first and foremost with neo-nazis , failed industry and a mass exodus of young people and doctors - and after several weekends spent driving around scouting for empty property , i can personally confirm there really are no doctors : one day when i realized i had an inflamed tick bite , i was sent by the friends i was visiting to get an antibiotics prescription from a veterinarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " was filmed on location in brandenburg as for the neo-nazis , i 'm assured by the same friends that the locals are salt of the earth and highly unlikely to vote far-right .
fair point .
state elections last september actually saw more than two thirds of the population vote either for the social democrats , the left party or the greens , and the region 's most famous daughter is none other than the ever-moderate chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in templin . other exemplary brandenburgers include 19th-century writer theodor fontane - who paid its rural charms loving tribute in his novels - and prussia 's most famous architect , karl friedrich schinkel , who left his mark in the form of countless palaces , villas and village churches . of yuppies and yokels if you 've seen michael hanecke 's oscar-nominated 2009 movie " the white ribbon , " then you know what a brandenburg village looks like : wide , cobblestone avenues that time seems to have forgotten , lined with chestnut trees and low farmhouses dating back at least 100 years . needless to say , it 's this historic , pre-communist architecture that appeals to berliners seeking scenic rustic tranquility , many of whom i 've encountered at the various public viewings of houses for sale that i 've attended in the last few months .
i 've even seen people i recognize from my local organic supermarket , although i 've never seen anyone who looks like they might be interested in buying something more permanent than a holiday home . few people want to live in brandenburg full-time .
one property valuation report i leafed through referred to the mass unemployment and inadequate infrastructure that characterize the region .
none of these factors matter much to the affluent berliners who can jump back in their suvs on sunday night after a relaxing few days in their converted barns . they ca n't be accused of pricing out locals , because locals are leaving in droves anyway .
but the way these townies are colonizing the countryside is a little unpalatable .
it 's obvious what 's in for them - but what 's in it for brandenburg ?
i hope that sooner or later , it might at least start to reap some benefits from gentrification - even the g-word would be better than defunct train stations and empty school yards . author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but criticism of germany 's economic model is growing louder as experts call on germans to stimulate domestic demand . until recently , german exports were suffering due to the economic crisis , but those days are nearly forgotten , and exports are taking off again .
statistics showed that the country 's exports recovered twice as much as expected in may .
goods worth 77.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- left germany 's borders , which represents an increase of nearly 30 percent compared to last year . " germany 's export model is functioning very well , " michael heise , chief economist at the allianz group said . heise added that the companies that rely on industrial exports , as many in germany do , often suffer worst during an economic downturn . " that 's what explains last year 's drop of 5 percent , which was much higher than in other countries , " he said , adding that when the economy is doing well , it translates to above average growth for german exporters . non-eu exports growing fastest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial exports that get hit hard in tough times tend to bounce back faster exports to outside of europe , with china , india and brazil leading the way , have been increasing twice as much as exports headed to european nations .
that has some in europe concerned since germany 's trade surpluses are creating deficits for its neighbors . french finance minister christine lagarde has said germany 's trade surpluses are due to the minimal salary hikes its workers get and can not be maintained over the long term .
similar statements have come from the united states , which would like to see germany do more to boost demand and cut its budget less . it 's a criticism heise said he can understand . " it 's essential that we increase domestic economic activity and demand in germany , " he said .
" that 's what foreign countries are demanding as our part in eliminating imbalances - and we 're going to have to show some that we 're doing something . " who has to change most ? the disagreement focuses on whether only southern europe 's less competitive nations have to change their policies or if well-off nations like germany should also do more to contribute to bringing economic balance back to europe .
even as the euro grows stronger against the dollar , germany was able to step up its exports between 2000 and 2008 by 65 percent .
that was largely because wages lagged behind productivity , which equated to a real devaluation for germans and kept up the country 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : views differ on which countries have to take measures to help the whole of europe now , with exports rising again , the united states has said germany , as well as other european nations , should foster the fledgling recovery with stimulus measures rather than slashing public spending .
but germany 's government has insisted it will not introduce new economic stimulus packages . " the strategy can not be that we start taking on more national debts and artificially expand state consumption , " heise said .
" we have to stimulate private consumption and investment demand . " he added that changing labor and employment policies , modifying the tax system and limiting bureaucracy would all contribute to evening out trade imbalances .
but there are also more radical measures being considered , some of which call for germany to give up some of its ability to compete . more german than the germans " it is absurd that germans advise their neighbors to copy german traits , " said martin wolf , chief economist at the financial times , adding that it would make more sense for germans to take on debt , boost pay and become more european . competitiveness is generally measured by unit labor costs .
the european statistics office indexed these costs using the year 2000 as its base .
nine years later , the index gives southern european nations a value of about 130 , france scored 118 and germany at 105 ; showing that most european countries have lost the fight for competitiveness to germany . and germany does not see any reason to turn back the clock on gains it has made .

jane paulick wonders if the provinces got the short end of the stick . it 's been eye-meltingly hot in berlin for the last few weeks , and everyone who can is escaping the city whenever they have a free moment .
as luck would have it , receding ice age glaciers left literally hundreds of lakes scattered around the brandenburg countryside outside berlin , and this summer , i 've been struck by the growing number of people who 've acquired their own private waterside retreat . brandenburg , it seems , is to berlin what the hamptons are to new york - only it 's not , because a summer house on long island is a luxury financially far beyond the reach of mere mortals , whereas a dacha in the hinterlands of the german capital can still be had for a song . so while i 've been kidding myself that the city 's many outdoor swimming pools are actually quite nice places to be on my days off - despite the fact they 're overrun by teenage gangs and there are fries and fag-ends floating in the water - most long-time berlin residents simply would n't dream of spending a weekend in the city . feudal fantasies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise on berlin 's doorstep it 's not that surprising that so many of the ossis -lrb- east germans -rrb- i know own country abodes .
many of them inherited houses from their parents or grandparents , while others who grew up with brandenburg on their doorstep were snapping up bijou property bargains in its untamed , sunflower-filled lowlands long before these reached the radars of the hordes of west germans who only moved to berlin in the last decade . until recently , these denizens of hip neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg , mitte and kreuzberg would n't have set foot in the prussian provinces .
but it seems there 's been a shift in perceptions , and brandenburg is no longer considered such a final frontier . my suspicions were confirmed when , last week on the tram , i saw someone reading a book by swiss tv personality dieter moor about his attempts to run an organic farm near werneuchen , northeast of berlin - and later that day while flicking through the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , i noticed it was number three on its bestseller list . then there 's cabaret singer rainald grebe , currently satirizing urbanites ' sudden love affair with what used to be the badlands of brandenburg in his new show at the maxim gorki theater called " back to nature . " his conclusion is that it 's just another form of consumerism . " these fantasies of bucolic living are nothing more than complete greediness , " he said in a recent interview with berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine tip .
not that he 's blameless - he also dreams of the simple life . " it 's about having it all ; living in the city ; being networked and having your finger on the pulse - but also having a house in the country .
it 's not as though i actually want to weed , milk cows and grow tomatoes , " continued grebe , " it 's just some feudal fantasy of being a landowner lording it over the locals .
all i really want to do is sit in the sun , drink a latte macchiato and enjoy a view of a lake . " pastoral paradise sounds good to me .
never immune to the vagaries of fashion , i too have started dreaming of a lakeside getaway i might call my own . my first step has been to overcome some prejudices . admittedly , brandenburg does n't have the best of reputations . it 's associated first and foremost with neo-nazis , failed industry and a mass exodus of young people and doctors - and after several weekends spent driving around scouting for empty property , i can personally confirm there really are no doctors : one day when i realized i had an inflamed tick bite , i was sent by the friends i was visiting to get an antibiotics prescription from a veterinarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " was filmed on location in brandenburg as for the neo-nazis , i 'm assured by the same friends that the locals are salt of the earth and highly unlikely to vote far-right .
fair point .
state elections last september actually saw more than two thirds of the population vote either for the social democrats , the left party or the greens , and the region 's most famous daughter is none other than the ever-moderate chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in templin . other exemplary brandenburgers include 19th-century writer theodor fontane - who paid its rural charms loving tribute in his novels - and prussia 's most famous architect , karl friedrich schinkel , who left his mark in the form of countless palaces , villas and village churches . of yuppies and yokels if you 've seen michael hanecke 's oscar-nominated 2009 movie " the white ribbon , " then you know what a brandenburg village looks like : wide , cobblestone avenues that time seems to have forgotten , lined with chestnut trees and low farmhouses dating back at least 100 years . needless to say , it 's this historic , pre-communist architecture that appeals to berliners seeking scenic rustic tranquility , many of whom i 've encountered at the various public viewings of houses for sale that i 've attended in the last few months .
i 've even seen people i recognize from my local organic supermarket , although i 've never seen anyone who looks like they might be interested in buying something more permanent than a holiday home . few people want to live in brandenburg full-time .
one property valuation report i leafed through referred to the mass unemployment and inadequate infrastructure that characterize the region .
none of these factors matter much to the affluent berliners who can jump back in their suvs on sunday night after a relaxing few days in their converted barns . they ca n't be accused of pricing out locals , because locals are leaving in droves anyway .
but the way these townies are colonizing the countryside is a little unpalatable .
it 's obvious what 's in for them - but what 's in it for brandenburg ?
i hope that sooner or later , it might at least start to reap some benefits from gentrification - even the g-word would be better than defunct train stations and empty school yards . author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.07.2010 italian autonomous car to drive from italy to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car will travel about 13,000 kilometers -lrb- 8,100 miles -rrb- between italy and china university of parma scientists have pioneered robotic cars that can navigate on their own .
they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .

but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.07.2010 seven european banks fail eu stress tests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european markets will rise or fall on the test results european banking regulators have released the results of their so-called stress tests .
many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "
airbus says the deals it has either sealed or set up at the british air show will eventually be worth almost 22 billion euros , and the company is considering further increases in production of its smaller , single-aisle a320 family to cope with rising demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' a380 is the new flagship , but not the cash cow " this was a good airshow for us and i think it was a good airshow for the aviation industry , " airbus chief executive thomas enders said on thursday , after the last major day for doing business at the farnborough show , which remains open to the public until sunday .
gains across the industry airbus 's strong sales were a welcome boon at farnborough , especially after the company 's us rival boeing flew in its new 787 dreamliner for its debut appearance outside the states .
the 787 is boeing 's answer to the airbus a380 superjumbo , and although it has a lower seating capacity and shorter range , many analysts predict its comparatively modest size could make it more saleable than airbus ' record-breaking passenger jet .
boeing has reported 103 new orders worth roughly eight billion euros at the trade fair , saying this performance points to a " continued recovery " for the industry .
aviation mogul steve udvar-hazy - a pioneer of the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s - also made a big-spending return in farnborough , ordering 100 airbus and boeing jets for his new business , air lease corp , triggering more orders from rival leasing companies .
airline shares have responded positively to the performance , although the apparent spike in sales is still being fuelled by emerging markets , with airlines in europe and north america relatively cautious .
sales at the biennial farnborough trade fair may not have approached the record levels of 2008 , when almost 70 billion euros changed hands , but they 're still a massive improvement on 2009 's post-financial crisis sister air show at le bourget , near paris , when sales totaled a meager 5.4 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

jane paulick wonders if the provinces got the short end of the stick . it 's been eye-meltingly hot in berlin for the last few weeks , and everyone who can is escaping the city whenever they have a free moment .
as luck would have it , receding ice age glaciers left literally hundreds of lakes scattered around the brandenburg countryside outside berlin , and this summer , i 've been struck by the growing number of people who 've acquired their own private waterside retreat . brandenburg , it seems , is to berlin what the hamptons are to new york - only it 's not , because a summer house on long island is a luxury financially far beyond the reach of mere mortals , whereas a dacha in the hinterlands of the german capital can still be had for a song . so while i 've been kidding myself that the city 's many outdoor swimming pools are actually quite nice places to be on my days off - despite the fact they 're overrun by teenage gangs and there are fries and fag-ends floating in the water - most long-time berlin residents simply would n't dream of spending a weekend in the city . feudal fantasies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise on berlin 's doorstep it 's not that surprising that so many of the ossis -lrb- east germans -rrb- i know own country abodes .
many of them inherited houses from their parents or grandparents , while others who grew up with brandenburg on their doorstep were snapping up bijou property bargains in its untamed , sunflower-filled lowlands long before these reached the radars of the hordes of west germans who only moved to berlin in the last decade . until recently , these denizens of hip neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg , mitte and kreuzberg would n't have set foot in the prussian provinces .
but it seems there 's been a shift in perceptions , and brandenburg is no longer considered such a final frontier . my suspicions were confirmed when , last week on the tram , i saw someone reading a book by swiss tv personality dieter moor about his attempts to run an organic farm near werneuchen , northeast of berlin - and later that day while flicking through the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , i noticed it was number three on its bestseller list . then there 's cabaret singer rainald grebe , currently satirizing urbanites ' sudden love affair with what used to be the badlands of brandenburg in his new show at the maxim gorki theater called " back to nature . " his conclusion is that it 's just another form of consumerism . " these fantasies of bucolic living are nothing more than complete greediness , " he said in a recent interview with berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine tip .
not that he 's blameless - he also dreams of the simple life . " it 's about having it all ; living in the city ; being networked and having your finger on the pulse - but also having a house in the country .
it 's not as though i actually want to weed , milk cows and grow tomatoes , " continued grebe , " it 's just some feudal fantasy of being a landowner lording it over the locals .
all i really want to do is sit in the sun , drink a latte macchiato and enjoy a view of a lake . " pastoral paradise sounds good to me .
never immune to the vagaries of fashion , i too have started dreaming of a lakeside getaway i might call my own . my first step has been to overcome some prejudices . admittedly , brandenburg does n't have the best of reputations . it 's associated first and foremost with neo-nazis , failed industry and a mass exodus of young people and doctors - and after several weekends spent driving around scouting for empty property , i can personally confirm there really are no doctors : one day when i realized i had an inflamed tick bite , i was sent by the friends i was visiting to get an antibiotics prescription from a veterinarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " was filmed on location in brandenburg as for the neo-nazis , i 'm assured by the same friends that the locals are salt of the earth and highly unlikely to vote far-right .
fair point .
state elections last september actually saw more than two thirds of the population vote either for the social democrats , the left party or the greens , and the region 's most famous daughter is none other than the ever-moderate chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in templin . other exemplary brandenburgers include 19th-century writer theodor fontane - who paid its rural charms loving tribute in his novels - and prussia 's most famous architect , karl friedrich schinkel , who left his mark in the form of countless palaces , villas and village churches . of yuppies and yokels if you 've seen michael hanecke 's oscar-nominated 2009 movie " the white ribbon , " then you know what a brandenburg village looks like : wide , cobblestone avenues that time seems to have forgotten , lined with chestnut trees and low farmhouses dating back at least 100 years . needless to say , it 's this historic , pre-communist architecture that appeals to berliners seeking scenic rustic tranquility , many of whom i 've encountered at the various public viewings of houses for sale that i 've attended in the last few months .
i 've even seen people i recognize from my local organic supermarket , although i 've never seen anyone who looks like they might be interested in buying something more permanent than a holiday home . few people want to live in brandenburg full-time .
one property valuation report i leafed through referred to the mass unemployment and inadequate infrastructure that characterize the region .
none of these factors matter much to the affluent berliners who can jump back in their suvs on sunday night after a relaxing few days in their converted barns . they ca n't be accused of pricing out locals , because locals are leaving in droves anyway .
but the way these townies are colonizing the countryside is a little unpalatable .
it 's obvious what 's in for them - but what 's in it for brandenburg ?
i hope that sooner or later , it might at least start to reap some benefits from gentrification - even the g-word would be better than defunct train stations and empty school yards . author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.07.2010 italian autonomous car to drive from italy to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car will travel about 13,000 kilometers -lrb- 8,100 miles -rrb- between italy and china university of parma scientists have pioneered robotic cars that can navigate on their own .
they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

doubts surface over eu bank stress tests on friday regulators release the results of " stress tests " carried out on banks to determine their health .
but markets are worried that the results wo n't mean much since the tests may not have been rigorous enough .
-lrb- 21.07.2010 -rrb- signs look good for banks , but not everyone thinks crisis is over auctions this week by the european central bank to inject liquidity into banks showed that financial institutions may be weaning themselves off emergency funds .
but some say any bank recovery underway is fragile .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .
there is nothing they could do more , says carl thayer , an expert on the southeast asian affairs at the australian defense force academy . " the asean regional forum can take no position that is compulsory on all members .
and asean individual states feel it -lrb- cheonan -rrb- is a bilateral issue and they usually abhor using force and threats that they see the us is applying . " delegates also discussed myanmar 's political process and human rights situation . according to janos martonyi , the hungarian foreign minister , myanmar is at a crossroads .
he called on the country to hold fair elections and release political prisoners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean foreign minister park ui chun myanmar and south china sea the us , on the other hand also raised concerns over myanmar 's alleged nuclear activities .
on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .
observers believe this , however , is unlikely . " in 2002 they negotiated a very weak declaration on the conduct of parties .
and that initial document was supposed to be the first step towards a code of conduct .
from 2002 to 2010 , it is eight years , we have n't proceeded .
so i do n't see a prospect of a binding code of conduct anytime soon , " says thayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south china sea islands are believed to be rich in resources influence of the us and china over the years china has become an important participant at the arf meetings .

thayer says the focus of us diplomacy is shifting .
under bush the us administration concentrated more on the global war on terror .
now the obama administration is showing a greater commitment to southeastern asia in response to the chinese challenge . " i think during the bush administration , china made great inroads using soft diplomacy and now the us is playing a multilateral game and that is music to asean ’ s ears , " says thayer .

the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "
airbus says the deals it has either sealed or set up at the british air show will eventually be worth almost 22 billion euros , and the company is considering further increases in production of its smaller , single-aisle a320 family to cope with rising demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' a380 is the new flagship , but not the cash cow " this was a good airshow for us and i think it was a good airshow for the aviation industry , " airbus chief executive thomas enders said on thursday , after the last major day for doing business at the farnborough show , which remains open to the public until sunday .
gains across the industry airbus 's strong sales were a welcome boon at farnborough , especially after the company 's us rival boeing flew in its new 787 dreamliner for its debut appearance outside the states .
the 787 is boeing 's answer to the airbus a380 superjumbo , and although it has a lower seating capacity and shorter range , many analysts predict its comparatively modest size could make it more saleable than airbus ' record-breaking passenger jet .
boeing has reported 103 new orders worth roughly eight billion euros at the trade fair , saying this performance points to a " continued recovery " for the industry .
aviation mogul steve udvar-hazy - a pioneer of the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s - also made a big-spending return in farnborough , ordering 100 airbus and boeing jets for his new business , air lease corp , triggering more orders from rival leasing companies .
airline shares have responded positively to the performance , although the apparent spike in sales is still being fuelled by emerging markets , with airlines in europe and north america relatively cautious .
sales at the biennial farnborough trade fair may not have approached the record levels of 2008 , when almost 70 billion euros changed hands , but they 're still a massive improvement on 2009 's post-financial crisis sister air show at le bourget , near paris , when sales totaled a meager 5.4 billion euros .

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 23.07.2010 german f1 star vettel needs a strong showing at hockenheim großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's not number one just now , but he really should be sebastian vettel is gunning for a home win this weekend at formula one 's german grand prix .
vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .

jane paulick wonders if the provinces got the short end of the stick . it 's been eye-meltingly hot in berlin for the last few weeks , and everyone who can is escaping the city whenever they have a free moment .
as luck would have it , receding ice age glaciers left literally hundreds of lakes scattered around the brandenburg countryside outside berlin , and this summer , i 've been struck by the growing number of people who 've acquired their own private waterside retreat . brandenburg , it seems , is to berlin what the hamptons are to new york - only it 's not , because a summer house on long island is a luxury financially far beyond the reach of mere mortals , whereas a dacha in the hinterlands of the german capital can still be had for a song . so while i 've been kidding myself that the city 's many outdoor swimming pools are actually quite nice places to be on my days off - despite the fact they 're overrun by teenage gangs and there are fries and fag-ends floating in the water - most long-time berlin residents simply would n't dream of spending a weekend in the city . feudal fantasies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise on berlin 's doorstep it 's not that surprising that so many of the ossis -lrb- east germans -rrb- i know own country abodes .
many of them inherited houses from their parents or grandparents , while others who grew up with brandenburg on their doorstep were snapping up bijou property bargains in its untamed , sunflower-filled lowlands long before these reached the radars of the hordes of west germans who only moved to berlin in the last decade . until recently , these denizens of hip neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg , mitte and kreuzberg would n't have set foot in the prussian provinces .
but it seems there 's been a shift in perceptions , and brandenburg is no longer considered such a final frontier . my suspicions were confirmed when , last week on the tram , i saw someone reading a book by swiss tv personality dieter moor about his attempts to run an organic farm near werneuchen , northeast of berlin - and later that day while flicking through the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , i noticed it was number three on its bestseller list . then there 's cabaret singer rainald grebe , currently satirizing urbanites ' sudden love affair with what used to be the badlands of brandenburg in his new show at the maxim gorki theater called " back to nature . " his conclusion is that it 's just another form of consumerism . " these fantasies of bucolic living are nothing more than complete greediness , " he said in a recent interview with berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine tip .
not that he 's blameless - he also dreams of the simple life . " it 's about having it all ; living in the city ; being networked and having your finger on the pulse - but also having a house in the country .
it 's not as though i actually want to weed , milk cows and grow tomatoes , " continued grebe , " it 's just some feudal fantasy of being a landowner lording it over the locals .
all i really want to do is sit in the sun , drink a latte macchiato and enjoy a view of a lake . " pastoral paradise sounds good to me .
never immune to the vagaries of fashion , i too have started dreaming of a lakeside getaway i might call my own . my first step has been to overcome some prejudices . admittedly , brandenburg does n't have the best of reputations . it 's associated first and foremost with neo-nazis , failed industry and a mass exodus of young people and doctors - and after several weekends spent driving around scouting for empty property , i can personally confirm there really are no doctors : one day when i realized i had an inflamed tick bite , i was sent by the friends i was visiting to get an antibiotics prescription from a veterinarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " was filmed on location in brandenburg as for the neo-nazis , i 'm assured by the same friends that the locals are salt of the earth and highly unlikely to vote far-right .
fair point .
state elections last september actually saw more than two thirds of the population vote either for the social democrats , the left party or the greens , and the region 's most famous daughter is none other than the ever-moderate chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in templin . other exemplary brandenburgers include 19th-century writer theodor fontane - who paid its rural charms loving tribute in his novels - and prussia 's most famous architect , karl friedrich schinkel , who left his mark in the form of countless palaces , villas and village churches . of yuppies and yokels if you 've seen michael hanecke 's oscar-nominated 2009 movie " the white ribbon , " then you know what a brandenburg village looks like : wide , cobblestone avenues that time seems to have forgotten , lined with chestnut trees and low farmhouses dating back at least 100 years . needless to say , it 's this historic , pre-communist architecture that appeals to berliners seeking scenic rustic tranquility , many of whom i 've encountered at the various public viewings of houses for sale that i 've attended in the last few months .
i 've even seen people i recognize from my local organic supermarket , although i 've never seen anyone who looks like they might be interested in buying something more permanent than a holiday home . few people want to live in brandenburg full-time .
one property valuation report i leafed through referred to the mass unemployment and inadequate infrastructure that characterize the region .
none of these factors matter much to the affluent berliners who can jump back in their suvs on sunday night after a relaxing few days in their converted barns . they ca n't be accused of pricing out locals , because locals are leaving in droves anyway .
but the way these townies are colonizing the countryside is a little unpalatable .
it 's obvious what 's in for them - but what 's in it for brandenburg ?
i hope that sooner or later , it might at least start to reap some benefits from gentrification - even the g-word would be better than defunct train stations and empty school yards . author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

state elections last september actually saw more than two thirds of the population vote either for the social democrats , the left party or the greens , and the region 's most famous daughter is none other than the ever-moderate chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in templin . other exemplary brandenburgers include 19th-century writer theodor fontane - who paid its rural charms loving tribute in his novels - and prussia 's most famous architect , karl friedrich schinkel , who left his mark in the form of countless palaces , villas and village churches . of yuppies and yokels if you 've seen michael hanecke 's oscar-nominated 2009 movie " the white ribbon , " then you know what a brandenburg village looks like : wide , cobblestone avenues that time seems to have forgotten , lined with chestnut trees and low farmhouses dating back at least 100 years . needless to say , it 's this historic , pre-communist architecture that appeals to berliners seeking scenic rustic tranquility , many of whom i 've encountered at the various public viewings of houses for sale that i 've attended in the last few months .
i 've even seen people i recognize from my local organic supermarket , although i 've never seen anyone who looks like they might be interested in buying something more permanent than a holiday home . few people want to live in brandenburg full-time .
one property valuation report i leafed through referred to the mass unemployment and inadequate infrastructure that characterize the region .
none of these factors matter much to the affluent berliners who can jump back in their suvs on sunday night after a relaxing few days in their converted barns . they ca n't be accused of pricing out locals , because locals are leaving in droves anyway .
but the way these townies are colonizing the countryside is a little unpalatable .
it 's obvious what 's in for them - but what 's in it for brandenburg ?
i hope that sooner or later , it might at least start to reap some benefits from gentrification - even the g-word would be better than defunct train stations and empty school yards . author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the call comes as the oil spill in the gulf of mexico near its 15th week . with the bp oil spill fiasco in the gulf of mexico entering its fourth month , germany 's environment minister , norbert roettgen , has called for a moratorium on new oil drilling in the north sea .
roettgen said the measure should be taken until an investigation can determine exactly what went wrong in the oil rig explosion that led to the spill off the united states coast , which has become the country 's worst-ever environmental disaster .
" we take risks , but we ca n't take every risk , " roettgen told public broadcaster zdf .
" without safety there can be no drilling . "
roettgen said , however , he doubted that other north sea countries would go along with a moratorium .
he added that environmental and safety standards applied to north sea drilling operations differed from those used in the united states .
countries straddling the north sea include norway , denmark , the netherlands , belgium , france , britain and germany .
the calls by the german environment minister come two weeks after european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger called for a halt on deep sea drilling - a demand that was rebuffed by a number of eu states , including the uk .
individual eu member states are responsible for approving or rejecting drilling proposals in their own waters .

while the us senate is investigating , experts are n't surprised . the senators were incensed .
in an open letter to the us secretary of state on july 13 , four democratic lawmakers urged hillary clinton to fully investigate reports about a possible link between bp and the release of the convicted lockerbie bomber by the british government .
" the question we now have to answer is , was this corporation willing to trade justice in the murder of 270 innocent people for oil profits ? " the senators ask in their letter .
on july 29 , the senate foreign relations committee will convene a hearing on the issue . at the heart of the case is abdelbaset al-megrahi , a libyan national who was convicted of blowing up pan am flight 103 in 1988 over the scottish village of lockerbie .
270 people , including 189 americans , were killed in the downing of the airliner .
al-megrahi was released in august last year on compassionate grounds because he was diagnosed with a terminal illness .
his release and the subsequent hero 's welcome he received in libya caused a public outcry in the us .
bp lobbied for a prisoner deal , not for al-megrahi two days after the senators ' letter was published , bp admitted that it had in fact lobbied the british government in 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with libya because it was concerned a slow resolution would impact an offshore drilling deal with libya .
the prisoner deal was ultimately agreed upon by the british government in 2007 , the same year bp reached an exploration deal worth 900 million dollars with libya .
while bp admitted lobbying for the prisoner deal , it said it was not involved in discussions about the freeing of al-megrahi .
" the decision to release al-megrahi in august 2009 was taken by the scottish government , " bp said in a statement on july 15 " it is not for bp to comment on the decision of the scottish government .
bp was not involved in any such discussions about the release of al-megrahi . "
according to the oil company 's statement , " bp told the uk government that we were concerned about the slow progress that was being made in concluding a prisoner transfer agreement with libya . "
" we were aware that this could have a negative impact on uk commercial interests , including the ratification by the libyan government of bp 's exploration agreement , " the statement read .
lobbying power house asked whether he was surprised about bp 's admitted lobbying for a controversial prisoner release deal with libya , thomas seifert , who wrote an acclaimed book on the oil industry and works as foreign affairs editor at the austrian daily " die presse " , is unequivocal : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelbaset al-megrahi was welcomed in tripoli by the libyan leader 's son , seif al-islam gadhafi " no , not at all , " he said .
" it 's about a 900 million dollar deal in libya and that 's why bp lobbied .
and that 's not a crime , and of course they can do that .
we all can lobby our governments for better schools and universities or things like that .
but of course it helps quite a bit if you have the firepower of multi-billion dollar companies to pay lobbyists who have gone the revolving door in and out of governments and have a pretty good network in the governments . "
dave levinthal , communications director with the center for responsive politics in washington , which runs the lobbying clearinghouse opensecrets.org , put the current case of bp 's lobbying for a prisoner deal in a larger context : " certainly what we see in the united states is that bp , particularly in recent years , has really spent a considerable amount of money on lobbying efforts and lobbying federal level politicians in the united states .
so it does serve to reason that they would be doing similar things , be it in britain or otherwise in europe when it comes to political lobbying . "
according to levinthal , bp spent more than 15 million dollars last year alone for lobbying the us federal government .
that ranks the company fourth among all oil and gas related corporations in terms of lobbying expenditure .
only exxonmobil , chevron , conocophilips spent more money lobbying the us government than bp .
" it 's important to note that they have a small army of lobbyists , " said levinthal .
they have literally dozens of people who lobby on their behalf and when you consider just that mere fact , they have a lot of resources to draw from . "
friends lobbying friends but perhaps even more important than the sheer amount of money poured into lobbying is the cadre of people bp hires to do the job .
" when you go a little bit deeper you notice that many of the people bp has hired as lobbyists are actually former government officials , " said levinthal .
" they are in some cases former federal level staffers , they are former congressional staffers , in some cases they are even former members of congress . "
bildunterschrift : last month , bp ceo tony hayward had to testify on capitol hill about the oil spill in the gulf of mexico for companies like bp it makes perfect sense to hire people who know the political system .
" these are people who have worked in the government , these are people who have friends in the government " , said levinthal .
" and just like if you wanted to try to convince your friend to do something , you probably have a much better chance of convincing your friend to do what you want than a perfect stranger . "
details of lobbying usually do n't become public apparently that is also how bp lobbied the british government over the prisoner transfer deal .
according to the " wall street journal , " bp told the paper that a special adviser to bp who had previously worked for the british intelligence service mi6 had raised the prisoner transfer agreement , but not the specific case of al mehgrahi , with then-justice secretary jack straw .
although it is easy to single out bp for criticism for their lobbying practices , that 's not really fair , notes thomas seifert : " if you have a certain size of an industry or of a company then basically the interest of this company might coincide with the interest of this country .
we are talking about thousands of jobs ; we are talking about providing the energy infrastructure , providing the lifeblood of our whole industrial system , so it 's pretty significant . "
what 's more , adds seifert , most other international energy companies are also engaged in lobbying all over the world to get access to oil and gas reserves .
however , what is unusual about the bp case is not necessarily the lobbying efforts themselves , but the fact that this kind of detailed information has become public .
perhaps the senators will unearth even more aspects of bp 's efforts to influence the british government in their hearing on the case .

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.07.2010 italian autonomous car to drive from italy to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car will travel about 13,000 kilometers -lrb- 8,100 miles -rrb- between italy and china university of parma scientists have pioneered robotic cars that can navigate on their own .
they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .
but i think this will be the very last application . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

this year it seems especially bad .
the affected area is almost the size of germany and even visible from outer space .
it appears like a gigantic foul-smelling carpet , 377 000 square kilometers in size , spreading from finland to the german-polish border and to the island of ruegen .
it is the biggest algae explosion since 2005 .
a combination of farming and weather bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wwf says current conditions are ' perfect ' for algae growth it 's not just the sunny weather which is driving the bloom .
it 's also the large quantity of phosphorus in the water .
" over-fertilization is the biggest environmental problem facing the baltic , " said jochen lamp from the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in hamburg .
the phosphates are being washed off farmland and from rivers into the baltic sea .
wwf has criticized countries bordering on the baltic for their disjointed response to the problem .
on the one hand they seem eager to reduce over-fertilization , on the other they encourage farmers to use more fertilizers .
sweden for example has abolished its tax on fertilizers and in the north-eastern part of germany , in mecklenburg-western pomerania , farmers are now allowed to manure their land within a meter of dikes and creeks - it used to be seven meters .
algae cause death zones in the water algae blooms can be disastrous for ecoystems , causing dead zones under water .
they suck up the oxygen , leaving none for plants and animals .
" this is especially bad for fish , crawfish , starfish and crabs living in the ground .
their lives are severely affected and in the worst case they die , " says wera leujak , specialist for oceanic security at the german federal environment agency .
the baltic sea already has quite a number of these dead zones , but the algae exacerbate them .
for humans , the blue-green algae are unhealthy as well .
they can cause skin rashes , allergic reactions or diarrhoea and damage the liver .
bildunterschrift : the blue-green algae bloom can even be seen from space clear water , clear samples yet despite a media uproar in europe this week , the situation is not that much worse than normal .
on thursday , a research ship took water samples from the baltic sea on the west coast of ruegen .
" at least for this area , we can give the all-clear , " said harald stegemann , head of the state environmental office for mecklenburg-western pomerania in guestrow , who initiated the operation .
" the samples looked like tap water and the colleagues on board did n't see any algae carpets , although we expected it to be different . "
on other parts of the baltic sea algae are visible .
" there are these tiny little algae floating around and colouring the water green and yellowish , " said thomas merck .
he works on the small island of vilm near ruegen and has lived there for a couple of years now .
" speaking from experience , all i can say is : it just happens regularly . "
algae comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , beaches have stayed open - with a bit of rain the algae may even disappear .
for this reason , local scientists are reluctant to join the hysteria .
of course the area looks huge on satellite images .
" but the important question is : is it just a film of two or three millimeters or is it a real carpet of two or three centimeters ? "
stegemann explains .
for him , it does not seem to be very dramatic , though he concedes that sufficient data has not yet been gathered to dismiss the problem out of hand .
in any event , the carpet may well disappear during the next few days anyway : " if it cools down , if it gets stormy , if it rains , the water will intermingle and it 's all over , " stegemann said .

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .
there is nothing they could do more , says carl thayer , an expert on the southeast asian affairs at the australian defense force academy . " the asean regional forum can take no position that is compulsory on all members .
and asean individual states feel it -lrb- cheonan -rrb- is a bilateral issue and they usually abhor using force and threats that they see the us is applying .

on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .
observers believe this , however , is unlikely . " in 2002 they negotiated a very weak declaration on the conduct of parties .
and that initial document was supposed to be the first step towards a code of conduct .
from 2002 to 2010 , it is eight years , we have n't proceeded .
so i do n't see a prospect of a binding code of conduct anytime soon , " says thayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south china sea islands are believed to be rich in resources influence of the us and china over the years china has become an important participant at the arf meetings .

thayer says the focus of us diplomacy is shifting .
under bush the us administration concentrated more on the global war on terror .
now the obama administration is showing a greater commitment to southeastern asia in response to the chinese challenge . " i think during the bush administration , china made great inroads using soft diplomacy and now the us is playing a multilateral game and that is music to asean ’ s ears , " says thayer .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .

on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

doubts surface over eu bank stress tests on friday regulators release the results of " stress tests " carried out on banks to determine their health .

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "
airbus says the deals it has either sealed or set up at the british air show will eventually be worth almost 22 billion euros , and the company is considering further increases in production of its smaller , single-aisle a320 family to cope with rising demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' a380 is the new flagship , but not the cash cow " this was a good airshow for us and i think it was a good airshow for the aviation industry , " airbus chief executive thomas enders said on thursday , after the last major day for doing business at the farnborough show , which remains open to the public until sunday .
gains across the industry airbus 's strong sales were a welcome boon at farnborough , especially after the company 's us rival boeing flew in its new 787 dreamliner for its debut appearance outside the states .
the 787 is boeing 's answer to the airbus a380 superjumbo , and although it has a lower seating capacity and shorter range , many analysts predict its comparatively modest size could make it more saleable than airbus ' record-breaking passenger jet .
boeing has reported 103 new orders worth roughly eight billion euros at the trade fair , saying this performance points to a " continued recovery " for the industry .
aviation mogul steve udvar-hazy - a pioneer of the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s - also made a big-spending return in farnborough , ordering 100 airbus and boeing jets for his new business , air lease corp , triggering more orders from rival leasing companies .
airline shares have responded positively to the performance , although the apparent spike in sales is still being fuelled by emerging markets , with airlines in europe and north america relatively cautious .
sales at the biennial farnborough trade fair may not have approached the record levels of 2008 , when almost 70 billion euros changed hands , but they 're still a massive improvement on 2009 's post-financial crisis sister air show at le bourget , near paris , when sales totaled a meager 5.4 billion euros .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 23.07.2010 us senate to probe possible links between bp and the release of the lockerbie bomber großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers want to know whether bp played a role in the release of the lockerbie bomber already under fire for the oil spill , bp has admitted lobbying the uk government over a controversial prisoner release deal with libya .
while the us senate is investigating , experts are n't surprised . the senators were incensed .
in an open letter to the us secretary of state on july 13 , four democratic lawmakers urged hillary clinton to fully investigate reports about a possible link between bp and the release of the convicted lockerbie bomber by the british government .
" the question we now have to answer is , was this corporation willing to trade justice in the murder of 270 innocent people for oil profits ? " the senators ask in their letter .
on july 29 , the senate foreign relations committee will convene a hearing on the issue . at the heart of the case is abdelbaset al-megrahi , a libyan national who was convicted of blowing up pan am flight 103 in 1988 over the scottish village of lockerbie .
270 people , including 189 americans , were killed in the downing of the airliner .
al-megrahi was released in august last year on compassionate grounds because he was diagnosed with a terminal illness .
his release and the subsequent hero 's welcome he received in libya caused a public outcry in the us .
bp lobbied for a prisoner deal , not for al-megrahi two days after the senators ' letter was published , bp admitted that it had in fact lobbied the british government in 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with libya because it was concerned a slow resolution would impact an offshore drilling deal with libya .
the prisoner deal was ultimately agreed upon by the british government in 2007 , the same year bp reached an exploration deal worth 900 million dollars with libya .
while bp admitted lobbying for the prisoner deal , it said it was not involved in discussions about the freeing of al-megrahi .
" the decision to release al-megrahi in august 2009 was taken by the scottish government , " bp said in a statement on july 15 " it is not for bp to comment on the decision of the scottish government .
bp was not involved in any such discussions about the release of al-megrahi . "
according to the oil company 's statement , " bp told the uk government that we were concerned about the slow progress that was being made in concluding a prisoner transfer agreement with libya . "
" we were aware that this could have a negative impact on uk commercial interests , including the ratification by the libyan government of bp 's exploration agreement , " the statement read .
lobbying power house asked whether he was surprised about bp 's admitted lobbying for a controversial prisoner release deal with libya , thomas seifert , who wrote an acclaimed book on the oil industry and works as foreign affairs editor at the austrian daily " die presse " , is unequivocal : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelbaset al-megrahi was welcomed in tripoli by the libyan leader 's son , seif al-islam gadhafi " no , not at all , " he said .
" it 's about a 900 million dollar deal in libya and that 's why bp lobbied .
and that 's not a crime , and of course they can do that .
we all can lobby our governments for better schools and universities or things like that .
but of course it helps quite a bit if you have the firepower of multi-billion dollar companies to pay lobbyists who have gone the revolving door in and out of governments and have a pretty good network in the governments . "
dave levinthal , communications director with the center for responsive politics in washington , which runs the lobbying clearinghouse opensecrets.org , put the current case of bp 's lobbying for a prisoner deal in a larger context : " certainly what we see in the united states is that bp , particularly in recent years , has really spent a considerable amount of money on lobbying efforts and lobbying federal level politicians in the united states .
so it does serve to reason that they would be doing similar things , be it in britain or otherwise in europe when it comes to political lobbying . "
according to levinthal , bp spent more than 15 million dollars last year alone for lobbying the us federal government .
that ranks the company fourth among all oil and gas related corporations in terms of lobbying expenditure .
only exxonmobil , chevron , conocophilips spent more money lobbying the us government than bp .
" it 's important to note that they have a small army of lobbyists , " said levinthal .
they have literally dozens of people who lobby on their behalf and when you consider just that mere fact , they have a lot of resources to draw from . "
friends lobbying friends but perhaps even more important than the sheer amount of money poured into lobbying is the cadre of people bp hires to do the job .
" when you go a little bit deeper you notice that many of the people bp has hired as lobbyists are actually former government officials , " said levinthal .
" they are in some cases former federal level staffers , they are former congressional staffers , in some cases they are even former members of congress . "
bildunterschrift : last month , bp ceo tony hayward had to testify on capitol hill about the oil spill in the gulf of mexico for companies like bp it makes perfect sense to hire people who know the political system .
" these are people who have worked in the government , these are people who have friends in the government " , said levinthal .
" and just like if you wanted to try to convince your friend to do something , you probably have a much better chance of convincing your friend to do what you want than a perfect stranger . "
details of lobbying usually do n't become public apparently that is also how bp lobbied the british government over the prisoner transfer deal .
according to the " wall street journal , " bp told the paper that a special adviser to bp who had previously worked for the british intelligence service mi6 had raised the prisoner transfer agreement , but not the specific case of al mehgrahi , with then-justice secretary jack straw .
although it is easy to single out bp for criticism for their lobbying practices , that 's not really fair , notes thomas seifert : " if you have a certain size of an industry or of a company then basically the interest of this company might coincide with the interest of this country .
we are talking about thousands of jobs ; we are talking about providing the energy infrastructure , providing the lifeblood of our whole industrial system , so it 's pretty significant . "
what 's more , adds seifert , most other international energy companies are also engaged in lobbying all over the world to get access to oil and gas reserves .
however , what is unusual about the bp case is not necessarily the lobbying efforts themselves , but the fact that this kind of detailed information has become public .
perhaps the senators will unearth even more aspects of bp 's efforts to influence the british government in their hearing on the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 23.07.2010 oil company fined over ivory coast toxic dump großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura concealed the harmful nature of the waste , the court found a dutch court has fined oil firm trafigura one million euros for violating european laws on the export of waste , four years after the company dumped toxic waste meant to remain in amsterdam in ivory coast . swiss-based oil company trafigura was fined one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- on friday by an amsterdam court for violating eu laws on the export of hazardous waste , which the un says killed at least 15 people and forced thousands to be hospitalized in 2006 .
the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

as luck would have it , receding ice age glaciers left literally hundreds of lakes scattered around the brandenburg countryside outside berlin , and this summer , i 've been struck by the growing number of people who 've acquired their own private waterside retreat . brandenburg , it seems , is to berlin what the hamptons are to new york - only it 's not , because a summer house on long island is a luxury financially far beyond the reach of mere mortals , whereas a dacha in the hinterlands of the german capital can still be had for a song . so while i 've been kidding myself that the city 's many outdoor swimming pools are actually quite nice places to be on my days off - despite the fact they 're overrun by teenage gangs and there are fries and fag-ends floating in the water - most long-time berlin residents simply would n't dream of spending a weekend in the city . feudal fantasies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paradise on berlin 's doorstep it 's not that surprising that so many of the ossis -lrb- east germans -rrb- i know own country abodes .
many of them inherited houses from their parents or grandparents , while others who grew up with brandenburg on their doorstep were snapping up bijou property bargains in its untamed , sunflower-filled lowlands long before these reached the radars of the hordes of west germans who only moved to berlin in the last decade . until recently , these denizens of hip neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg , mitte and kreuzberg would n't have set foot in the prussian provinces .
but it seems there 's been a shift in perceptions , and brandenburg is no longer considered such a final frontier . my suspicions were confirmed when , last week on the tram , i saw someone reading a book by swiss tv personality dieter moor about his attempts to run an organic farm near werneuchen , northeast of berlin - and later that day while flicking through the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel , i noticed it was number three on its bestseller list . then there 's cabaret singer rainald grebe , currently satirizing urbanites ' sudden love affair with what used to be the badlands of brandenburg in his new show at the maxim gorki theater called " back to nature . " his conclusion is that it 's just another form of consumerism . " these fantasies of bucolic living are nothing more than complete greediness , " he said in a recent interview with berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine tip .
not that he 's blameless - he also dreams of the simple life . " it 's about having it all ; living in the city ; being networked and having your finger on the pulse - but also having a house in the country .
it 's not as though i actually want to weed , milk cows and grow tomatoes , " continued grebe , " it 's just some feudal fantasy of being a landowner lording it over the locals .
all i really want to do is sit in the sun , drink a latte macchiato and enjoy a view of a lake . " pastoral paradise sounds good to me .
never immune to the vagaries of fashion , i too have started dreaming of a lakeside getaway i might call my own . my first step has been to overcome some prejudices . admittedly , brandenburg does n't have the best of reputations . it 's associated first and foremost with neo-nazis , failed industry and a mass exodus of young people and doctors - and after several weekends spent driving around scouting for empty property , i can personally confirm there really are no doctors : one day when i realized i had an inflamed tick bite , i was sent by the friends i was visiting to get an antibiotics prescription from a veterinarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " was filmed on location in brandenburg as for the neo-nazis , i 'm assured by the same friends that the locals are salt of the earth and highly unlikely to vote far-right .
fair point .
state elections last september actually saw more than two thirds of the population vote either for the social democrats , the left party or the greens , and the region 's most famous daughter is none other than the ever-moderate chancellor angela merkel , who grew up in templin . other exemplary brandenburgers include 19th-century writer theodor fontane - who paid its rural charms loving tribute in his novels - and prussia 's most famous architect , karl friedrich schinkel , who left his mark in the form of countless palaces , villas and village churches . of yuppies and yokels if you 've seen michael hanecke 's oscar-nominated 2009 movie " the white ribbon , " then you know what a brandenburg village looks like : wide , cobblestone avenues that time seems to have forgotten , lined with chestnut trees and low farmhouses dating back at least 100 years . needless to say , it 's this historic , pre-communist architecture that appeals to berliners seeking scenic rustic tranquility , many of whom i 've encountered at the various public viewings of houses for sale that i 've attended in the last few months .
i 've even seen people i recognize from my local organic supermarket , although i 've never seen anyone who looks like they might be interested in buying something more permanent than a holiday home . few people want to live in brandenburg full-time .
one property valuation report i leafed through referred to the mass unemployment and inadequate infrastructure that characterize the region .
none of these factors matter much to the affluent berliners who can jump back in their suvs on sunday night after a relaxing few days in their converted barns . they ca n't be accused of pricing out locals , because locals are leaving in droves anyway .
but the way these townies are colonizing the countryside is a little unpalatable .
it 's obvious what 's in for them - but what 's in it for brandenburg ?
i hope that sooner or later , it might at least start to reap some benefits from gentrification - even the g-word would be better than defunct train stations and empty school yards . author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

while the us senate is investigating , experts are n't surprised . the senators were incensed .
in an open letter to the us secretary of state on july 13 , four democratic lawmakers urged hillary clinton to fully investigate reports about a possible link between bp and the release of the convicted lockerbie bomber by the british government .
" the question we now have to answer is , was this corporation willing to trade justice in the murder of 270 innocent people for oil profits ? " the senators ask in their letter .
on july 29 , the senate foreign relations committee will convene a hearing on the issue . at the heart of the case is abdelbaset al-megrahi , a libyan national who was convicted of blowing up pan am flight 103 in 1988 over the scottish village of lockerbie .
270 people , including 189 americans , were killed in the downing of the airliner .
al-megrahi was released in august last year on compassionate grounds because he was diagnosed with a terminal illness .
his release and the subsequent hero 's welcome he received in libya caused a public outcry in the us .
bp lobbied for a prisoner deal , not for al-megrahi two days after the senators ' letter was published , bp admitted that it had in fact lobbied the british government in 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with libya because it was concerned a slow resolution would impact an offshore drilling deal with libya .
the prisoner deal was ultimately agreed upon by the british government in 2007 , the same year bp reached an exploration deal worth 900 million dollars with libya .
while bp admitted lobbying for the prisoner deal , it said it was not involved in discussions about the freeing of al-megrahi .
" the decision to release al-megrahi in august 2009 was taken by the scottish government , " bp said in a statement on july 15 " it is not for bp to comment on the decision of the scottish government .
bp was not involved in any such discussions about the release of al-megrahi . "
according to the oil company 's statement , " bp told the uk government that we were concerned about the slow progress that was being made in concluding a prisoner transfer agreement with libya . "
" we were aware that this could have a negative impact on uk commercial interests , including the ratification by the libyan government of bp 's exploration agreement , " the statement read .
lobbying power house asked whether he was surprised about bp 's admitted lobbying for a controversial prisoner release deal with libya , thomas seifert , who wrote an acclaimed book on the oil industry and works as foreign affairs editor at the austrian daily " die presse " , is unequivocal : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelbaset al-megrahi was welcomed in tripoli by the libyan leader 's son , seif al-islam gadhafi " no , not at all , " he said .
" it 's about a 900 million dollar deal in libya and that 's why bp lobbied .
and that 's not a crime , and of course they can do that .
we all can lobby our governments for better schools and universities or things like that .
but of course it helps quite a bit if you have the firepower of multi-billion dollar companies to pay lobbyists who have gone the revolving door in and out of governments and have a pretty good network in the governments . "
dave levinthal , communications director with the center for responsive politics in washington , which runs the lobbying clearinghouse opensecrets.org , put the current case of bp 's lobbying for a prisoner deal in a larger context : " certainly what we see in the united states is that bp , particularly in recent years , has really spent a considerable amount of money on lobbying efforts and lobbying federal level politicians in the united states .
so it does serve to reason that they would be doing similar things , be it in britain or otherwise in europe when it comes to political lobbying . "
according to levinthal , bp spent more than 15 million dollars last year alone for lobbying the us federal government .
that ranks the company fourth among all oil and gas related corporations in terms of lobbying expenditure .
only exxonmobil , chevron , conocophilips spent more money lobbying the us government than bp .
" it 's important to note that they have a small army of lobbyists , " said levinthal .
they have literally dozens of people who lobby on their behalf and when you consider just that mere fact , they have a lot of resources to draw from . "
friends lobbying friends but perhaps even more important than the sheer amount of money poured into lobbying is the cadre of people bp hires to do the job .
" when you go a little bit deeper you notice that many of the people bp has hired as lobbyists are actually former government officials , " said levinthal .
" they are in some cases former federal level staffers , they are former congressional staffers , in some cases they are even former members of congress . "
bildunterschrift : last month , bp ceo tony hayward had to testify on capitol hill about the oil spill in the gulf of mexico for companies like bp it makes perfect sense to hire people who know the political system .
" these are people who have worked in the government , these are people who have friends in the government " , said levinthal .
" and just like if you wanted to try to convince your friend to do something , you probably have a much better chance of convincing your friend to do what you want than a perfect stranger . "
details of lobbying usually do n't become public apparently that is also how bp lobbied the british government over the prisoner transfer deal .
according to the " wall street journal , " bp told the paper that a special adviser to bp who had previously worked for the british intelligence service mi6 had raised the prisoner transfer agreement , but not the specific case of al mehgrahi , with then-justice secretary jack straw .
although it is easy to single out bp for criticism for their lobbying practices , that 's not really fair , notes thomas seifert : " if you have a certain size of an industry or of a company then basically the interest of this company might coincide with the interest of this country .
we are talking about thousands of jobs ; we are talking about providing the energy infrastructure , providing the lifeblood of our whole industrial system , so it 's pretty significant . "
what 's more , adds seifert , most other international energy companies are also engaged in lobbying all over the world to get access to oil and gas reserves .
however , what is unusual about the bp case is not necessarily the lobbying efforts themselves , but the fact that this kind of detailed information has become public .
perhaps the senators will unearth even more aspects of bp 's efforts to influence the british government in their hearing on the case .

the ifo index showed the largest gain in business confidence in 20 years . german business confidence surged unexpectedly in july to record its highest monthly gain since the country 's reunification 20 years ago , a key business climate survey published friday showed .
the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "
airbus says the deals it has either sealed or set up at the british air show will eventually be worth almost 22 billion euros , and the company is considering further increases in production of its smaller , single-aisle a320 family to cope with rising demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' a380 is the new flagship , but not the cash cow " this was a good airshow for us and i think it was a good airshow for the aviation industry , " airbus chief executive thomas enders said on thursday , after the last major day for doing business at the farnborough show , which remains open to the public until sunday .
gains across the industry airbus 's strong sales were a welcome boon at farnborough , especially after the company 's us rival boeing flew in its new 787 dreamliner for its debut appearance outside the states .
the 787 is boeing 's answer to the airbus a380 superjumbo , and although it has a lower seating capacity and shorter range , many analysts predict its comparatively modest size could make it more saleable than airbus ' record-breaking passenger jet .
boeing has reported 103 new orders worth roughly eight billion euros at the trade fair , saying this performance points to a " continued recovery " for the industry .
aviation mogul steve udvar-hazy - a pioneer of the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s - also made a big-spending return in farnborough , ordering 100 airbus and boeing jets for his new business , air lease corp , triggering more orders from rival leasing companies .
airline shares have responded positively to the performance , although the apparent spike in sales is still being fuelled by emerging markets , with airlines in europe and north america relatively cautious .
sales at the biennial farnborough trade fair may not have approached the record levels of 2008 , when almost 70 billion euros changed hands , but they 're still a massive improvement on 2009 's post-financial crisis sister air show at le bourget , near paris , when sales totaled a meager 5.4 billion euros .

" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "

of late she has been complaining of breathlessness .
she knows it could be the result of asbestos-related ailments and if untreated could possibly lead to lung cancer and skin diseases .
but shashwati says she has no option but to continue living in her house made of this dangerous material .
" for years now i have been living under a roof made of asbestos .
and so are the doors .
of late when i close the door , i feel a problem in my breathing .
but what shall i do ?
we are poor , and where can we go ?
i know of the bad effects of asbestos especially when particles fall . "
rise in asbestos use the indian asbestos industry generates more than $ 850 million a year in revenue , and directly employs 300,000 people ; indirectly , it supports as many as 3 million more .
backed by a powerful lobby , asbestos use in india has risen by 83 percent since 2004 , according to government figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at an asbestos mine in udaipur , india given evidence of poor workplace safety and weak regulations , such widespread use could prove disastrous , say health experts .
asbestos products carry no health warning labels and trade unions have no mandate to prevent asbestos-related disease at workplaces .
indian consumers are also unlikely to know that as asbestos-cement erodes and crumbles , dangerous fibers are released .
" even if a single fiber is inhaled , it is capable of causing mesothelioma , and that has been proven by epidemiological as well clinical and experimental studies , " says dr sanjay chaturvedi , a professor of community medicine .
" we have to preclude all possible release of asbestos in the environment wherever there is a possibility of human exposure . "
hazardous effects research has shown that worldwide , at least 90,000 people die every year from illnesses resulting from occupational exposure to asbestos .
however , this number only takes into account workers and ex-workers who have been identified with asbestos-related lung cancer , mesothelioma , and asbestosis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an asbestos mine worker in andhra pradesh , india gopal krishna , who heads the ban asbestos network of india , says as the market is growing at a tremendous pace , nobody in india has time to deal with complaints .
" there is an incestuous relationship between the asbestos manufacturing industry in india , the government and the political parties .
that incestuous relationship has led to it being supported .
in india we have some 300 medical colleges .
none of them has the competence to diagnose the diseases caused by asbestos .
so lack of documentation does not mean a lack of a problem in india .
the rate of consumption of asbestos is rising at an alarming rate , so are the diseases caused by asbestos . "
but as the indian states and union territories have no mechanism to prove that lung cancer deaths and other skin diseases are being caused by asbestos exposures , the indian asbestos industry could not care less about global efforts to ban the material everywhere including india . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year it seems especially bad .
the affected area is almost the size of germany and even visible from outer space .
it appears like a gigantic foul-smelling carpet , 377 000 square kilometers in size , spreading from finland to the german-polish border and to the island of ruegen .
it is the biggest algae explosion since 2005 .
a combination of farming and weather bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wwf says current conditions are ' perfect ' for algae growth it 's not just the sunny weather which is driving the bloom .
it 's also the large quantity of phosphorus in the water .
" over-fertilization is the biggest environmental problem facing the baltic , " said jochen lamp from the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in hamburg .
the phosphates are being washed off farmland and from rivers into the baltic sea .
wwf has criticized countries bordering on the baltic for their disjointed response to the problem .
on the one hand they seem eager to reduce over-fertilization , on the other they encourage farmers to use more fertilizers .
sweden for example has abolished its tax on fertilizers and in the north-eastern part of germany , in mecklenburg-western pomerania , farmers are now allowed to manure their land within a meter of dikes and creeks - it used to be seven meters .
algae cause death zones in the water algae blooms can be disastrous for ecoystems , causing dead zones under water .
they suck up the oxygen , leaving none for plants and animals .
" this is especially bad for fish , crawfish , starfish and crabs living in the ground .
their lives are severely affected and in the worst case they die , " says wera leujak , specialist for oceanic security at the german federal environment agency .
the baltic sea already has quite a number of these dead zones , but the algae exacerbate them .
for humans , the blue-green algae are unhealthy as well .
they can cause skin rashes , allergic reactions or diarrhoea and damage the liver .
bildunterschrift : the blue-green algae bloom can even be seen from space clear water , clear samples yet despite a media uproar in europe this week , the situation is not that much worse than normal .
on thursday , a research ship took water samples from the baltic sea on the west coast of ruegen .
" at least for this area , we can give the all-clear , " said harald stegemann , head of the state environmental office for mecklenburg-western pomerania in guestrow , who initiated the operation .
" the samples looked like tap water and the colleagues on board did n't see any algae carpets , although we expected it to be different . "
on other parts of the baltic sea algae are visible .
" there are these tiny little algae floating around and colouring the water green and yellowish , " said thomas merck .
he works on the small island of vilm near ruegen and has lived there for a couple of years now .
" speaking from experience , all i can say is : it just happens regularly . "
algae comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , beaches have stayed open - with a bit of rain the algae may even disappear .
for this reason , local scientists are reluctant to join the hysteria .
of course the area looks huge on satellite images .
" but the important question is : is it just a film of two or three millimeters or is it a real carpet of two or three centimeters ? "
stegemann explains .
for him , it does not seem to be very dramatic , though he concedes that sufficient data has not yet been gathered to dismiss the problem out of hand .
in any event , the carpet may well disappear during the next few days anyway : " if it cools down , if it gets stormy , if it rains , the water will intermingle and it 's all over , " stegemann said .

this year it seems especially bad .
the affected area is almost the size of germany and even visible from outer space .
it appears like a gigantic foul-smelling carpet , 377 000 square kilometers in size , spreading from finland to the german-polish border and to the island of ruegen .
it is the biggest algae explosion since 2005 .
a combination of farming and weather bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wwf says current conditions are ' perfect ' for algae growth it 's not just the sunny weather which is driving the bloom .
it 's also the large quantity of phosphorus in the water .
" over-fertilization is the biggest environmental problem facing the baltic , " said jochen lamp from the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in hamburg .
the phosphates are being washed off farmland and from rivers into the baltic sea .
wwf has criticized countries bordering on the baltic for their disjointed response to the problem .
on the one hand they seem eager to reduce over-fertilization , on the other they encourage farmers to use more fertilizers .
sweden for example has abolished its tax on fertilizers and in the north-eastern part of germany , in mecklenburg-western pomerania , farmers are now allowed to manure their land within a meter of dikes and creeks - it used to be seven meters .
algae cause death zones in the water algae blooms can be disastrous for ecoystems , causing dead zones under water .
they suck up the oxygen , leaving none for plants and animals .
" this is especially bad for fish , crawfish , starfish and crabs living in the ground .
their lives are severely affected and in the worst case they die , " says wera leujak , specialist for oceanic security at the german federal environment agency .

stegemann explains .
for him , it does not seem to be very dramatic , though he concedes that sufficient data has not yet been gathered to dismiss the problem out of hand .
in any event , the carpet may well disappear during the next few days anyway : " if it cools down , if it gets stormy , if it rains , the water will intermingle and it 's all over , " stegemann said .

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .
there is nothing they could do more , says carl thayer , an expert on the southeast asian affairs at the australian defense force academy . " the asean regional forum can take no position that is compulsory on all members .
and asean individual states feel it -lrb- cheonan -rrb- is a bilateral issue and they usually abhor using force and threats that they see the us is applying . " delegates also discussed myanmar 's political process and human rights situation . according to janos martonyi , the hungarian foreign minister , myanmar is at a crossroads .
he called on the country to hold fair elections and release political prisoners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean foreign minister park ui chun myanmar and south china sea the us , on the other hand also raised concerns over myanmar 's alleged nuclear activities .
on thursday , us secretary of state clinton said that north korea had recently delivered ' military material and equipment ' to myanmar and that it may be helping the military junta develop nuclear weapons .
but no concrete resolution emerged from the asean regional forum on this issue .
" because we are still lacking the smoking gun , the concrete evidence and at the moment there is a reluctance to accept the us 's position , " explains thayer . the other issue that the us raised was that of territorial disputes over islands in the south china sea .
clinton said resolving this particular issue was key to regional stability .
china , vietnam , malaysia , indonesia , brunei , singapore and the philippines all asserted their claims to resource-rich areas in the south china sea .
while china refrained from raising the matter , the us says the dispute is leading to interference in international maritime commerce and a settlement should therefore be negotiated .
observers believe this , however , is unlikely . " in 2002 they negotiated a very weak declaration on the conduct of parties .
and that initial document was supposed to be the first step towards a code of conduct .
from 2002 to 2010 , it is eight years , we have n't proceeded .
so i do n't see a prospect of a binding code of conduct anytime soon , " says thayer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south china sea islands are believed to be rich in resources influence of the us and china over the years china has become an important participant at the arf meetings .
so has the us .
thayer says the focus of us diplomacy is shifting .
under bush the us administration concentrated more on the global war on terror .
now the obama administration is showing a greater commitment to southeastern asia in response to the chinese challenge . " i think during the bush administration , china made great inroads using soft diplomacy and now the us is playing a multilateral game and that is music to asean ’ s ears , " says thayer .
" asean wants the each super power to come to it rather than the superpowers impacting it . " to enhance its partnerships and bilateral ties , the us is planning to hold a summit for southeast asian leaders in washington later this year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

apart from the regional representatives , foreign ministers from 17 other countries , such as the us and china took part in asia 's biggest security dialogue . it was no less than a war of words between us secretary of state hillary clinton and ri tong il , the spokesperson for the north korean delegation in hanoi .
the contentious issues were the sinking of the south korean warship , cheonan , in march , that the us and south korea blame on the north and the upcoming us-south korea military exercises .
clinton asked north korea or dprk to change its " aggressive " behavior .
the north 's spokesperson , while denying responsibility in the ship incident , said that his country would not tolerate the maneuver . " it is another expression of hostile policy against the dprk .
and dprk 's position is clear .
there will be physical response against the threat imposed by the united states militarily , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state secretary hillary rodham clinton asean 's limited role asean nations , for their part , have expressed deep concern over the cheonan 's sinking and the tensions on the korean peninsula .

" ladies and gentlemen , the recession is definitively over , " company sales chief tom leahy told a news conference .
" liquidity is back in the market , traffic is back in the market and gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth is back . "
leahy said he was delighted to have won a personal wager with the chief executive of parent company eads , louis gallois , having bet that airbus would double its year-to-date sales at the airshow .
the company has revised its sales estimates for 2010 upwards , now saying it expects to sell " north of 400 " planes .
perhaps the highest profile contract was with virgin atlantic , selling 40 airbus a320 jets to virgin america with the option to add another 20 , in a deal worth at least 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
" i am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week , " virgin founder richard branson said .
" and i ca n't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes . "
airbus says the deals it has either sealed or set up at the british air show will eventually be worth almost 22 billion euros , and the company is considering further increases in production of its smaller , single-aisle a320 family to cope with rising demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' a380 is the new flagship , but not the cash cow " this was a good airshow for us and i think it was a good airshow for the aviation industry , " airbus chief executive thomas enders said on thursday , after the last major day for doing business at the farnborough show , which remains open to the public until sunday .
gains across the industry airbus 's strong sales were a welcome boon at farnborough , especially after the company 's us rival boeing flew in its new 787 dreamliner for its debut appearance outside the states .
the 787 is boeing 's answer to the airbus a380 superjumbo , and although it has a lower seating capacity and shorter range , many analysts predict its comparatively modest size could make it more saleable than airbus ' record-breaking passenger jet .
boeing has reported 103 new orders worth roughly eight billion euros at the trade fair , saying this performance points to a " continued recovery " for the industry .
aviation mogul steve udvar-hazy - a pioneer of the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s - also made a big-spending return in farnborough , ordering 100 airbus and boeing jets for his new business , air lease corp , triggering more orders from rival leasing companies .
airline shares have responded positively to the performance , although the apparent spike in sales is still being fuelled by emerging markets , with airlines in europe and north america relatively cautious .
sales at the biennial farnborough trade fair may not have approached the record levels of 2008 , when almost 70 billion euros changed hands , but they 're still a massive improvement on 2009 's post-financial crisis sister air show at le bourget , near paris , when sales totaled a meager 5.4 billion euros .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .

vettel 's red bull car has been the class of the 2010 field .
but for a number of reasons , the team is n't bringing home the bacon . if seven-time champion michael schumacher 's comparatively unsuccessful formula one comeback has disappointed his legions of fans , german petrol heads have a potential , or even probable winner to cheer for at hockenheim this weekend .
sebastian vettel has further cemented his reputation as a future german world champion this season , driving probably the best car on the grid , and notching up two race wins , so far .
but vettel 's performance has been deceptively disappointing ; mechanical problems , driver errors , and the occasional display of immaturity have all combined to put the german in a mysterious fourth position in the title race , when he could have amassed a commanding lead in a more trouble-free campaign .
it 's probably fair to say the 23-year-old should have done better in the opening ten rounds of the season .
what might have been generally speaking , the fastest car on the track will win races .
but this rule is not quite as set in stone as you might think , and vettel and his red bull team have done a stellar job of disproving it in 2010 .
in qualifying , the red bull cars reign supreme , having secured pole position nine times out of ten so far .
vettel himself has started from the front in half of this season 's races , but he 's only finished there twice in ten attempts .
so , what 's going wrong ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car , team , and driver have all hampered vettel 's success rather than being beaten on the track , vettel and red bull are conspiring , in a number of ways , to beat themselves .
in bahrain , spain , and australia the car let vettel down , with mechanical problems robbing the young german of a shot at victory .
in china , red bull 's poor pit lane strategy when responding to changeable weather was to blame .
and in canada it was a similar story , with vettel 's team choosing the wrong tire strategy in a complicated race .
the youngster 's frustrated radio transmissions with the team in that race , however , pointed to perhaps his greatest weakness .
after repeatedly querying why he was so far adrift of the leaders , and while nursing a slight gearbox problem late in the race , vettel radioed in specifically to ask " what 's the fastest lap ? "
his chief mechanic sounded like an exasperated parent or schoolteacher as he blurted out the response : " do n't even think about it ! "
drivers love setting the fastest lap of a race - especially if they ca n't win or finish on the podium - but it 's an ultimately meaningless award , carrying no championship points .
from vettel 's perspective , he could salvage some honor by setting a fast lap , but you 'd never catch a successful veteran like schumacher thinking that way with championship points on the line .
this youthful exuberance and ambition -lrb- or short-sighted immaturity , depending on your perspective -rrb- helps explain the other major threat to vettel 's title charge - his strained relationship with his veteran team mate , mark webber .
inter-team timebomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't let the smiles fool you ...
three races ago in turkey , vettel and webber committed motorsport 's cardinal sin , crashing into each other while running first and second .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on his australian team mate , looking to take the lead .
webber left vettel very little space , then vettel tried to squeeze webber wide ; neither driver gave way and so the innevitable happened .
webber limped home in third , while the young german retired in the collision .
vettel walked away from his stricken car demonstratively rotating his index finger around his temple , apparently suggesting he thought webber had acted crazily .
most pundits , however , either deemed the crash a racing incident or laid the greater portion of blame at vettel 's door .
at the british grand prix two weeks ago , they were at it again .
amid a dispute over the allocation of parts by the team in qualifying , in which webber felt he was getting the short straw , the drivers again started side by side on the grid .
webber got away well from second and pulled alongside vettel , who tried to push his team mate into the wall .
the disgruntled aussie was in no mood to yield and held his ground .
out of position after this tussle , vettel was hit from behind , sustained a puncture , and could only salvage seventh place .
webber romped off to victory .
once again , vettel paid a heavy price for fighting tooth and nail with his team mate - the one car a driver is expected to treat gingerly .
know your enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel and red bull must focus on hamilton and mclaren it would be unfair to criticize vettel for having a selfish streak , that 's one of the defining characteristics of any top driver .
but vettel seems determined to fight every battle , whether he can win it or not .
webber may be a stubborn driver in his own right , but it 's probably not coincidence that the veteran australian suffered considerably less on the two occasions his young team mate tried to forcefully assert his authority .
the wily old fox may not be quite as quick as vettel , but his experience is showing .
vettel , webber , and red bull would do well to put the infighting behind them and focus on their real adversaries , the mclaren duo of lewis hamilton and jenson button .
this all-british pairing is currently running first and second in the championship - and considering the obvious superiority of the red bull car , no one can fathom how .
vettel , webber , and red bull are still well placed to mount a successful title charge , but they need to convert their speed advantage into points before it 's too late .
preferably starting this weekend at germany 's hockenheim circuit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.07.2010 seven european banks fail eu stress tests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european markets will rise or fall on the test results european banking regulators have released the results of their so-called stress tests .
many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

dw-world.de too good to be true ?
doubts surface over eu bank stress tests on friday regulators release the results of " stress tests " carried out on banks to determine their health .
but markets are worried that the results wo n't mean much since the tests may not have been rigorous enough .

many eu lenders had been confident of being given a clean bill of health , and a fresh injection of investor confidence . european banks were awaiting a potential panacea as regulators prepared to release the results of their banking stress test on friday .
most of the 91 financial institutions , including 14 german banks , were confident of receiving a clean bill of health .
the tests were ordered to assess whether europe 's banks could survive future economic crises , and are aimed at boosting investor confidence in the rattled eurozone .
the banks being examined by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors represent 65 percent of the european union banking sector .
european governments have remained upbeat about the results , though the tests were expected to show that some lenders would require cash injections under certain scenarios .
the german banks under the microscope include deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank , hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or state banks .
many analysts rightly believed hre was unlikely to pass the stress test after it became a prominent german victim of the global financial crisis and came close to collapse in 2008 .
the bank stayed afloat thanks to government loan guarantees and cash injections .
market expert michael best said many banks , particularly in germany , were reluctant to agree to publication of the stress test results , arguing that business secrets could be divulged and hasty conclusions drawn on the status of financial markets .
german confidence , spanish jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate require a bailout from the german government despite this , manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks , told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk he was confident german banks " all in all " would perform well in the tests .
the governments in great britain and ireland , meanwhile , are reported to have few fears over the tests .
the british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister , george osborne , has already stated that none of the banks in the united kingdom would need state help , while in dublin there are few concerns the stress test will shed any more light on the troubles of one of the country 's big four banks , aib , which received financial aid in 2009 .
in spain , however , fears were growing ahead of the test results , with daily el pais reporting , correctly as it turned out , that several of the country 's 18 banks being tested had failed .
markets respond positively markets surged higher on thursday , with leading banks anticipating passing the crucial tests on their financial well-being .
" the rally we 've seen in the banking sector yesterday signal that the stress test results have been well anticipated , thanks to all the comments already made by officials , " ig markets analyst philippe de vandiere told news agency reuters .
" but i think that even if the tests are good , investors will take it as an opportunity to book profits after the strong run-up to the tests . "

the call comes as the oil spill in the gulf of mexico near its 15th week . with the bp oil spill fiasco in the gulf of mexico entering its fourth month , germany 's environment minister , norbert roettgen , has called for a moratorium on new oil drilling in the north sea .
roettgen said the measure should be taken until an investigation can determine exactly what went wrong in the oil rig explosion that led to the spill off the united states coast , which has become the country 's worst-ever environmental disaster .
" we take risks , but we ca n't take every risk , " roettgen told public broadcaster zdf .
" without safety there can be no drilling . "
roettgen said , however , he doubted that other north sea countries would go along with a moratorium .
he added that environmental and safety standards applied to north sea drilling operations differed from those used in the united states .
countries straddling the north sea include norway , denmark , the netherlands , belgium , france , britain and germany .
the calls by the german environment minister come two weeks after european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger called for a halt on deep sea drilling - a demand that was rebuffed by a number of eu states , including the uk .
individual eu member states are responsible for approving or rejecting drilling proposals in their own waters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.07.2010 aids conference delegates make call to protect funding - and sufferers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with times tough economically , aids funding is suffering at the world ’ s largest meeting of aids experts and activists in vienna , there were many achievements to be positive about .
however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

however , there are fears that success in fighting the spread of hiv could lead to complacency . some 20,000 clinicians , policymakers and grassroots workers attended the international aids 2010 conference in vienna , as well as the occasional celebrity .
among the major conference themes were the need for more money to fight the spread of hiv and aids and to protect the rights of aids sufferers .
conference-goers heard about scientific advances that were being made to stop the spread of the virus , including a vaginal gel that could prevent women from contracting it .
in addition , therapies using cocktails of drugs that prevent hiv from replicating inside the body were declared safer and more effective than ever by the un 's world health organization .
call for vigilance among those taking part in an accompanying street demonstration was scottish singer and social activist annie lennox .
she sees progress in the fight against aids also bearing the danger of complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer annie lennox is concerned that complacency is growing stronger " fortunately all of the work that people have done in trying to make some sort of u-turn is succeeding , " said lennox .
" the worry is that we back away from it now because we say we 've made some progress .
that is a huge concern because then again we will see the mortality rates coming up and all the good work that 's been done will be undone . "
among the themes was the need for richer countries to do more by giving more money to the global fund to fight aids .
figures issued at the six-day forum showed western donors in 2009 contributed less than in 2008 - the first annual reduction in funding for six years .
host country austria came in for special criticism with many delegates pointing out that it had given only 1.1 million dollars -lrb- 774,200 euros -rrb- to the fund since it was established in 2002 .
there were also calls for the us to increase its spending .
maintaining funding at its current levels was not good enough , said chris collins from the foundation for aids research .
" hiv / aids is the biggest killer of women of child-bearing age in the world , " said collins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 33 million people are infected with hiv " it 's not clear to me how we can flatline the response to global aids when so many people are in need of treatment and hope to do better on maternal health . "
science offers some hope emphasizing the point that funding can bring results in preventing aids , scientists presented a new vaginal gel which they said could cut the risk of hiv infection in women by 50 percent .
the gel was developed and tested in south africa , where infection rates among young women are one in two at the age of 24 .
while the topic of funding dominated much of the summit , the real aim was to get human rights for hiv and aids sufferers back on the agenda .
a clear message was that criminalization of drug users and marginalization of those with aids hindered the fight against new infections .
" every form of criminalization of sex and drugs , compulsory testing , etcetera , has proved to be counter-productive , " un special rapporteur manfred nowak told the conference .
breeding grounds for virus nowak warned that overcrowded prisons are a breeding ground for aids .
he said in many countries inmates spread the hiv virus through non-sterile drug equipment and sexual contact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moving on : the next conference will be held in washington in 2012 in a final declaration the international aids conference said that the criminalization of illicit drug users is fuelling the spread of hiv and leading to overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences .
it called for a complete rethink of policies .
the conference closed with messages of support from south africa 's nobel-winning anti-apartheid campaigner , archbishop desmond tutu , and us president barack obama .
the world forum is held every two years , with the next to be held in washington .
at least 25 million people have died as a result of aids since 1981 and more than 33 million people are living with the hiv virus .

the ifo institute index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives , jumped from 101.8 points to 106.2 points , the largest gain since 1990 .
experts had been expecting a fall in business confidence .
at the heart of the recovery was a strong rise in german exports over recent months , accompanied by falling unemployment since the summer of 2009 .
" the rise is the biggest since german reunification .
firms are reporting significantly more favorable business conditions than last month , " the munich-based ifo said .
" the german economy is back in party mood . "
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , forecast earlier this month that " real gross domestic product therefore should increase at an extraordinarily strong pace in the second quarter .
" dynamic global growth remained the main driver for the german economy , " it said .
the ifo index is one of europe 's key economic indicators and is used to gauge business sentiment among industry leaders in germany , europe 's largest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 23.07.2010 us senate to probe possible links between bp and the release of the lockerbie bomber großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers want to know whether bp played a role in the release of the lockerbie bomber already under fire for the oil spill , bp has admitted lobbying the uk government over a controversial prisoner release deal with libya .
while the us senate is investigating , experts are n't surprised . the senators were incensed .
in an open letter to the us secretary of state on july 13 , four democratic lawmakers urged hillary clinton to fully investigate reports about a possible link between bp and the release of the convicted lockerbie bomber by the british government .
" the question we now have to answer is , was this corporation willing to trade justice in the murder of 270 innocent people for oil profits ? " the senators ask in their letter .
on july 29 , the senate foreign relations committee will convene a hearing on the issue . at the heart of the case is abdelbaset al-megrahi , a libyan national who was convicted of blowing up pan am flight 103 in 1988 over the scottish village of lockerbie .
270 people , including 189 americans , were killed in the downing of the airliner .
al-megrahi was released in august last year on compassionate grounds because he was diagnosed with a terminal illness .
his release and the subsequent hero 's welcome he received in libya caused a public outcry in the us .
bp lobbied for a prisoner deal , not for al-megrahi two days after the senators ' letter was published , bp admitted that it had in fact lobbied the british government in 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with libya because it was concerned a slow resolution would impact an offshore drilling deal with libya .
the prisoner deal was ultimately agreed upon by the british government in 2007 , the same year bp reached an exploration deal worth 900 million dollars with libya .
while bp admitted lobbying for the prisoner deal , it said it was not involved in discussions about the freeing of al-megrahi .
" the decision to release al-megrahi in august 2009 was taken by the scottish government , " bp said in a statement on july 15 " it is not for bp to comment on the decision of the scottish government .
bp was not involved in any such discussions about the release of al-megrahi . "
according to the oil company 's statement , " bp told the uk government that we were concerned about the slow progress that was being made in concluding a prisoner transfer agreement with libya . "
" we were aware that this could have a negative impact on uk commercial interests , including the ratification by the libyan government of bp 's exploration agreement , " the statement read .
lobbying power house asked whether he was surprised about bp 's admitted lobbying for a controversial prisoner release deal with libya , thomas seifert , who wrote an acclaimed book on the oil industry and works as foreign affairs editor at the austrian daily " die presse " , is unequivocal : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelbaset al-megrahi was welcomed in tripoli by the libyan leader 's son , seif al-islam gadhafi " no , not at all , " he said .
" it 's about a 900 million dollar deal in libya and that 's why bp lobbied .
and that 's not a crime , and of course they can do that .
we all can lobby our governments for better schools and universities or things like that .
but of course it helps quite a bit if you have the firepower of multi-billion dollar companies to pay lobbyists who have gone the revolving door in and out of governments and have a pretty good network in the governments . "
dave levinthal , communications director with the center for responsive politics in washington , which runs the lobbying clearinghouse opensecrets.org , put the current case of bp 's lobbying for a prisoner deal in a larger context : " certainly what we see in the united states is that bp , particularly in recent years , has really spent a considerable amount of money on lobbying efforts and lobbying federal level politicians in the united states .
so it does serve to reason that they would be doing similar things , be it in britain or otherwise in europe when it comes to political lobbying . "
according to levinthal , bp spent more than 15 million dollars last year alone for lobbying the us federal government .
that ranks the company fourth among all oil and gas related corporations in terms of lobbying expenditure .
only exxonmobil , chevron , conocophilips spent more money lobbying the us government than bp .
" it 's important to note that they have a small army of lobbyists , " said levinthal .
they have literally dozens of people who lobby on their behalf and when you consider just that mere fact , they have a lot of resources to draw from . "
friends lobbying friends but perhaps even more important than the sheer amount of money poured into lobbying is the cadre of people bp hires to do the job .
" when you go a little bit deeper you notice that many of the people bp has hired as lobbyists are actually former government officials , " said levinthal .
" they are in some cases former federal level staffers , they are former congressional staffers , in some cases they are even former members of congress . "
bildunterschrift : last month , bp ceo tony hayward had to testify on capitol hill about the oil spill in the gulf of mexico for companies like bp it makes perfect sense to hire people who know the political system .
" these are people who have worked in the government , these are people who have friends in the government " , said levinthal .
" and just like if you wanted to try to convince your friend to do something , you probably have a much better chance of convincing your friend to do what you want than a perfect stranger . "
details of lobbying usually do n't become public apparently that is also how bp lobbied the british government over the prisoner transfer deal .
according to the " wall street journal , " bp told the paper that a special adviser to bp who had previously worked for the british intelligence service mi6 had raised the prisoner transfer agreement , but not the specific case of al mehgrahi , with then-justice secretary jack straw .
although it is easy to single out bp for criticism for their lobbying practices , that 's not really fair , notes thomas seifert : " if you have a certain size of an industry or of a company then basically the interest of this company might coincide with the interest of this country .
we are talking about thousands of jobs ; we are talking about providing the energy infrastructure , providing the lifeblood of our whole industrial system , so it 's pretty significant . "
what 's more , adds seifert , most other international energy companies are also engaged in lobbying all over the world to get access to oil and gas reserves .
however , what is unusual about the bp case is not necessarily the lobbying efforts themselves , but the fact that this kind of detailed information has become public .
perhaps the senators will unearth even more aspects of bp 's efforts to influence the british government in their hearing on the case .

they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .

so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .

the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .

i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.07.2010 italian autonomous car to drive from italy to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car will travel about 13,000 kilometers -lrb- 8,100 miles -rrb- between italy and china university of parma scientists have pioneered robotic cars that can navigate on their own .
they are about to drive from italy to china and plan to arrive by mid-october . in 2004 , scientists from around the world battled it out in the darpa grand challenge , the first long-distance driverless car competition held in the middle of the california desert .
of the 15 teams that competed in that event sponsored by the united states department of defense research wing -lrb- darpa -rrb- , none actually finished the course .
but researchers had two more chances , in 2005 and 2007 , and those challenges did have winners . now , an italian company called vislab , staffed by many who designed one of the vehicles in previous darpa challenges , is now taking their car to an entirely new level .
instead of driving on a pre-determined course , vislab 's car will drive , on its own , from parma , italy , to shanghai , china , over the next three months .
the team has dubbed the tour " the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge , " which will begin next week . deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma . deutsche welle : how exactly will your autonomous car get from italy to china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will check in with the car along its three-month journey alberto broggi : actually there will be two vehicles .
the first vehicle will be manned , and that vehicle will define the route .
the second vehicle will be following it automatically .
so if the first vehicle is in line of sight then the second vehicle will look at it and follow it .
if the vehicle is not visible from the second one , in that case the first vehicle broadcasts its gps position to the second one and the second one would follow a rough idea of the route given by the gps points .
this is a trick that we use . walk me through how you expect this car to function .
what exactly is it doing when it 's moving ? we have seven cameras on the car .
five in the front and two in the back .
the five in the front are divided into two systems .
one is a stereo system : two cameras .
and the other is a panoramic system : three cameras .
so the stereo system just looks in front and detects obstacles and lane markings , and let 's say close to medium-range detection .
then we have a three camera system which is a panoramic view .
we have one camera exactly in front , one sixty degrees on the right and one 60 degrees on the left .
and you put all these three images together to get one single big image of the world around .
it 's not 180 degrees , it 's a little less , but you can imagine that as a 180 degree image .
and that is used to locate the vehicle in front .
these are the two visions systems in front . plus , we have four laser scanners .
we have two simple laser scanners on the side which monitor the presence of obstacles on the left and right-hand side .
plus we have one more penetrating laser scanner in the front and that 's used to detect obstacles in the front of the vehicle .
plus we have another laser scanner which is placed on the top of the car and it looks down to detect ditches , burns , holes in the ground and it 's used for off-road driving . you 're going to be crossing a lot of territory and in a handful of different countries .
i understand that you had to get special permission to drive this type of vehicle across all these different countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai is the team 's final destination actually , luckily we are not in charge of this .
there 's another company which is with us , which is called overland .
they 're taking care of all the logistics and all the permission and the visas and so on .
they have been working on this for a number of years and they have already organized a number of extreme travel trips throughout the world .
they already know how to manage these things . but presumably they have n't done it with a robotic , autonomous car ? yes .
actually , i 've been talking to the people here in italy regarding the liability issues .
they told me that as long as there 's a guy sitting behind the steering wheel he will be responsible for that car - even if he 's not touching the steering wheel .
if you are sitting there , you are the responsible guy .
even if the car might move without anybody on board , someone will be sitting there . the darpa challenges and what you 're doing push the limits of robotics and transportation .
what applications do you see for this type of research ?
where do you do expect that it will go ?
and do you think that regular people might be able to benefit from this ? definitely .
the answer is yes , but not now .
it will take a few years .
i think that the very first application would be the agricultural domain in which you could have your autonomous tractor move along your field 24 hours a day , 7 days a week without anybody on board .
i 'm saying this because the agricultural maze is much easier than the normal city traffic .
there are military applications as well , even civil applications like road construction areas in which vehicles can move without anybody on board or for mining or in other harsh environments .
i 'm sure that one day this technology will also be on cars .

the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .

the picture for the rest of germany 's banking sector is more positive . germany 's hypo real estate bank has failed a " stress test " designed to see if it would survive another global economic crisis , as europe aims to restore confidence to its banking sector .
the news in other parts of the german banking sector was more positive with clean bills of health for deutsche bank , postbank , commerzbank and all of the country 's seven landesbanken , or regional banks .
" the german banking system has shown itself to be robust and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic assumptions , " a statement by the german central bank and financial sector stabilization fund -lrb- soffin -rrb- said friday .
the tests , to see how banks would fare under worsening economic circumstances , were aimed at boosting investor confidence in the eurozone .
while the majority of banks in europe passed the test , germany 's hypo real estate failed to show that it would emerge from a severe economic crisis with a sufficient amount of core capital .
the bank was nationalized following its collapse in 2008 .
however , soffin said that hypo real was " currently undergoing a far-reaching restructuring process under the close surveillance of its sole owner , the financial sector stabilization fund . "
the results as a whole were welcomed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble .
" the broad participation in the stress tests and the publication of the results is an important step towards more trust in the markets , " he said .
" transparency regarding the resistance capacity of the european banks has therefore clearly risen , " he said .
seven banks fail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result was bad for hypo , but changes are taking place seven out of 91 european banks failed the stress tests and show an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- , the organizers of the tests said on friday .
five of the failing financial institutions - cajasur , banca civica , diada , espiga and unnim - were spanish .
greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

greece 's ate bank also failed to make the grade .
the seven banks failed because the ratio of their core " tier one " capital - the strictest test of a bank 's equity - would fall below 6 percent under the worst economic conditions set by the test .
several other banks came close to failing the test , including postbank and nord lb , with a tier one ration of less than 7 percent under the most stressed scenario .
this prompted gerhard schick , finance spokesman for the green party , to comment on saturday that " the german banks are and remain shaky " despite being cleared by the test .
economists pointed out that many of the german , greek , spanish and irish banks to pass the stress test had already received support funds , or were in the process of doing so , ahead of the test - possibly preemptively to help them pass .
the international monetary fund welcomed the publication of the results , which it said would reassure markets .
german banks , several of which struggled during the financial crisis , had earlier been expected " all in all " to perform well , according to manfred weber , the head of the association of german banks .

the captain of the ship that carried the waste , sergiy chertov , received a five-year suspended sentence .
judge frans bauduin said trafigura " exported the waste ... to the state -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- without having done a thorough analysis of the port city of abidjan 's capacity to process the waste ... in a responsible way . "
campaigners demand more however , friday 's verdict did not address the effects of the dumping of the toxic waste on the population in and around the ivorian city of abidjan .
" it 's clear this is only the beginning , " marietta harjono , a campaigner for greenpeace , told deutsche welle .
" the most logical step now is that trafigura are brought to trial for the dumping of the waste in abidjan .
we should realize that the real impact of the dumping of waste was in africa .
but africa has been out of the picture altogether in these proceedings .
we believe that only if top managers in the company are prosecuted , true justice can be done , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30,000 victims have yet to see compensation amnesty international agrees and goes a step further by criticizing the dutch authorities .
" the verdict also appears to raise serious questions about the failures of the dutch authorities , who could have prevented the tragedy by stopping the waste from leaving dutch borders , " the organization said in a statement .
impact felt across abidjan in july 2006 , 500 tons of caustic soda and petroleum residues on board the probo koala ship were originally meant to be off-loaded in amsterdam , but a disagreement about price led to the waste being redirected to ivory coast .
there , it was dumped on several open rubbish tips in abidjan .
" it was awful .
suddenly , there was this sickly sweet smell and then we could n't breathe , especially indoors , " local resident innocent kassi told deutsche welle .
" we went out into the road , but it got worse .
we tried to breathe holding scarves in front of our mouths .
we really suffered , it was horrible , " he said .
a un report says at least 15 people died as a result of the toxic waste being dumped and many more had to be hospitalized . this contradicts an independent report commissioned by trafigura , which established no clear link between the toxic waste and the health of the local people .
trafigura still believes it is not responsible or liable and the company said on friday it would appeal the decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trafigura is the world 's third-biggest private oil firm local pressure groups , meanwhile , are furious that trafigura could get away with a settlement when thousands of locals have long-term health problems .
" trafigura bought a lot of people to keep them quiet , " rachel gogoua from the local association of victims in akuedo near abidjan told deutsche welle .
" their managers are in a good position , because they paid ivory coast 150 million euros to clean up the mess and a lot of people lined their pockets .
and that 's it for them , i think that 's criminal . "
greenpeace points out that the victims in abidjan were not able to take part in the legal proceedings against trafigura .
it says the evidence it has gathered against the company is strong and that it will keep pressing the dutch authorities to try trafigura for the intentional discharging of products that are hazardous to public health .
