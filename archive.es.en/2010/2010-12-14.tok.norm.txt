opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie zu guttenberg wanted to meet with female soldiers in particular stephanie zu guttenberg , 34 , first visited a field hospital and later met with women soldiers .
her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : the guttenbergs are often called the ' german kennedys ' for their youth and charm popular support waning the military mission in afghanistan appears to have little public support within germany , with the majority of people being in favor of a quick withdrawal . in a recent poll conducted for zdf , 70 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of a quick pullout .
currently there are around 5,000 bundeswehr personnel stationed in afghanistan , which makes it the third strongest isaf contingent after the united states and britain .
guttenberg is travelling with a large delegation that also includes two german state premiers and a talk show host , who is to record the latest edition of his television program in afghanistan , with guttenberg and several soldiers as guests .

but opposition parties complain of alleged fraud . the pdk party of kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci has won parliamentary elections , according to the country 's election commission on monday .
thaci is expected to form a coalition , although he may have trouble convincing his rivals to join him in government , as opposition parties continue to cry foul over alleged election fraud , with some refusing to serve as coalition partners .
thaci 's pdk won 33.5 percent of the vote , followed by its former coalition ally , the ldk , with 23.6 percent .
the vetevendosje party took third place with 12.2 percent .
voter turnout was just under 48 percent .
" this was a vote for the european kosovo , a referendum of citizens on our good governing , " thaci said .
opposition cries foul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.6 million people were eligible to vote in kosovo but opposition parties are concerned about electoral fraud , as some thaci strongholds showed an unusually high turnout .
" the turnout of 94 percent is statistically impossible , logically unreasonable , politically unacceptable and legally contestable in kosovo 's reality , " ldk spokesman arben gashi said of one of those strongholds .
european election monitors said they were aware of these allegations , but said it was a " generally well-organized election day , " according to doris pack , head of the european parliament observer mission .
in a joint statement , the eu 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton , and eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele praised kosovo for the " calm and orderly manner in which the majority of the voting took place . "
the elections are kosovo 's first since declaring independence from serbia in 2008 and are seen as a key test for the country 's democratic mettle and its suitability for eu membership .
the elections were called early after a vote of no-confidence was submitted two weeks after thaci 's coalition fell apart when former president fatmir sejidu pulled his party out of the governing coalition .
" it is important now to rapidly form a new government and to elect a new president , " said ashton 's and fuele 's statement .
" we have much work ahead of us in the coming year , so that kosovo can further advance towards the eu , " the statement read .

but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

some progress has been made , but many say it 's not enough . according to the european commission , the most pressing environmental concerns in turkey include water quality and radiation protection .
but in the area of nature conservation too , change has been slow to come .
moreover , recent amendments to mining laws as well as new rules regarding visas designed to boost tourism are seen as potentially highly damaging to the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air and water pollution are serious problems in istanbul guelcan nitsch , the founder of yeşil çember , the turkish branch of friends of the earth says she 's worried .
in november 2010 , she accompanied the organization 's german delegation to istanbul to talk to representatives from various turkish environmental groups . " in turkey , environmental protection is still in its infancy , " she said .
" the work we 're doing there is a bit like development aid . " organizations such as tema , bugay and greenpeace turkey have much to contend with .
for now , the government is reluctant to cooperate with them , explains nitsch , and environmental protection appears to exist only on paper .
even though she concedes that legislation exists , she stresses that its actual implementation is not sufficiently supervised . " you even see construction companies granted permission to build in conservation areas , " she despairs . anger over akkuyu ankara has other priorities , it seems .
it recently signed a contract with russia to build a nuclear power plant in akkuyu on the mediterranean coast .
scheduled for completion in 2017 , the project is expected to cost an estimated $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.8 billion euros -rrb- , and will consist of four nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 4,800-megawatts . environmental activists are up in arms , not least because akkuyu is located in an earthquake - prone region .
locals have also launched protests , and many are planning to move away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment is not yet a mainstream issue in turkey they are n't the only environmental refugees in turkey , says nitsch .
other major development ventures which have resulted in population displacement include the southeast anatolia project -lrb- gap -rrb- , which foresees 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants built in the basins of the euphrates and tigris .
the centerpiece of the project is the atatürk dam , which was completed in 1990 and is still one of the world 's largest dams . the goal of gap is to improve irrigation , hydraulic energy production , agriculture and urban and rural infrastructure .
the project is billed as a multi-sector integrated regional development initiative , based on the concept of sustainable development for the nine million people who live in the region . dawning awareness but elsewhere in the country , there 's little trace of sustainable development .
valuable carbon sinks , peat bogs and lakes in anatolia are being degraded.this not only threatens the habitat of numerous species of flora and fauna , but has far-reaching economic and social consequences for the local population . at least the problem has been recognized : at lake yenicaga and lake akgol , experts have begun studying the condition of the wetlands and are using their findings to introduce schemes that show locals how to manage the wetlands in a way that conserves their ecological functions and partially rehabilitates them . guelcan nitsch from friends of the earth believes that the population in turkey is beginning to grasp the importance of environmental protection , and hopes that it wo n't be long before it tops political agendas . before that happens , the issues needs to go mainstream .
" we want environmental groups to have more of a voice , " she says .
" but this will take some time . " the eu 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if wetlands dry up , large amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the air she says that the support of european politicians is crucial to this process .
they need to ramp up pressure on the turkish government and demand greater commitment to the environmental cause .
" europe has not been sufficiently confrontational , " agrees rebecca harms , co-leader of the green / european free alliance group in the european parliament .
turkey is currently undergoing rapid growth , and seeing a lot of investment .
" this makes it an ideal moment to address environmental issues , " says harms .
" but instead , they 're doing everything wrong .
ankara refuses to listen to criticism , and not only is the environment at stake when it comes to ambitious construction projects , cultural heritage is also at risk . "
when turkey first began negotiating eu membership , the government was far more open to criticism .
but with the accession process continuing at a relatively slow pace , ankara does n't appear to be feeling any heat .
" for as long as the eu remains a distant prospect , the issue is on the backburner , " says harms .
but she herself is undeterred , and is pinning her hopes on local environmental activists .
she plans to visit turkey in 2011 to meet them . in another hopeful sign , she 'll also be talking to egemen bagis , turkish minister for eu affairs . " he 's agreed to meet us , " she says .

some progress has been made , but many say it 's not enough . according to the european commission , the most pressing environmental concerns in turkey include water quality and radiation protection .
but in the area of nature conservation too , change has been slow to come .
moreover , recent amendments to mining laws as well as new rules regarding visas designed to boost tourism are seen as potentially highly damaging to the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air and water pollution are serious problems in istanbul guelcan nitsch , the founder of yeşil çember , the turkish branch of friends of the earth says she 's worried .
in november 2010 , she accompanied the organization 's german delegation to istanbul to talk to representatives from various turkish environmental groups . " in turkey , environmental protection is still in its infancy , " she said .
" the work we 're doing there is a bit like development aid . " organizations such as tema , bugay and greenpeace turkey have much to contend with .
for now , the government is reluctant to cooperate with them , explains nitsch , and environmental protection appears to exist only on paper .
even though she concedes that legislation exists , she stresses that its actual implementation is not sufficiently supervised . " you even see construction companies granted permission to build in conservation areas , " she despairs . anger over akkuyu ankara has other priorities , it seems .
it recently signed a contract with russia to build a nuclear power plant in akkuyu on the mediterranean coast .
scheduled for completion in 2017 , the project is expected to cost an estimated $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.8 billion euros -rrb- , and will consist of four nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 4,800-megawatts . environmental activists are up in arms , not least because akkuyu is located in an earthquake - prone region .
locals have also launched protests , and many are planning to move away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment is not yet a mainstream issue in turkey they are n't the only environmental refugees in turkey , says nitsch .
other major development ventures which have resulted in population displacement include the southeast anatolia project -lrb- gap -rrb- , which foresees 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants built in the basins of the euphrates and tigris .
the centerpiece of the project is the atatürk dam , which was completed in 1990 and is still one of the world 's largest dams . the goal of gap is to improve irrigation , hydraulic energy production , agriculture and urban and rural infrastructure .
the project is billed as a multi-sector integrated regional development initiative , based on the concept of sustainable development for the nine million people who live in the region . dawning awareness but elsewhere in the country , there 's little trace of sustainable development .
valuable carbon sinks , peat bogs and lakes in anatolia are being degraded.this not only threatens the habitat of numerous species of flora and fauna , but has far-reaching economic and social consequences for the local population . at least the problem has been recognized : at lake yenicaga and lake akgol , experts have begun studying the condition of the wetlands and are using their findings to introduce schemes that show locals how to manage the wetlands in a way that conserves their ecological functions and partially rehabilitates them . guelcan nitsch from friends of the earth believes that the population in turkey is beginning to grasp the importance of environmental protection , and hopes that it wo n't be long before it tops political agendas . before that happens , the issues needs to go mainstream .
" we want environmental groups to have more of a voice , " she says .
" but this will take some time . " the eu 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if wetlands dry up , large amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the air she says that the support of european politicians is crucial to this process .

russia ’ s central bank had announced direct exchange transactions between the yuan and the ruble in april . the yuan trading in moscow had been scheduled to begin in september , before it was postponed .
in november , china ’ s banking officials already added the russian ruble to the foreign currency basket which is currently being traded at the shanghai stock exchange .
both countries have been planning for a long time to make their currencies mutually convertible .
russia ’ s president dmitry medvedev has repeatedly called for strengthening the role of regional reserve currencies .
alternatives to the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian advocates regional reserve currencies both countries are trying to establish their currencies as alternative international reserve currencies .
especially china is eager to reduce its dependency on the us dollar for trade transactions .
beijing is also concerned since its foreign exchange holdings are mostly in us dollars .
li daokui , a member of the central bank ’ s monetary policy committee , said earlier this year that the yuan ’ s internationalization was " inevitable . "
china ’ s government plans to fully introduce the yuan into the global currency markets by between 2020 and 2025 .
intensifying bilateral trade bilateral trade between china and russia reached 45.1 billion us dollars -lrb- 30.6 billion euros -rrb- in the first ten months of 2010 , according to the chinese embassy in moscow .
this means an increase of 43.4 percent compared to last year .
" it makes sense if two huge economies want to keep the influence of a third dominant economic power house out of their bilateral trade relations , " bhanu baweja from swiss bank ubs told the bloomberg news agency .
circumventing the dollar the commencing currency trade between china and russia can also be seen as a futher sign of growing trade relations .
about 13 percent of russia ’ s imports are from china – mostly finished products .
many russian companies involved in this kind of trade will appreciate the chance to buy chinese yuan .
chinese companies mostly buy timber , coal , oil and gas from russia .
by avoiding the conversion first from rubles into us dollars and then back to the yuan , companies will save at least 0.1 to 0.3 percent of the merchandise value .
the micex even claims the benefits will be much higher , at up to five percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies will profit from direct yuan-ruble trading more flexibility the two countries have agreed to set a middle rate of 4.6711 yuan for one ruble .
the currency pair is allowed to fluctuate five percent above or below the middle rate .
this is more than the three percent of fluctuation of the yuan in trading with the dollar .
at the same time the chinese central bank will continue its efforts for a more flexible exchange rate system , pegging the yuan to a basket of currencies rather than just the us dollar .
at the beginning , the daily trade volume at the micex is expected to be three million yuan -lrb- 335 thousand euros -rrb- , a small amount compared to the four to five billion us dollars and 200-300 million euros traded every day .

co2 tied to individual consumption accounts for much of countries ' overall emissions . per capita carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions in germany dropped between 2008 and 2009 according to the latest figures , released by the federal statistics office on monday .
direct and indirect co2 emissions from private households in germany last year totaled 618 million tons - or an average of 7.5 tons per person .
though the 0.1 ton decrease over last year 's figure constitutes a small reduction , individual emissions have dropped by about 5 percent since 2000 .
" the decrease is certainly viewed as positive , " helmut mayer , an analyst with the federal statistics office , told deutsche welle in an email .
mayer said german households had already cut their energy consumption considerably .
home heating and the use of petrol for cars are forms of " direct " emissions , which totaled some 216 million tons for 2009 .
overall , direct co2 output by german households sank by nearly 7 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
as to whether that trend would continue , mayer pointed to germany 's focus on clean power sources : " domestically , the expansion of renewable energies will lead to net savings , " mayer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indirect emissions are associated with the production of consumer products not just a drop in the bucket germany 's latest figures on household emissions come on the heels of united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , which ended with a compromise agreement early saturday morning .
co2 output due to household consumption is an important part of countries ' total greenhouse gas output – a statistic calculated based on countries ' overall emissions levels .
individuals and households are responsible for 72 percent of greenhouse gas emissions , according to edgar hertwich , professor of industrial ecology at the norwegian university of science and technology .
hertwich , who was involved in the prestigious " carbon footprint of nations " research project that analyzed global co2 emissions , told deutsche welle that public consumption and investments in resources like roads and new buildings accounted for the remainder of the emissions total .
while he praised germany 's federal statistics office for taking on the topic of individual emissions , he said the reductions noted in germany were " surprising " .
" they actually contradict what we have seen from other countries in europe , " hertwich said , citing norway and the united kingdom as examples of countries whose carbon footprints are growing .
there , substantial increases in imports from toys to tv sets - especially goods produced in developing countries - has led to corresponding increases in individual emissions .
' indirect ' , consumption-related emissions measured in germany in 2009 included the output associated with the production of goods - both at home and abroad - used by german households .
this figure accounted for the bulk of germany 's total co2 output for individuals , with 402 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year .
" i would like to see the methods that were used to calculate those numbers , " hertwich added .
overall , carbon dioxide output associated with the production of consumer products dropped by 4.3 percent between 2000 and last year .
bildunterschrift : expansion of renewable energy sources has helped germany cut emissions the trends behind the trend changing consumer habits were largely responsible for the reported reductions , despite the fact that household consumption has increased overall .
germans were reportedly buying fewer tangible products and more services , which typically have a reduced carbon footprint compared to manufactured goods .
the german federal statistics office report credited more consumers switching to cars with diesel engines for part of the drop in direct emissions , while the move to natural gas from oil fuel helped slash heating-related co2 output .
but germany 's transition to carbon-neutral and other environmentally friendly sources of power has also played a major role .
about half of all co2 emissions related to the production of consumer goods are linked to energy generation .
the report said the country had increased its share of power won from renewable sources by nearly 10 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
hertwich praised germany as " one of the pioneers in renewable energy production , " but said achieving global emissions reductions targets would require " a substantial decrease " in greenhouse gas output - which could only be achieved with a carbon-free electricity sector and smart transportation solutions .
german environment minister norbert roettgen has called on europe to lead the way on that front , saying reductions are key to fulfilling the international community 's efforts to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius by 2020 .
" europe will only maintain its leading role in climate protection if we resolve to move forward and reduce our emissions by 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020 , " he told the german daily rheinische post in an interview published on monday .

co2 tied to individual consumption accounts for much of countries ' overall emissions . per capita carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions in germany dropped between 2008 and 2009 according to the latest figures , released by the federal statistics office on monday .
direct and indirect co2 emissions from private households in germany last year totaled 618 million tons - or an average of 7.5 tons per person .
though the 0.1 ton decrease over last year 's figure constitutes a small reduction , individual emissions have dropped by about 5 percent since 2000 .
" the decrease is certainly viewed as positive , " helmut mayer , an analyst with the federal statistics office , told deutsche welle in an email .
mayer said german households had already cut their energy consumption considerably .
home heating and the use of petrol for cars are forms of " direct " emissions , which totaled some 216 million tons for 2009 .
overall , direct co2 output by german households sank by nearly 7 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
as to whether that trend would continue , mayer pointed to germany 's focus on clean power sources : " domestically , the expansion of renewable energies will lead to net savings , " mayer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indirect emissions are associated with the production of consumer products not just a drop in the bucket germany 's latest figures on household emissions come on the heels of united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , which ended with a compromise agreement early saturday morning .
co2 output due to household consumption is an important part of countries ' total greenhouse gas output – a statistic calculated based on countries ' overall emissions levels .
individuals and households are responsible for 72 percent of greenhouse gas emissions , according to edgar hertwich , professor of industrial ecology at the norwegian university of science and technology .
hertwich , who was involved in the prestigious " carbon footprint of nations " research project that analyzed global co2 emissions , told deutsche welle that public consumption and investments in resources like roads and new buildings accounted for the remainder of the emissions total .
while he praised germany 's federal statistics office for taking on the topic of individual emissions , he said the reductions noted in germany were " surprising " .
" they actually contradict what we have seen from other countries in europe , " hertwich said , citing norway and the united kingdom as examples of countries whose carbon footprints are growing .
there , substantial increases in imports from toys to tv sets - especially goods produced in developing countries - has led to corresponding increases in individual emissions .
' indirect ' , consumption-related emissions measured in germany in 2009 included the output associated with the production of goods - both at home and abroad - used by german households .
this figure accounted for the bulk of germany 's total co2 output for individuals , with 402 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year .
" i would like to see the methods that were used to calculate those numbers , " hertwich added .
overall , carbon dioxide output associated with the production of consumer products dropped by 4.3 percent between 2000 and last year .
bildunterschrift : expansion of renewable energy sources has helped germany cut emissions the trends behind the trend changing consumer habits were largely responsible for the reported reductions , despite the fact that household consumption has increased overall .
germans were reportedly buying fewer tangible products and more services , which typically have a reduced carbon footprint compared to manufactured goods .
the german federal statistics office report credited more consumers switching to cars with diesel engines for part of the drop in direct emissions , while the move to natural gas from oil fuel helped slash heating-related co2 output .
but germany 's transition to carbon-neutral and other environmentally friendly sources of power has also played a major role .
about half of all co2 emissions related to the production of consumer goods are linked to energy generation .
the report said the country had increased its share of power won from renewable sources by nearly 10 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
hertwich praised germany as " one of the pioneers in renewable energy production , " but said achieving global emissions reductions targets would require " a substantial decrease " in greenhouse gas output - which could only be achieved with a carbon-free electricity sector and smart transportation solutions .
german environment minister norbert roettgen has called on europe to lead the way on that front , saying reductions are key to fulfilling the international community 's efforts to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius by 2020 .
" europe will only maintain its leading role in climate protection if we resolve to move forward and reduce our emissions by 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020 , " he told the german daily rheinische post in an interview published on monday .

but the project faces several obstacles . experts say the official agreement between turkmenistan , afghanistan , pakistan and india to construct a 1700 kilometer-long gas pipeline is a milestone .
however , the implementation of this project is going to be a herculean task .
the proposed pipeline , ashgabat 's long-cherished dream , aims to transport 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually from turkmenistan .
passing through afghanistan and pakistan , it will end in india .
afghanistan is supposed to benefit the most from this transnational pipeline , since it will receive a lucrative amount of transit fees .
besides , pakistan 's energy crisis is deepening day by day , and islamabad has been looking for various options to secure its energy needs .
security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban pose a serious threat to the proposed project construction of the pipeline is set to start in 2012 , and the four countries hope to complete it by the end of 2014 .
experts are of the view that this timeline is far from realistic , as there are serious concerns about security in afghanistan and pakistan .
the proposed pipeline will pass through the taliban strongholds in southern afghanistan - helmand and kandahar - and then through pakistan 's baluchistan province , which is also facing an endemic separatist insurgency .
the afghan government has promised to deploy up to 7,000 troops to secure the pipeline .
michael kugelman , an expert on the region at the wilson center in washington , told deutsche welle that the project was very promising for regional stability and energy security , as india and pakistan were increasingly depending on foreign energy resources .
however , he was skeptical whether the project could really take off .
" the initial question is : can this pipeline exist without getting blown up ? " said kugelman . " and that is not the only issue .
you are dealing with the partnership of two long-time enemies - india and pakistan , and you are dealing with one of the world 's most anti-democratic regimes in turkmenistan .
and another problem , particularly in the afghanistan context , is that with this new revenue source , and with a need to ensure the security along the pipeline route , it could really exacerbate corruption . "
tapi vs. ipi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian and pakistani presidents shake hands during a summit in tehran pakistan has already signed a similar agreement with iran .
the iran-pakistan-india -lrb- ipi -rrb- gas pipeline has been severely opposed by the us , which favors the turkmenistan pipeline .
islamabad is not ready to abandon the ipi and cites its severe energy crisis as a legitimate reason to undertake multiple energy projects .

but the project faces several obstacles . experts say the official agreement between turkmenistan , afghanistan , pakistan and india to construct a 1700 kilometer-long gas pipeline is a milestone .
however , the implementation of this project is going to be a herculean task .
the proposed pipeline , ashgabat 's long-cherished dream , aims to transport 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually from turkmenistan .
passing through afghanistan and pakistan , it will end in india .
afghanistan is supposed to benefit the most from this transnational pipeline , since it will receive a lucrative amount of transit fees .
besides , pakistan 's energy crisis is deepening day by day , and islamabad has been looking for various options to secure its energy needs .
security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban pose a serious threat to the proposed project construction of the pipeline is set to start in 2012 , and the four countries hope to complete it by the end of 2014 .
experts are of the view that this timeline is far from realistic , as there are serious concerns about security in afghanistan and pakistan .
the proposed pipeline will pass through the taliban strongholds in southern afghanistan - helmand and kandahar - and then through pakistan 's baluchistan province , which is also facing an endemic separatist insurgency .
the afghan government has promised to deploy up to 7,000 troops to secure the pipeline .
michael kugelman , an expert on the region at the wilson center in washington , told deutsche welle that the project was very promising for regional stability and energy security , as india and pakistan were increasingly depending on foreign energy resources .
however , he was skeptical whether the project could really take off .
" the initial question is : can this pipeline exist without getting blown up ? " said kugelman . " and that is not the only issue .
you are dealing with the partnership of two long-time enemies - india and pakistan , and you are dealing with one of the world 's most anti-democratic regimes in turkmenistan .
and another problem , particularly in the afghanistan context , is that with this new revenue source , and with a need to ensure the security along the pipeline route , it could really exacerbate corruption . "
tapi vs. ipi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian and pakistani presidents shake hands during a summit in tehran pakistan has already signed a similar agreement with iran .
the iran-pakistan-india -lrb- ipi -rrb- gas pipeline has been severely opposed by the us , which favors the turkmenistan pipeline .
islamabad is not ready to abandon the ipi and cites its severe energy crisis as a legitimate reason to undertake multiple energy projects .
india also says it has not shelved the ipi project although it is concerned about the security in pakistan .
" iran and the us do not have the best of relations .
the us , therefore , pressures both india and pakistan not to sign the iran-pakistan-india pipeline , " pakistani defense analyst ayesha siddiqua told deutsche welle .

it is now available for download , months after the game 's planned release sparked outrage among victims ' groups . the developer of a " first-person shooter " -style computer game , which lets participants take on the role of an east german border guard or escapee along the former east-west border , defended his project ahead of its release last friday evening , calling the game a way for younger generations to learn about germany 's history during the cold war .
the 24-year-old media arts student behind the controversial computer download , jens stober , said critics had never even seen the game , which was held back from its planned launch on germany 's anniversary of reunification , october 3 , following heated criticism .
" it has to be released today so that finally , everyone can form an opinion of it , " stober told a crowd of 100 gathered at the karlsruhe university of arts and design , ahead of the project 's premiere .
the game " 1378 km " - a reference to the total length of the boundary dividing east and west germany - triggered protests from victims ' advocacy groups in recent months , who argued that it was insensitive to those who had lived under east germany 's oppressive communist regime .
up to 16 gamers can play " 1378 km " at a time , and the game allows them to choose to be a border officer or an escapee in the year 1976 .
east german guards who catch a player trying to flee have three options : imprison him , escape with him , or shoot him .
but stober , who even received a death threat for creating the game , said it turned the " shoot- ' em-up " concept on its head , since points are deducted when players take aim at escapees .
" you shoot , you lose , " the game 's creator said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that it is a shooter game , the creator of ' 1378 km ' said : " you shoot , you lose . "
ongoing opposition stober 's game was still generating controversy ahead of its official launch last friday night , with the head of the uokg , a berlin-based umbrella group for victims of the communist dictatorship , calling on the university in karlsruhe not to release the game .
the uokg 's rainer wagner called for changes to be made and to " talk with the victims . "
referencing his own attempts to flee the inner-german border , which twice landed him behind bars , wagner said " 1378 km " would only serve to traumatize victims once more .
more than 100,000 east germans attempted to flee east germany between 1961 , when the border was built , and the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
according to the center for contemporary history in potsdam , 136 people were killed trying to flee along the berlin wall alone , with estimates ranging from 270 to 780 people dead along the entire border .
" do n't put the game on the internet , and do n't allow for the shooting of escapees , " wagner said . stober has said he would make changes to the game in the coming weeks but that he has no plans to remove the border soldiers component , calling it the " foundation of the game . "

" this work is an art project , and art has always tried to overstep boundaries , " the university 's head of media arts , michael bielicky said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 14.12.2010 new child protection law aims to strengthen families rather than divide them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social workers would have to visit the homes of children at risk the government has decided that the best way to help children at risk of abuse is to intervene early on .
but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say volunteers working with children should also have criminal checks .
risk of endangering vulnerable children heinz hilgers of the german association for child protection warns that there are situations where visiting a family can be counterproductive .
" if you make a house visit on the basis of a phone call from a neighbor , who might have ulterior motives , it could damage the relationship with the existing social worker , " he told deutsche welle .
" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .
i would have liked the federal government to have invested more , " hilgers told deutsche welle .
if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

but his government only has a bare majority , making it difficult for it to govern . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi narrowly survived a test of his grip on power as both houses of parliament on tuesday voted to keep him in office .
the no-confidence motion was rejected in the lower house by a razor-thin margin of 314 votes to 311 with two abstentions .
earlier berlusconi had received a more comfortable majority of confidence in the senate .
a defeat in either of the houses would have forced berlusconi to resign .
clashes with police as news of the vote spread across rome , violent protests broke out with people torching cars , smashing windows and clashing with police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi may have difficulties governing with such a slim majority police fired tear gas , and officials said around 40 protestors and at least three police officers were injured in the clashes .
the clashes coincided with a peaceful march by several thousand anti-berlusconi protestors through rome on tuesday .
many of them were students protesting cuts to university departments that the government says attract few students and take away resources from other more important areas of study .
corruption and sex scandals tuesday 's votes come after a year fraught with corruption and sex scandals involving berlusconi , who is also famous for his verbal gaffes .
in addition a split with former ally gianfranco fini has cost him a secure parliamentary majority , meaning berlusconi 's government will likely be unable to carry out any major reforms .
italy 's economy is in serious trouble and the country is carrying one of the heaviest public debt burdens in the world , running at almost 120 percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini was once berlusconi 's closest ally this and the scandals surrounding the italian government have caused the 74-year-old media tycoon 's popularity ratings to plummet .
recent surveys show that less than 30 percent of italians wanted berlusconi to finish his current term .
corruption charges but waning popularity is only one of berlusconi 's problems .
italy 's high court will soon hand down a ruling on the constitutionality of a law passed by berlusconi to protect himself from prosecution while prime minister .
if the law is deemed invalid , he will face charges of corrupting a judge .
berlusconi took power for the first time in 1994 , winning three elections and transforming italy 's political landscape .
but now , he faces some rocky times ahead .

the vote follows a split between berlusconi 's ruling coalition and rebel deputies led by ex-ally gianfranco fini in july .
if he loses either vote , he will be forced to offer his resignation to president giorgio napolitano , who will then decide whether an alternative center-right majority can be formed .
shattered reputation while berlusconi insists that italians still adore him , reality is proving different .
with a slew of sex scandals , a paralyzed economy , nationwide protests and his own loyal backers turning against him , his base of support has eroded .
despite feverish negotiations and backroom deals with rumors of cash or jobs in exchange for support , most predict the leader wo n't make it through the key vote , but analysts say he is determined to fight for survival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister has been the butt of jokes after a slew of sex scandals " his demand of the party and those close to him is complete , utter and blind loyalty , " longtime italy commentator christopher winner told deutsche welle .
" he 's attacking strongly , making it seem like he 's been unjustly challenged , and by appearing strong and unwavering , he hopes to survive what amounts to a mutiny , " he added .
allegations of corruption mutiny is not berlusconi 's only problem .
italy 's high court is poised to rule on whether a law berlusconi had passed to protect himself from prosecution while prime minister is constitutional .
if struck down , he will immediately face charges for corrupting a judge .
antonio di pietro is the former judge renowned for prosecuting corrupt businessmen and politicians in the clean hands investigations of the early 1990s .
now an opposition politician , di pietro says berlusconi 's whole political career is tied to his business problems .
" berlusconi entered politics as a legal strategy , " he said .
" he went into politics to change the laws he was breaking .
so if his sole reason to go into politics was to change the laws to get him off corruption charges , it 's easy to understand why he 's been bad for the country . "
more and more italians appear to agree with di pietro .
latest polls show that fewer than 30 percent of italians want berlusconi to finish his current term .
politicians opposing him would like to put together short-term coalition government with someone else at the helm .
but berlusconi is threatening to call an election if he loses the no-confidence vote - something most italians do not want .

but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say volunteers working with children should also have criminal checks .
risk of endangering vulnerable children heinz hilgers of the german association for child protection warns that there are situations where visiting a family can be counterproductive .
" if you make a house visit on the basis of a phone call from a neighbor , who might have ulterior motives , it could damage the relationship with the existing social worker , " he told deutsche welle .
" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .

if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.12.2010 openleaks aims to provide a more transparent alternative to wikileaks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel domscheit-berg is a co-founder of openleaks in an interview with dw , openleaks co-founder daniel domscheit-berg compares his new site to wikileaks .
he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .

but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit . even though german chancellor angela merkel has tried hard to squelch talk about issuing common european bonds , the idea is far from dead and is expected to generate plenty of debate at the next european union finance ministers ' summit , which begins on thursday .
" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

authorities said there was no suspected link to terrorist groups . german security officials conducted raids on two alleged islamist groups in three states on tuesday , suspecting the groups were involved in anti-constitutional activities .
authorities searched property belonging to the groups invitation to paradise , with offices in moenchengladbach and braunschweig , and the islamic cultural center of bremen , in the city-state on the north sea coast , as well as the private residences of some members .
the interior ministry said in a statement that both organizations were suspected of working against constitutional order to establish an islamic state in germany , and that the raids had been planned for some time and were " in no way connected to the threat of international terrorism . "
prominent member the statement also described the groups as " salafist , " an extreme brand of islamic fundamentalism which the federal office for the protection of the constitution says does not strictly condemn the use of violence .
a prominent member of invitation to paradise is the convert and boxer-turned-preacher pierre vogel , also known as abu hamza , who has appeared on talk shows advocating for the introduction of sharia law in germany .

he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie zu guttenberg wanted to meet with female soldiers in particular stephanie zu guttenberg , 34 , first visited a field hospital and later met with women soldiers .
her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : the guttenbergs are often called the ' german kennedys ' for their youth and charm popular support waning the military mission in afghanistan appears to have little public support within germany , with the majority of people being in favor of a quick withdrawal . in a recent poll conducted for zdf , 70 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of a quick pullout .
currently there are around 5,000 bundeswehr personnel stationed in afghanistan , which makes it the third strongest isaf contingent after the united states and britain .
guttenberg is travelling with a large delegation that also includes two german state premiers and a talk show host , who is to record the latest edition of his television program in afghanistan , with guttenberg and several soldiers as guests .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie zu guttenberg wanted to meet with female soldiers in particular stephanie zu guttenberg , 34 , first visited a field hospital and later met with women soldiers .
her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : the guttenbergs are often called the ' german kennedys ' for their youth and charm popular support waning the military mission in afghanistan appears to have little public support within germany , with the majority of people being in favor of a quick withdrawal . in a recent poll conducted for zdf , 70 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of a quick pullout .
currently there are around 5,000 bundeswehr personnel stationed in afghanistan , which makes it the third strongest isaf contingent after the united states and britain .
guttenberg is travelling with a large delegation that also includes two german state premiers and a talk show host , who is to record the latest edition of his television program in afghanistan , with guttenberg and several soldiers as guests .

but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

every year , people in europe spend billions at this time of year .
for many manufacturers and retailers , it 's the best month of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : kathrin m. · country : mexico christmas time is ment to be a " stop " in this stressful world .
even if it is seasoned with presents and decoration items , those must not be expensive .
one could very well step down a bit and not be carried by the race of " the expensier , the better " .
it could be just a nice " detail " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : ganesh k. · country : india in these hardtimes , overspending during christmas is not expected from germans who are doing well compared to their recession hit neighbours .
moreover consuming luxury goods will not help german economy whose major exports are excellent engineering , goods and hi-tech products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : george b. · country : usa i think the whole business of christmas reflects a healthy trend in germany .
having lived in germany for the past three years i found the spirit of the christmas markets and the stores to be a great opportunity for people to mix with each other and also to support both large and small businesses .
i think this contrasts with the united states where christmas has become too commercial and we do not even wish each other merry christmas , but rather happy holidays .

but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit . even though german chancellor angela merkel has tried hard to squelch talk about issuing common european bonds , the idea is far from dead and is expected to generate plenty of debate at the next european union finance ministers ' summit , which begins on thursday .
" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.12.2010 openleaks aims to provide a more transparent alternative to wikileaks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel domscheit-berg is a co-founder of openleaks in an interview with dw , openleaks co-founder daniel domscheit-berg compares his new site to wikileaks .
he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

this is reflected in the current economic data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ifo-index , says jochen möbert of deutsche bank economic research , has increased another time .
german economics are booming . even the logistic sector , not benefitting of the recovery before , is now catching up due to the high export demand and the investments worldwide . but möbert warns : a lot of european politicians are not aware of the problems in the euro zone and the uncertain future of the common currency .

in the case of greece , it was mainly a persistently unsound fiscal policy that led to a loss of confidence among investors , while in ireland this was primarily due to a credit bubble which had inflated the size of the financial sector . " bail-out for german municipalities " in three federal states saxony-anhalt , lower saxony and rhine-land-palatinate bail-out programmes for municipalities have already been set up in the course of 2010 .
in other federal states including north rhine-westphalia and hesse as well as to some extent in schleswig-holstein and saarland they are being discussed or similar measures are in the offing . education opportunities may be key to attracting bright minds to germany the fact that germany needs qualified immigration is not at issue among experts .
however , critics are right in pointing out that qualified foreigners show limited interest in working in germany .
it would thus be more promising to attract bright young people to germany by offering them a good education . innovative capacity in the aftermath of the crisis companies in germany kept their r & d spending at least constant even in the crisis year 2009 .
this is a good foundation for ensuring they remain competitive in future .
one explanation for what is a very robust reaction from a historical perspective is that particularly technologically advanced companies can ’ t afford not to invest in r & d precisely on account of the stiff competition .
investment in innovative start-ups and patent filings have , by contrast , been hit harder by the financial and economic crisis .
this shows that companies ’ top priority is to safeguard their current research cycles but they are less inclined to develop completely new innovations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit . even though german chancellor angela merkel has tried hard to squelch talk about issuing common european bonds , the idea is far from dead and is expected to generate plenty of debate at the next european union finance ministers ' summit , which begins on thursday .
" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.12.2010 tactics and discipline are the keys to dortmund ’ s superlative season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been no end to the celebrations for dortmund saturday ’ s win over bremen kept dortmund on course to become the bundesliga ’ s most dominant team ever .
but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

russia ’ s central bank had announced direct exchange transactions between the yuan and the ruble in april . the yuan trading in moscow had been scheduled to begin in september , before it was postponed .
in november , china ’ s banking officials already added the russian ruble to the foreign currency basket which is currently being traded at the shanghai stock exchange .
both countries have been planning for a long time to make their currencies mutually convertible .
russia ’ s president dmitry medvedev has repeatedly called for strengthening the role of regional reserve currencies .
alternatives to the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian advocates regional reserve currencies both countries are trying to establish their currencies as alternative international reserve currencies .
especially china is eager to reduce its dependency on the us dollar for trade transactions .
beijing is also concerned since its foreign exchange holdings are mostly in us dollars .
li daokui , a member of the central bank ’ s monetary policy committee , said earlier this year that the yuan ’ s internationalization was " inevitable . "
china ’ s government plans to fully introduce the yuan into the global currency markets by between 2020 and 2025 .
intensifying bilateral trade bilateral trade between china and russia reached 45.1 billion us dollars -lrb- 30.6 billion euros -rrb- in the first ten months of 2010 , according to the chinese embassy in moscow .
this means an increase of 43.4 percent compared to last year .
" it makes sense if two huge economies want to keep the influence of a third dominant economic power house out of their bilateral trade relations , " bhanu baweja from swiss bank ubs told the bloomberg news agency .
circumventing the dollar the commencing currency trade between china and russia can also be seen as a futher sign of growing trade relations .
about 13 percent of russia ’ s imports are from china – mostly finished products .
many russian companies involved in this kind of trade will appreciate the chance to buy chinese yuan .
chinese companies mostly buy timber , coal , oil and gas from russia .
by avoiding the conversion first from rubles into us dollars and then back to the yuan , companies will save at least 0.1 to 0.3 percent of the merchandise value .
the micex even claims the benefits will be much higher , at up to five percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies will profit from direct yuan-ruble trading more flexibility the two countries have agreed to set a middle rate of 4.6711 yuan for one ruble .
the currency pair is allowed to fluctuate five percent above or below the middle rate .
this is more than the three percent of fluctuation of the yuan in trading with the dollar .
at the same time the chinese central bank will continue its efforts for a more flexible exchange rate system , pegging the yuan to a basket of currencies rather than just the us dollar .
at the beginning , the daily trade volume at the micex is expected to be three million yuan -lrb- 335 thousand euros -rrb- , a small amount compared to the four to five billion us dollars and 200-300 million euros traded every day .

it has pledged that there will be an escalation of fighting with the burmese military unless the junta is ready to hold talks with the country 's ethnic minorities . thousands of new recruits have been trained over the past weeks in the jungles of the northeastern shan state , claims the commander of the shan state army , general yawd serk . unstable border region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yawd serk , leader of the shan state army he is calling on myanmar 's rebel groups to join hands in fighting the military .

the junta also struck ceasefire deals with them .

some progress has been made , but many say it 's not enough . according to the european commission , the most pressing environmental concerns in turkey include water quality and radiation protection .
but in the area of nature conservation too , change has been slow to come .
moreover , recent amendments to mining laws as well as new rules regarding visas designed to boost tourism are seen as potentially highly damaging to the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air and water pollution are serious problems in istanbul guelcan nitsch , the founder of yeşil çember , the turkish branch of friends of the earth says she 's worried .
in november 2010 , she accompanied the organization 's german delegation to istanbul to talk to representatives from various turkish environmental groups . " in turkey , environmental protection is still in its infancy , " she said .
" the work we 're doing there is a bit like development aid . " organizations such as tema , bugay and greenpeace turkey have much to contend with .
for now , the government is reluctant to cooperate with them , explains nitsch , and environmental protection appears to exist only on paper .
even though she concedes that legislation exists , she stresses that its actual implementation is not sufficiently supervised . " you even see construction companies granted permission to build in conservation areas , " she despairs . anger over akkuyu ankara has other priorities , it seems .
it recently signed a contract with russia to build a nuclear power plant in akkuyu on the mediterranean coast .
scheduled for completion in 2017 , the project is expected to cost an estimated $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.8 billion euros -rrb- , and will consist of four nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 4,800-megawatts . environmental activists are up in arms , not least because akkuyu is located in an earthquake - prone region .
locals have also launched protests , and many are planning to move away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment is not yet a mainstream issue in turkey they are n't the only environmental refugees in turkey , says nitsch .
other major development ventures which have resulted in population displacement include the southeast anatolia project -lrb- gap -rrb- , which foresees 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants built in the basins of the euphrates and tigris .
the centerpiece of the project is the atatürk dam , which was completed in 1990 and is still one of the world 's largest dams . the goal of gap is to improve irrigation , hydraulic energy production , agriculture and urban and rural infrastructure .
the project is billed as a multi-sector integrated regional development initiative , based on the concept of sustainable development for the nine million people who live in the region . dawning awareness but elsewhere in the country , there 's little trace of sustainable development .
valuable carbon sinks , peat bogs and lakes in anatolia are being degraded.this not only threatens the habitat of numerous species of flora and fauna , but has far-reaching economic and social consequences for the local population . at least the problem has been recognized : at lake yenicaga and lake akgol , experts have begun studying the condition of the wetlands and are using their findings to introduce schemes that show locals how to manage the wetlands in a way that conserves their ecological functions and partially rehabilitates them . guelcan nitsch from friends of the earth believes that the population in turkey is beginning to grasp the importance of environmental protection , and hopes that it wo n't be long before it tops political agendas . before that happens , the issues needs to go mainstream .
" we want environmental groups to have more of a voice , " she says .
" but this will take some time . " the eu 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if wetlands dry up , large amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the air she says that the support of european politicians is crucial to this process .
they need to ramp up pressure on the turkish government and demand greater commitment to the environmental cause .
" europe has not been sufficiently confrontational , " agrees rebecca harms , co-leader of the green / european free alliance group in the european parliament .
turkey is currently undergoing rapid growth , and seeing a lot of investment .
" this makes it an ideal moment to address environmental issues , " says harms .
" but instead , they 're doing everything wrong .
ankara refuses to listen to criticism , and not only is the environment at stake when it comes to ambitious construction projects , cultural heritage is also at risk . "
when turkey first began negotiating eu membership , the government was far more open to criticism .
but with the accession process continuing at a relatively slow pace , ankara does n't appear to be feeling any heat .
" for as long as the eu remains a distant prospect , the issue is on the backburner , " says harms .
but she herself is undeterred , and is pinning her hopes on local environmental activists .
she plans to visit turkey in 2011 to meet them . in another hopeful sign , she 'll also be talking to egemen bagis , turkish minister for eu affairs . " he 's agreed to meet us , " she says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 14.12.2010 new child protection law aims to strengthen families rather than divide them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social workers would have to visit the homes of children at risk the government has decided that the best way to help children at risk of abuse is to intervene early on .
but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say volunteers working with children should also have criminal checks .
risk of endangering vulnerable children heinz hilgers of the german association for child protection warns that there are situations where visiting a family can be counterproductive .
" if you make a house visit on the basis of a phone call from a neighbor , who might have ulterior motives , it could damage the relationship with the existing social worker , " he told deutsche welle .
" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .
i would have liked the federal government to have invested more , " hilgers told deutsche welle .
if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

judge howard riddle granted assange release on a 200,000-pound -lrb- 236,000 euros , $ 315,000 -rrb- bail ahead of another hearing on jan .
11 , but his release was delayed as prosecutors representing sweden said they would appeal the decision .
riddle ordered assange to remain in custody until a new hearing is held within 48 hours .
several of assange 's supporters have offered to pay his bail for him .
he would have to wear an electronic tag to monitor his location as part of the conditions of his release .
earlier in the day assange relayed a message through his mother christine , who reportedly traveled from her native australia to be with her son , saying his " convictions are unfaltering " and that he remains " true to the ideals " he has expressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange gave himself up to police on december 7 " these circumstances shall not shake them , " he said .
" if anything , this process has increased my determination that they are true and correct . "
assange has said the sex charges in sweden are fabrications designed to silence him and his organization , and that they stem from a dispute over " consensual but unprotected sex . "
visa , mastercard and paypal criticized in the statement , assange also criticized major finance companies visa , mastercard and paypal for suspending payments to his wikileaks site , claiming they were under us control as " instruments of foreign policy . "
he called on the world " to protect my work and my people from these illegal and immoral acts . "
last week internet activists managed to shut down the visa and mastercard sites as well as that of the swedish government in protest to their perceived obstruction of wikileaks 's operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks said it would release the remainder of the 250,000 diplomatic cables wikileaks has denied any involvement in the attacks or contact with the activists .
anger in washington wikileaks has caused anger in washington by publishing sensitive us diplomatic cables , and has pledged to make public all the 250,000 embassy documents it has obtained .
assange and his lawyers have voiced fears that us prosecutors may intend to indict him for espionage after the wikileaks website published the documents .
even if he is cleared of the sexual assault charges , he may soon be in the dock facing a completely different set of accusations .

he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 14.12.2010 tapi : still in the pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of four countries inked a pipeline deal on the weekend despite security concerns , an agreement about the turkmenistan-afghanistan-pakistan-india -lrb- tapi -rrb- gas pipeline project was signed in turkmenistan 's capital ashgabat last weekend .
but the project faces several obstacles . experts say the official agreement between turkmenistan , afghanistan , pakistan and india to construct a 1700 kilometer-long gas pipeline is a milestone .
however , the implementation of this project is going to be a herculean task .
the proposed pipeline , ashgabat 's long-cherished dream , aims to transport 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually from turkmenistan .
passing through afghanistan and pakistan , it will end in india .
afghanistan is supposed to benefit the most from this transnational pipeline , since it will receive a lucrative amount of transit fees .
besides , pakistan 's energy crisis is deepening day by day , and islamabad has been looking for various options to secure its energy needs .
security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban pose a serious threat to the proposed project construction of the pipeline is set to start in 2012 , and the four countries hope to complete it by the end of 2014 .
experts are of the view that this timeline is far from realistic , as there are serious concerns about security in afghanistan and pakistan .
the proposed pipeline will pass through the taliban strongholds in southern afghanistan - helmand and kandahar - and then through pakistan 's baluchistan province , which is also facing an endemic separatist insurgency .
the afghan government has promised to deploy up to 7,000 troops to secure the pipeline .
michael kugelman , an expert on the region at the wilson center in washington , told deutsche welle that the project was very promising for regional stability and energy security , as india and pakistan were increasingly depending on foreign energy resources .
however , he was skeptical whether the project could really take off .
" the initial question is : can this pipeline exist without getting blown up ? " said kugelman . " and that is not the only issue .
you are dealing with the partnership of two long-time enemies - india and pakistan , and you are dealing with one of the world 's most anti-democratic regimes in turkmenistan .
and another problem , particularly in the afghanistan context , is that with this new revenue source , and with a need to ensure the security along the pipeline route , it could really exacerbate corruption . "
tapi vs. ipi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian and pakistani presidents shake hands during a summit in tehran pakistan has already signed a similar agreement with iran .
the iran-pakistan-india -lrb- ipi -rrb- gas pipeline has been severely opposed by the us , which favors the turkmenistan pipeline .
islamabad is not ready to abandon the ipi and cites its severe energy crisis as a legitimate reason to undertake multiple energy projects .
india also says it has not shelved the ipi project although it is concerned about the security in pakistan .
" iran and the us do not have the best of relations .
the us , therefore , pressures both india and pakistan not to sign the iran-pakistan-india pipeline , " pakistani defense analyst ayesha siddiqua told deutsche welle .
she emphasized that the existing agreements are basically mous -lrb- memorandums of understanding -rrb- , and it is yet to be seen which project would eventually become a reality .
according to michael kugelman , washington does not like strengthening iran , however , pakistan 's and india 's energy needs are immense .
" i can imagine that the us is not pleased , but it is important to be realistic .
pakistan and india are both very energy insecure countries .
these countries are going to need to do what is in their best interest , and if it involves working with countries like iran , then so be it . "
still worth pursuing despite many controversies surrounding the project , tapi is believed to be beneficial for all the countries involved .
according to afghanistan 's minister of mines and industries , wahidullah shahrani , the gas pipeline will generate thousands of jobs in afghanistan .
he hopes that the economic benefit of the project will be such that the local people will themselves protect the pipeline .
" the entire region has a great need for energy resources .
whether it comes from iran or turkmenistan is not important , " said ayesha siddiqua .

but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit . even though german chancellor angela merkel has tried hard to squelch talk about issuing common european bonds , the idea is far from dead and is expected to generate plenty of debate at the next european union finance ministers ' summit , which begins on thursday .
" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

judge howard riddle granted assange release on a 200,000-pound -lrb- 236,000 euros , $ 315,000 -rrb- bail ahead of another hearing on jan .
11 , but his release was delayed as prosecutors representing sweden said they would appeal the decision .
riddle ordered assange to remain in custody until a new hearing is held within 48 hours .
several of assange 's supporters have offered to pay his bail for him .
he would have to wear an electronic tag to monitor his location as part of the conditions of his release .
earlier in the day assange relayed a message through his mother christine , who reportedly traveled from her native australia to be with her son , saying his " convictions are unfaltering " and that he remains " true to the ideals " he has expressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange gave himself up to police on december 7 " these circumstances shall not shake them , " he said .
" if anything , this process has increased my determination that they are true and correct . "
assange has said the sex charges in sweden are fabrications designed to silence him and his organization , and that they stem from a dispute over " consensual but unprotected sex . "
visa , mastercard and paypal criticized in the statement , assange also criticized major finance companies visa , mastercard and paypal for suspending payments to his wikileaks site , claiming they were under us control as " instruments of foreign policy . "
he called on the world " to protect my work and my people from these illegal and immoral acts . "
last week internet activists managed to shut down the visa and mastercard sites as well as that of the swedish government in protest to their perceived obstruction of wikileaks 's operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks said it would release the remainder of the 250,000 diplomatic cables wikileaks has denied any involvement in the attacks or contact with the activists .
anger in washington wikileaks has caused anger in washington by publishing sensitive us diplomatic cables , and has pledged to make public all the 250,000 embassy documents it has obtained .
assange and his lawyers have voiced fears that us prosecutors may intend to indict him for espionage after the wikileaks website published the documents .
even if he is cleared of the sexual assault charges , he may soon be in the dock facing a completely different set of accusations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 14.12.2010 germans ' carbon footprints are shrinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from what they drive to how they heat their homes , germans are cutting household co2 emissions germany 's transition to renewable energy sources has helped it reduce household carbon dioxide output over the last decade .
co2 tied to individual consumption accounts for much of countries ' overall emissions . per capita carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions in germany dropped between 2008 and 2009 according to the latest figures , released by the federal statistics office on monday .
direct and indirect co2 emissions from private households in germany last year totaled 618 million tons - or an average of 7.5 tons per person .
though the 0.1 ton decrease over last year 's figure constitutes a small reduction , individual emissions have dropped by about 5 percent since 2000 .
" the decrease is certainly viewed as positive , " helmut mayer , an analyst with the federal statistics office , told deutsche welle in an email .
mayer said german households had already cut their energy consumption considerably .
home heating and the use of petrol for cars are forms of " direct " emissions , which totaled some 216 million tons for 2009 .
overall , direct co2 output by german households sank by nearly 7 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
as to whether that trend would continue , mayer pointed to germany 's focus on clean power sources : " domestically , the expansion of renewable energies will lead to net savings , " mayer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indirect emissions are associated with the production of consumer products not just a drop in the bucket germany 's latest figures on household emissions come on the heels of united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , which ended with a compromise agreement early saturday morning .
co2 output due to household consumption is an important part of countries ' total greenhouse gas output – a statistic calculated based on countries ' overall emissions levels .
individuals and households are responsible for 72 percent of greenhouse gas emissions , according to edgar hertwich , professor of industrial ecology at the norwegian university of science and technology .
hertwich , who was involved in the prestigious " carbon footprint of nations " research project that analyzed global co2 emissions , told deutsche welle that public consumption and investments in resources like roads and new buildings accounted for the remainder of the emissions total .
while he praised germany 's federal statistics office for taking on the topic of individual emissions , he said the reductions noted in germany were " surprising " .
" they actually contradict what we have seen from other countries in europe , " hertwich said , citing norway and the united kingdom as examples of countries whose carbon footprints are growing .
there , substantial increases in imports from toys to tv sets - especially goods produced in developing countries - has led to corresponding increases in individual emissions .
' indirect ' , consumption-related emissions measured in germany in 2009 included the output associated with the production of goods - both at home and abroad - used by german households .
this figure accounted for the bulk of germany 's total co2 output for individuals , with 402 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year .
" i would like to see the methods that were used to calculate those numbers , " hertwich added .
overall , carbon dioxide output associated with the production of consumer products dropped by 4.3 percent between 2000 and last year .
bildunterschrift : expansion of renewable energy sources has helped germany cut emissions the trends behind the trend changing consumer habits were largely responsible for the reported reductions , despite the fact that household consumption has increased overall .
germans were reportedly buying fewer tangible products and more services , which typically have a reduced carbon footprint compared to manufactured goods .
the german federal statistics office report credited more consumers switching to cars with diesel engines for part of the drop in direct emissions , while the move to natural gas from oil fuel helped slash heating-related co2 output .
but germany 's transition to carbon-neutral and other environmentally friendly sources of power has also played a major role .
about half of all co2 emissions related to the production of consumer goods are linked to energy generation .
the report said the country had increased its share of power won from renewable sources by nearly 10 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
hertwich praised germany as " one of the pioneers in renewable energy production , " but said achieving global emissions reductions targets would require " a substantial decrease " in greenhouse gas output - which could only be achieved with a carbon-free electricity sector and smart transportation solutions .
german environment minister norbert roettgen has called on europe to lead the way on that front , saying reductions are key to fulfilling the international community 's efforts to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius by 2020 .
" europe will only maintain its leading role in climate protection if we resolve to move forward and reduce our emissions by 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020 , " he told the german daily rheinische post in an interview published on monday .

"
the silicon valley titan dismisses the 100-page opinion . on tuesday , the french autorité de la concurrence -lrb- competition authority -rrb- declared that " google holds a dominant position on the advertising market linked to search engines . "
in a 100-page opinion posted to its website , the authority noted that french competition law " can apply limits to google 's actions and provide a response to the competitive stakes brought to light by the actors , without the need to implement sector-wide regulations . "
this declaration comes less than a month after the european commission began its antitrust investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
the document outlines three main sources of complaint against google , which include competing search engines , website editors , and the press .
in addition to calling for google to be more transparent in advertising , the authority raised the possibility of an online expansion of the " sapin law , " a 1993 french law that creates more transparency in advertising rates , which forces comapnies to reconcile the published prices for advertising time and space with the actual price charged .
google rejects french regulatory opinion in addition , the french government entity wants french media outlets to be able to " request and obtain exclusion from google news , but without necessarily being delisted by the google search engine . "
in a statement emailed tuesday to deutsche welle , the company called the french analysis " too narrow . "
" search ads are one of many options for advertisers , " google said .
" if the price of search ads rises , advertisers can and do switch to other formats , both online and offline .
that 's the sign of a competitive and dynamic industry . "

it is now available for download , months after the game 's planned release sparked outrage among victims ' groups . the developer of a " first-person shooter " -style computer game , which lets participants take on the role of an east german border guard or escapee along the former east-west border , defended his project ahead of its release last friday evening , calling the game a way for younger generations to learn about germany 's history during the cold war .
the 24-year-old media arts student behind the controversial computer download , jens stober , said critics had never even seen the game , which was held back from its planned launch on germany 's anniversary of reunification , october 3 , following heated criticism .
" it has to be released today so that finally , everyone can form an opinion of it , " stober told a crowd of 100 gathered at the karlsruhe university of arts and design , ahead of the project 's premiere .
the game " 1378 km " - a reference to the total length of the boundary dividing east and west germany - triggered protests from victims ' advocacy groups in recent months , who argued that it was insensitive to those who had lived under east germany 's oppressive communist regime .
up to 16 gamers can play " 1378 km " at a time , and the game allows them to choose to be a border officer or an escapee in the year 1976 .
east german guards who catch a player trying to flee have three options : imprison him , escape with him , or shoot him .
but stober , who even received a death threat for creating the game , said it turned the " shoot- ' em-up " concept on its head , since points are deducted when players take aim at escapees .
" you shoot , you lose , " the game 's creator said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that it is a shooter game , the creator of ' 1378 km ' said : " you shoot , you lose . "
ongoing opposition stober 's game was still generating controversy ahead of its official launch last friday night , with the head of the uokg , a berlin-based umbrella group for victims of the communist dictatorship , calling on the university in karlsruhe not to release the game .
the uokg 's rainer wagner called for changes to be made and to " talk with the victims . "
referencing his own attempts to flee the inner-german border , which twice landed him behind bars , wagner said " 1378 km " would only serve to traumatize victims once more .
more than 100,000 east germans attempted to flee east germany between 1961 , when the border was built , and the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
according to the center for contemporary history in potsdam , 136 people were killed trying to flee along the berlin wall alone , with estimates ranging from 270 to 780 people dead along the entire border .
" do n't put the game on the internet , and do n't allow for the shooting of escapees , " wagner said . stober has said he would make changes to the game in the coming weeks but that he has no plans to remove the border soldiers component , calling it the " foundation of the game . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historians estimate hundreds of east germans died while trying to cross into west germany academic support meanwhile , the university 's vice rector uwe hochmuth said the school was prepared to engage in a dialogue with victims ' groups but that the process was dependent on the game 's release , which would allow people to form an opinion on the project .
members of the school 's faculty defended the game against moral and ethical challenges at friday 's meeting , making a case for artistic freedom .
" this work is an art project , and art has always tried to overstep boundaries , " the university 's head of media arts , michael bielicky said .
but another person attending the discussion ahead of the game 's launch claimed " 1378 km " had nothing to do with art - and moreover , that the game failed to address the gravity of the topic : " i crossed the border , and i 'm telling you that this game is nonsense .
this was a very defining experience for me , and i 'm disappointed that a game has been made out of it . " on more than one occasion , stober has made assurances that he is well-aware of the serious nature of his game 's subject matter .
he said he envisioned the game as an interactive way for his generation to experience the country 's cold war past .
stober reportedly spent a full year conducting research for the project . earlier on saturday , the game 's website reported that stress on the server had prevented users from downloading the game but said the problem had been resolved by the afternoon . author : amanda price -lrb- dpa , epd -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 14.12.2010 new child protection law aims to strengthen families rather than divide them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social workers would have to visit the homes of children at risk the government has decided that the best way to help children at risk of abuse is to intervene early on .
but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say volunteers working with children should also have criminal checks .
risk of endangering vulnerable children heinz hilgers of the german association for child protection warns that there are situations where visiting a family can be counterproductive .
" if you make a house visit on the basis of a phone call from a neighbor , who might have ulterior motives , it could damage the relationship with the existing social worker , " he told deutsche welle .
" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .
i would have liked the federal government to have invested more , " hilgers told deutsche welle .
if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie zu guttenberg wanted to meet with female soldiers in particular stephanie zu guttenberg , 34 , first visited a field hospital and later met with women soldiers .
her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : the guttenbergs are often called the ' german kennedys ' for their youth and charm popular support waning the military mission in afghanistan appears to have little public support within germany , with the majority of people being in favor of a quick withdrawal . in a recent poll conducted for zdf , 70 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of a quick pullout .
currently there are around 5,000 bundeswehr personnel stationed in afghanistan , which makes it the third strongest isaf contingent after the united states and britain .
guttenberg is travelling with a large delegation that also includes two german state premiers and a talk show host , who is to record the latest edition of his television program in afghanistan , with guttenberg and several soldiers as guests .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie zu guttenberg wanted to meet with female soldiers in particular stephanie zu guttenberg , 34 , first visited a field hospital and later met with women soldiers .
her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : the guttenbergs are often called the ' german kennedys ' for their youth and charm popular support waning the military mission in afghanistan appears to have little public support within germany , with the majority of people being in favor of a quick withdrawal . in a recent poll conducted for zdf , 70 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of a quick pullout .
currently there are around 5,000 bundeswehr personnel stationed in afghanistan , which makes it the third strongest isaf contingent after the united states and britain .
guttenberg is travelling with a large delegation that also includes two german state premiers and a talk show host , who is to record the latest edition of his television program in afghanistan , with guttenberg and several soldiers as guests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 14.12.2010 new child protection law aims to strengthen families rather than divide them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social workers would have to visit the homes of children at risk the government has decided that the best way to help children at risk of abuse is to intervene early on .
but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say volunteers working with children should also have criminal checks .
risk of endangering vulnerable children heinz hilgers of the german association for child protection warns that there are situations where visiting a family can be counterproductive .
" if you make a house visit on the basis of a phone call from a neighbor , who might have ulterior motives , it could damage the relationship with the existing social worker , " he told deutsche welle .
" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .
i would have liked the federal government to have invested more , " hilgers told deutsche welle .
if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

judge howard riddle granted assange release on a 200,000-pound -lrb- 236,000 euros , $ 315,000 -rrb- bail ahead of another hearing on jan .
11 , but his release was delayed as prosecutors representing sweden said they would appeal the decision .
riddle ordered assange to remain in custody until a new hearing is held within 48 hours .
several of assange 's supporters have offered to pay his bail for him .
he would have to wear an electronic tag to monitor his location as part of the conditions of his release .
earlier in the day assange relayed a message through his mother christine , who reportedly traveled from her native australia to be with her son , saying his " convictions are unfaltering " and that he remains " true to the ideals " he has expressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange gave himself up to police on december 7 " these circumstances shall not shake them , " he said .
" if anything , this process has increased my determination that they are true and correct . "
assange has said the sex charges in sweden are fabrications designed to silence him and his organization , and that they stem from a dispute over " consensual but unprotected sex . "
visa , mastercard and paypal criticized in the statement , assange also criticized major finance companies visa , mastercard and paypal for suspending payments to his wikileaks site , claiming they were under us control as " instruments of foreign policy . "
he called on the world " to protect my work and my people from these illegal and immoral acts . "

some progress has been made , but many say it 's not enough . according to the european commission , the most pressing environmental concerns in turkey include water quality and radiation protection .
but in the area of nature conservation too , change has been slow to come .
moreover , recent amendments to mining laws as well as new rules regarding visas designed to boost tourism are seen as potentially highly damaging to the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air and water pollution are serious problems in istanbul guelcan nitsch , the founder of yeşil çember , the turkish branch of friends of the earth says she 's worried .
in november 2010 , she accompanied the organization 's german delegation to istanbul to talk to representatives from various turkish environmental groups . " in turkey , environmental protection is still in its infancy , " she said .
" the work we 're doing there is a bit like development aid . " organizations such as tema , bugay and greenpeace turkey have much to contend with .
for now , the government is reluctant to cooperate with them , explains nitsch , and environmental protection appears to exist only on paper .
even though she concedes that legislation exists , she stresses that its actual implementation is not sufficiently supervised . " you even see construction companies granted permission to build in conservation areas , " she despairs . anger over akkuyu ankara has other priorities , it seems .
it recently signed a contract with russia to build a nuclear power plant in akkuyu on the mediterranean coast .
scheduled for completion in 2017 , the project is expected to cost an estimated $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.8 billion euros -rrb- , and will consist of four nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 4,800-megawatts . environmental activists are up in arms , not least because akkuyu is located in an earthquake - prone region .
locals have also launched protests , and many are planning to move away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment is not yet a mainstream issue in turkey they are n't the only environmental refugees in turkey , says nitsch .
other major development ventures which have resulted in population displacement include the southeast anatolia project -lrb- gap -rrb- , which foresees 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants built in the basins of the euphrates and tigris .
the centerpiece of the project is the atatürk dam , which was completed in 1990 and is still one of the world 's largest dams . the goal of gap is to improve irrigation , hydraulic energy production , agriculture and urban and rural infrastructure .
the project is billed as a multi-sector integrated regional development initiative , based on the concept of sustainable development for the nine million people who live in the region . dawning awareness but elsewhere in the country , there 's little trace of sustainable development .
valuable carbon sinks , peat bogs and lakes in anatolia are being degraded.this not only threatens the habitat of numerous species of flora and fauna , but has far-reaching economic and social consequences for the local population . at least the problem has been recognized : at lake yenicaga and lake akgol , experts have begun studying the condition of the wetlands and are using their findings to introduce schemes that show locals how to manage the wetlands in a way that conserves their ecological functions and partially rehabilitates them . guelcan nitsch from friends of the earth believes that the population in turkey is beginning to grasp the importance of environmental protection , and hopes that it wo n't be long before it tops political agendas . before that happens , the issues needs to go mainstream .
" we want environmental groups to have more of a voice , " she says .
" but this will take some time . " the eu 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if wetlands dry up , large amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the air she says that the support of european politicians is crucial to this process .
they need to ramp up pressure on the turkish government and demand greater commitment to the environmental cause .
" europe has not been sufficiently confrontational , " agrees rebecca harms , co-leader of the green / european free alliance group in the european parliament .
turkey is currently undergoing rapid growth , and seeing a lot of investment .
" this makes it an ideal moment to address environmental issues , " says harms .
" but instead , they 're doing everything wrong .
ankara refuses to listen to criticism , and not only is the environment at stake when it comes to ambitious construction projects , cultural heritage is also at risk . "
when turkey first began negotiating eu membership , the government was far more open to criticism .
but with the accession process continuing at a relatively slow pace , ankara does n't appear to be feeling any heat .
" for as long as the eu remains a distant prospect , the issue is on the backburner , " says harms .
but she herself is undeterred , and is pinning her hopes on local environmental activists .
she plans to visit turkey in 2011 to meet them . in another hopeful sign , she 'll also be talking to egemen bagis , turkish minister for eu affairs . " he 's agreed to meet us , " she says .

some progress has been made , but many say it 's not enough . according to the european commission , the most pressing environmental concerns in turkey include water quality and radiation protection .
but in the area of nature conservation too , change has been slow to come .
moreover , recent amendments to mining laws as well as new rules regarding visas designed to boost tourism are seen as potentially highly damaging to the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air and water pollution are serious problems in istanbul guelcan nitsch , the founder of yeşil çember , the turkish branch of friends of the earth says she 's worried .
in november 2010 , she accompanied the organization 's german delegation to istanbul to talk to representatives from various turkish environmental groups . " in turkey , environmental protection is still in its infancy , " she said .
" the work we 're doing there is a bit like development aid . " organizations such as tema , bugay and greenpeace turkey have much to contend with .
for now , the government is reluctant to cooperate with them , explains nitsch , and environmental protection appears to exist only on paper .
even though she concedes that legislation exists , she stresses that its actual implementation is not sufficiently supervised . " you even see construction companies granted permission to build in conservation areas , " she despairs . anger over akkuyu ankara has other priorities , it seems .
it recently signed a contract with russia to build a nuclear power plant in akkuyu on the mediterranean coast .
scheduled for completion in 2017 , the project is expected to cost an estimated $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.8 billion euros -rrb- , and will consist of four nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 4,800-megawatts . environmental activists are up in arms , not least because akkuyu is located in an earthquake - prone region .
locals have also launched protests , and many are planning to move away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment is not yet a mainstream issue in turkey they are n't the only environmental refugees in turkey , says nitsch .
other major development ventures which have resulted in population displacement include the southeast anatolia project -lrb- gap -rrb- , which foresees 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants built in the basins of the euphrates and tigris .
the centerpiece of the project is the atatürk dam , which was completed in 1990 and is still one of the world 's largest dams . the goal of gap is to improve irrigation , hydraulic energy production , agriculture and urban and rural infrastructure .
the project is billed as a multi-sector integrated regional development initiative , based on the concept of sustainable development for the nine million people who live in the region . dawning awareness but elsewhere in the country , there 's little trace of sustainable development .
valuable carbon sinks , peat bogs and lakes in anatolia are being degraded.this not only threatens the habitat of numerous species of flora and fauna , but has far-reaching economic and social consequences for the local population . at least the problem has been recognized : at lake yenicaga and lake akgol , experts have begun studying the condition of the wetlands and are using their findings to introduce schemes that show locals how to manage the wetlands in a way that conserves their ecological functions and partially rehabilitates them . guelcan nitsch from friends of the earth believes that the population in turkey is beginning to grasp the importance of environmental protection , and hopes that it wo n't be long before it tops political agendas . before that happens , the issues needs to go mainstream .
" we want environmental groups to have more of a voice , " she says .
" but this will take some time . " the eu 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if wetlands dry up , large amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the air she says that the support of european politicians is crucial to this process .
they need to ramp up pressure on the turkish government and demand greater commitment to the environmental cause .
" europe has not been sufficiently confrontational , " agrees rebecca harms , co-leader of the green / european free alliance group in the european parliament .
turkey is currently undergoing rapid growth , and seeing a lot of investment .
" this makes it an ideal moment to address environmental issues , " says harms .
" but instead , they 're doing everything wrong .
ankara refuses to listen to criticism , and not only is the environment at stake when it comes to ambitious construction projects , cultural heritage is also at risk . "
when turkey first began negotiating eu membership , the government was far more open to criticism .
but with the accession process continuing at a relatively slow pace , ankara does n't appear to be feeling any heat .
" for as long as the eu remains a distant prospect , the issue is on the backburner , " says harms .
but she herself is undeterred , and is pinning her hopes on local environmental activists .
she plans to visit turkey in 2011 to meet them . in another hopeful sign , she 'll also be talking to egemen bagis , turkish minister for eu affairs . " he 's agreed to meet us , " she says .

he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie zu guttenberg wanted to meet with female soldiers in particular stephanie zu guttenberg , 34 , first visited a field hospital and later met with women soldiers .
her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : the guttenbergs are often called the ' german kennedys ' for their youth and charm popular support waning the military mission in afghanistan appears to have little public support within germany , with the majority of people being in favor of a quick withdrawal . in a recent poll conducted for zdf , 70 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of a quick pullout .
currently there are around 5,000 bundeswehr personnel stationed in afghanistan , which makes it the third strongest isaf contingent after the united states and britain .
guttenberg is travelling with a large delegation that also includes two german state premiers and a talk show host , who is to record the latest edition of his television program in afghanistan , with guttenberg and several soldiers as guests .

turkey is currently undergoing rapid growth , and seeing a lot of investment .

" but instead , they 're doing everything wrong .
ankara refuses to listen to criticism , and not only is the environment at stake when it comes to ambitious construction projects , cultural heritage is also at risk . "
when turkey first began negotiating eu membership , the government was far more open to criticism .
but with the accession process continuing at a relatively slow pace , ankara does n't appear to be feeling any heat .
" for as long as the eu remains a distant prospect , the issue is on the backburner , " says harms .
but she herself is undeterred , and is pinning her hopes on local environmental activists .
she plans to visit turkey in 2011 to meet them . in another hopeful sign , she 'll also be talking to egemen bagis , turkish minister for eu affairs . " he 's agreed to meet us , " she says .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie zu guttenberg wanted to meet with female soldiers in particular stephanie zu guttenberg , 34 , first visited a field hospital and later met with women soldiers .
her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .

but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit . even though german chancellor angela merkel has tried hard to squelch talk about issuing common european bonds , the idea is far from dead and is expected to generate plenty of debate at the next european union finance ministers ' summit , which begins on thursday .
" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 14.12.2010 eurobond proposals wo n't go away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurobonds would require nations to pool their borrowing chancellor merkel has dismissed calls for the eurozone to pool sovereign debt due to the high costs it would impose on germany .
but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit . even though german chancellor angela merkel has tried hard to squelch talk about issuing common european bonds , the idea is far from dead and is expected to generate plenty of debate at the next european union finance ministers ' summit , which begins on thursday .
" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

every year , people in europe spend billions at this time of year .
for many manufacturers and retailers , it 's the best month of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : kathrin m. · country : mexico christmas time is ment to be a " stop " in this stressful world .
even if it is seasoned with presents and decoration items , those must not be expensive .
one could very well step down a bit and not be carried by the race of " the expensier , the better " .
it could be just a nice " detail " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : ganesh k. · country : india in these hardtimes , overspending during christmas is not expected from germans who are doing well compared to their recession hit neighbours .

having lived in germany for the past three years i found the spirit of the christmas markets and the stores to be a great opportunity for people to mix with each other and also to support both large and small businesses .
i think this contrasts with the united states where christmas has become too commercial and we do not even wish each other merry christmas , but rather happy holidays .
christmas is after all the reason for the season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : daniel brian a. · country : uganda it is very paramount that europe and the rest of the world love to cherish life alongside businesses in december .

this is reflected in the current economic data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ifo-index , says jochen möbert of deutsche bank economic research , has increased another time .
german economics are booming . even the logistic sector , not benefitting of the recovery before , is now catching up due to the high export demand and the investments worldwide . but möbert warns : a lot of european politicians are not aware of the problems in the euro zone and the uncertain future of the common currency .
there is no effective cooperation .
europe needs a bigger solution for the whole euro area , möbert claims . get the answers ! see our interview with deutsche bank research expert jochen möbert .

in the case of greece , it was mainly a persistently unsound fiscal policy that led to a loss of confidence among investors , while in ireland this was primarily due to a credit bubble which had inflated the size of the financial sector . " bail-out for german municipalities " in three federal states saxony-anhalt , lower saxony and rhine-land-palatinate bail-out programmes for municipalities have already been set up in the course of 2010 .
in other federal states including north rhine-westphalia and hesse as well as to some extent in schleswig-holstein and saarland they are being discussed or similar measures are in the offing . education opportunities may be key to attracting bright minds to germany the fact that germany needs qualified immigration is not at issue among experts .
however , critics are right in pointing out that qualified foreigners show limited interest in working in germany .
it would thus be more promising to attract bright young people to germany by offering them a good education . innovative capacity in the aftermath of the crisis companies in germany kept their r & d spending at least constant even in the crisis year 2009 .
this is a good foundation for ensuring they remain competitive in future .
one explanation for what is a very robust reaction from a historical perspective is that particularly technologically advanced companies can ’ t afford not to invest in r & d precisely on account of the stiff competition .
investment in innovative start-ups and patent filings have , by contrast , been hit harder by the financial and economic crisis .
this shows that companies ’ top priority is to safeguard their current research cycles but they are less inclined to develop completely new innovations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 14.12.2010 germans ' carbon footprints are shrinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from what they drive to how they heat their homes , germans are cutting household co2 emissions germany 's transition to renewable energy sources has helped it reduce household carbon dioxide output over the last decade .
co2 tied to individual consumption accounts for much of countries ' overall emissions . per capita carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions in germany dropped between 2008 and 2009 according to the latest figures , released by the federal statistics office on monday .
direct and indirect co2 emissions from private households in germany last year totaled 618 million tons - or an average of 7.5 tons per person .
though the 0.1 ton decrease over last year 's figure constitutes a small reduction , individual emissions have dropped by about 5 percent since 2000 .
" the decrease is certainly viewed as positive , " helmut mayer , an analyst with the federal statistics office , told deutsche welle in an email .
mayer said german households had already cut their energy consumption considerably .
home heating and the use of petrol for cars are forms of " direct " emissions , which totaled some 216 million tons for 2009 .
overall , direct co2 output by german households sank by nearly 7 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
as to whether that trend would continue , mayer pointed to germany 's focus on clean power sources : " domestically , the expansion of renewable energies will lead to net savings , " mayer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indirect emissions are associated with the production of consumer products not just a drop in the bucket germany 's latest figures on household emissions come on the heels of united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , which ended with a compromise agreement early saturday morning .
co2 output due to household consumption is an important part of countries ' total greenhouse gas output – a statistic calculated based on countries ' overall emissions levels .
individuals and households are responsible for 72 percent of greenhouse gas emissions , according to edgar hertwich , professor of industrial ecology at the norwegian university of science and technology .
hertwich , who was involved in the prestigious " carbon footprint of nations " research project that analyzed global co2 emissions , told deutsche welle that public consumption and investments in resources like roads and new buildings accounted for the remainder of the emissions total .
while he praised germany 's federal statistics office for taking on the topic of individual emissions , he said the reductions noted in germany were " surprising " .
" they actually contradict what we have seen from other countries in europe , " hertwich said , citing norway and the united kingdom as examples of countries whose carbon footprints are growing .
there , substantial increases in imports from toys to tv sets - especially goods produced in developing countries - has led to corresponding increases in individual emissions .
' indirect ' , consumption-related emissions measured in germany in 2009 included the output associated with the production of goods - both at home and abroad - used by german households .
this figure accounted for the bulk of germany 's total co2 output for individuals , with 402 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year .
" i would like to see the methods that were used to calculate those numbers , " hertwich added .
overall , carbon dioxide output associated with the production of consumer products dropped by 4.3 percent between 2000 and last year .
bildunterschrift : expansion of renewable energy sources has helped germany cut emissions the trends behind the trend changing consumer habits were largely responsible for the reported reductions , despite the fact that household consumption has increased overall .
germans were reportedly buying fewer tangible products and more services , which typically have a reduced carbon footprint compared to manufactured goods .
the german federal statistics office report credited more consumers switching to cars with diesel engines for part of the drop in direct emissions , while the move to natural gas from oil fuel helped slash heating-related co2 output .
but germany 's transition to carbon-neutral and other environmentally friendly sources of power has also played a major role .
about half of all co2 emissions related to the production of consumer goods are linked to energy generation .
the report said the country had increased its share of power won from renewable sources by nearly 10 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
hertwich praised germany as " one of the pioneers in renewable energy production , " but said achieving global emissions reductions targets would require " a substantial decrease " in greenhouse gas output - which could only be achieved with a carbon-free electricity sector and smart transportation solutions .
german environment minister norbert roettgen has called on europe to lead the way on that front , saying reductions are key to fulfilling the international community 's efforts to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius by 2020 .
" europe will only maintain its leading role in climate protection if we resolve to move forward and reduce our emissions by 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020 , " he told the german daily rheinische post in an interview published on monday .

but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say volunteers working with children should also have criminal checks .
risk of endangering vulnerable children heinz hilgers of the german association for child protection warns that there are situations where visiting a family can be counterproductive .
" if you make a house visit on the basis of a phone call from a neighbor , who might have ulterior motives , it could damage the relationship with the existing social worker , " he told deutsche welle .
" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .
i would have liked the federal government to have invested more , " hilgers told deutsche welle .
if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 14.12.2010 new child protection law aims to strengthen families rather than divide them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social workers would have to visit the homes of children at risk the government has decided that the best way to help children at risk of abuse is to intervene early on .
but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say volunteers working with children should also have criminal checks .
risk of endangering vulnerable children heinz hilgers of the german association for child protection warns that there are situations where visiting a family can be counterproductive .
" if you make a house visit on the basis of a phone call from a neighbor , who might have ulterior motives , it could damage the relationship with the existing social worker , " he told deutsche welle .
" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .
i would have liked the federal government to have invested more , " hilgers told deutsche welle .
if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

some progress has been made , but many say it 's not enough . according to the european commission , the most pressing environmental concerns in turkey include water quality and radiation protection .
but in the area of nature conservation too , change has been slow to come .
moreover , recent amendments to mining laws as well as new rules regarding visas designed to boost tourism are seen as potentially highly damaging to the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air and water pollution are serious problems in istanbul guelcan nitsch , the founder of yeşil çember , the turkish branch of friends of the earth says she 's worried .
in november 2010 , she accompanied the organization 's german delegation to istanbul to talk to representatives from various turkish environmental groups . " in turkey , environmental protection is still in its infancy , " she said .
" the work we 're doing there is a bit like development aid . " organizations such as tema , bugay and greenpeace turkey have much to contend with .
for now , the government is reluctant to cooperate with them , explains nitsch , and environmental protection appears to exist only on paper .
even though she concedes that legislation exists , she stresses that its actual implementation is not sufficiently supervised . " you even see construction companies granted permission to build in conservation areas , " she despairs . anger over akkuyu ankara has other priorities , it seems .
it recently signed a contract with russia to build a nuclear power plant in akkuyu on the mediterranean coast .
scheduled for completion in 2017 , the project is expected to cost an estimated $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.8 billion euros -rrb- , and will consist of four nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 4,800-megawatts . environmental activists are up in arms , not least because akkuyu is located in an earthquake - prone region .
locals have also launched protests , and many are planning to move away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment is not yet a mainstream issue in turkey they are n't the only environmental refugees in turkey , says nitsch .
other major development ventures which have resulted in population displacement include the southeast anatolia project -lrb- gap -rrb- , which foresees 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants built in the basins of the euphrates and tigris .
the centerpiece of the project is the atatürk dam , which was completed in 1990 and is still one of the world 's largest dams . the goal of gap is to improve irrigation , hydraulic energy production , agriculture and urban and rural infrastructure .
the project is billed as a multi-sector integrated regional development initiative , based on the concept of sustainable development for the nine million people who live in the region . dawning awareness but elsewhere in the country , there 's little trace of sustainable development .
valuable carbon sinks , peat bogs and lakes in anatolia are being degraded.this not only threatens the habitat of numerous species of flora and fauna , but has far-reaching economic and social consequences for the local population . at least the problem has been recognized : at lake yenicaga and lake akgol , experts have begun studying the condition of the wetlands and are using their findings to introduce schemes that show locals how to manage the wetlands in a way that conserves their ecological functions and partially rehabilitates them . guelcan nitsch from friends of the earth believes that the population in turkey is beginning to grasp the importance of environmental protection , and hopes that it wo n't be long before it tops political agendas . before that happens , the issues needs to go mainstream .
" we want environmental groups to have more of a voice , " she says .
" but this will take some time . " the eu 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if wetlands dry up , large amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the air she says that the support of european politicians is crucial to this process .
they need to ramp up pressure on the turkish government and demand greater commitment to the environmental cause .
" europe has not been sufficiently confrontational , " agrees rebecca harms , co-leader of the green / european free alliance group in the european parliament .
turkey is currently undergoing rapid growth , and seeing a lot of investment .
" this makes it an ideal moment to address environmental issues , " says harms .
" but instead , they 're doing everything wrong .
ankara refuses to listen to criticism , and not only is the environment at stake when it comes to ambitious construction projects , cultural heritage is also at risk . "
when turkey first began negotiating eu membership , the government was far more open to criticism .
but with the accession process continuing at a relatively slow pace , ankara does n't appear to be feeling any heat .
" for as long as the eu remains a distant prospect , the issue is on the backburner , " says harms .
but she herself is undeterred , and is pinning her hopes on local environmental activists .
she plans to visit turkey in 2011 to meet them . in another hopeful sign , she 'll also be talking to egemen bagis , turkish minister for eu affairs . " he 's agreed to meet us , " she says .

he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit . even though german chancellor angela merkel has tried hard to squelch talk about issuing common european bonds , the idea is far from dead and is expected to generate plenty of debate at the next european union finance ministers ' summit , which begins on thursday .
" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

some progress has been made , but many say it 's not enough . according to the european commission , the most pressing environmental concerns in turkey include water quality and radiation protection .
but in the area of nature conservation too , change has been slow to come .
moreover , recent amendments to mining laws as well as new rules regarding visas designed to boost tourism are seen as potentially highly damaging to the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air and water pollution are serious problems in istanbul guelcan nitsch , the founder of yeşil çember , the turkish branch of friends of the earth says she 's worried .
in november 2010 , she accompanied the organization 's german delegation to istanbul to talk to representatives from various turkish environmental groups . " in turkey , environmental protection is still in its infancy , " she said .
" the work we 're doing there is a bit like development aid . " organizations such as tema , bugay and greenpeace turkey have much to contend with .
for now , the government is reluctant to cooperate with them , explains nitsch , and environmental protection appears to exist only on paper .
even though she concedes that legislation exists , she stresses that its actual implementation is not sufficiently supervised . " you even see construction companies granted permission to build in conservation areas , " she despairs . anger over akkuyu ankara has other priorities , it seems .
it recently signed a contract with russia to build a nuclear power plant in akkuyu on the mediterranean coast .
scheduled for completion in 2017 , the project is expected to cost an estimated $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.8 billion euros -rrb- , and will consist of four nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 4,800-megawatts . environmental activists are up in arms , not least because akkuyu is located in an earthquake - prone region .
locals have also launched protests , and many are planning to move away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment is not yet a mainstream issue in turkey they are n't the only environmental refugees in turkey , says nitsch .
other major development ventures which have resulted in population displacement include the southeast anatolia project -lrb- gap -rrb- , which foresees 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants built in the basins of the euphrates and tigris .
the centerpiece of the project is the atatürk dam , which was completed in 1990 and is still one of the world 's largest dams . the goal of gap is to improve irrigation , hydraulic energy production , agriculture and urban and rural infrastructure .
the project is billed as a multi-sector integrated regional development initiative , based on the concept of sustainable development for the nine million people who live in the region . dawning awareness but elsewhere in the country , there 's little trace of sustainable development .
valuable carbon sinks , peat bogs and lakes in anatolia are being degraded.this not only threatens the habitat of numerous species of flora and fauna , but has far-reaching economic and social consequences for the local population . at least the problem has been recognized : at lake yenicaga and lake akgol , experts have begun studying the condition of the wetlands and are using their findings to introduce schemes that show locals how to manage the wetlands in a way that conserves their ecological functions and partially rehabilitates them . guelcan nitsch from friends of the earth believes that the population in turkey is beginning to grasp the importance of environmental protection , and hopes that it wo n't be long before it tops political agendas . before that happens , the issues needs to go mainstream .
" we want environmental groups to have more of a voice , " she says .
" but this will take some time . " the eu 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if wetlands dry up , large amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the air she says that the support of european politicians is crucial to this process .
they need to ramp up pressure on the turkish government and demand greater commitment to the environmental cause .
" europe has not been sufficiently confrontational , " agrees rebecca harms , co-leader of the green / european free alliance group in the european parliament .
turkey is currently undergoing rapid growth , and seeing a lot of investment .
" this makes it an ideal moment to address environmental issues , " says harms .
" but instead , they 're doing everything wrong .
ankara refuses to listen to criticism , and not only is the environment at stake when it comes to ambitious construction projects , cultural heritage is also at risk . "
when turkey first began negotiating eu membership , the government was far more open to criticism .
but with the accession process continuing at a relatively slow pace , ankara does n't appear to be feeling any heat .
" for as long as the eu remains a distant prospect , the issue is on the backburner , " says harms .
but she herself is undeterred , and is pinning her hopes on local environmental activists .
she plans to visit turkey in 2011 to meet them . in another hopeful sign , she 'll also be talking to egemen bagis , turkish minister for eu affairs . " he 's agreed to meet us , " she says .

but the project faces several obstacles . experts say the official agreement between turkmenistan , afghanistan , pakistan and india to construct a 1700 kilometer-long gas pipeline is a milestone .
however , the implementation of this project is going to be a herculean task .
the proposed pipeline , ashgabat 's long-cherished dream , aims to transport 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually from turkmenistan .
passing through afghanistan and pakistan , it will end in india .
afghanistan is supposed to benefit the most from this transnational pipeline , since it will receive a lucrative amount of transit fees .
besides , pakistan 's energy crisis is deepening day by day , and islamabad has been looking for various options to secure its energy needs .
security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban pose a serious threat to the proposed project construction of the pipeline is set to start in 2012 , and the four countries hope to complete it by the end of 2014 .
experts are of the view that this timeline is far from realistic , as there are serious concerns about security in afghanistan and pakistan .
the proposed pipeline will pass through the taliban strongholds in southern afghanistan - helmand and kandahar - and then through pakistan 's baluchistan province , which is also facing an endemic separatist insurgency .
the afghan government has promised to deploy up to 7,000 troops to secure the pipeline .
michael kugelman , an expert on the region at the wilson center in washington , told deutsche welle that the project was very promising for regional stability and energy security , as india and pakistan were increasingly depending on foreign energy resources .
however , he was skeptical whether the project could really take off .
" the initial question is : can this pipeline exist without getting blown up ? " said kugelman . " and that is not the only issue .
you are dealing with the partnership of two long-time enemies - india and pakistan , and you are dealing with one of the world 's most anti-democratic regimes in turkmenistan .
and another problem , particularly in the afghanistan context , is that with this new revenue source , and with a need to ensure the security along the pipeline route , it could really exacerbate corruption . "
tapi vs. ipi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian and pakistani presidents shake hands during a summit in tehran pakistan has already signed a similar agreement with iran .
the iran-pakistan-india -lrb- ipi -rrb- gas pipeline has been severely opposed by the us , which favors the turkmenistan pipeline .
islamabad is not ready to abandon the ipi and cites its severe energy crisis as a legitimate reason to undertake multiple energy projects .
india also says it has not shelved the ipi project although it is concerned about the security in pakistan .
" iran and the us do not have the best of relations .
the us , therefore , pressures both india and pakistan not to sign the iran-pakistan-india pipeline , " pakistani defense analyst ayesha siddiqua told deutsche welle .
she emphasized that the existing agreements are basically mous -lrb- memorandums of understanding -rrb- , and it is yet to be seen which project would eventually become a reality .
according to michael kugelman , washington does not like strengthening iran , however , pakistan 's and india 's energy needs are immense .
" i can imagine that the us is not pleased , but it is important to be realistic .
pakistan and india are both very energy insecure countries .
these countries are going to need to do what is in their best interest , and if it involves working with countries like iran , then so be it . "
still worth pursuing despite many controversies surrounding the project , tapi is believed to be beneficial for all the countries involved .
according to afghanistan 's minister of mines and industries , wahidullah shahrani , the gas pipeline will generate thousands of jobs in afghanistan .
he hopes that the economic benefit of the project will be such that the local people will themselves protect the pipeline .
" the entire region has a great need for energy resources .
whether it comes from iran or turkmenistan is not important , " said ayesha siddiqua .

it is now available for download , months after the game 's planned release sparked outrage among victims ' groups . the developer of a " first-person shooter " -style computer game , which lets participants take on the role of an east german border guard or escapee along the former east-west border , defended his project ahead of its release last friday evening , calling the game a way for younger generations to learn about germany 's history during the cold war .
the 24-year-old media arts student behind the controversial computer download , jens stober , said critics had never even seen the game , which was held back from its planned launch on germany 's anniversary of reunification , october 3 , following heated criticism .
" it has to be released today so that finally , everyone can form an opinion of it , " stober told a crowd of 100 gathered at the karlsruhe university of arts and design , ahead of the project 's premiere .
the game " 1378 km " - a reference to the total length of the boundary dividing east and west germany - triggered protests from victims ' advocacy groups in recent months , who argued that it was insensitive to those who had lived under east germany 's oppressive communist regime .
up to 16 gamers can play " 1378 km " at a time , and the game allows them to choose to be a border officer or an escapee in the year 1976 .
east german guards who catch a player trying to flee have three options : imprison him , escape with him , or shoot him .
but stober , who even received a death threat for creating the game , said it turned the " shoot- ' em-up " concept on its head , since points are deducted when players take aim at escapees .
" you shoot , you lose , " the game 's creator said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that it is a shooter game , the creator of ' 1378 km ' said : " you shoot , you lose . "
ongoing opposition stober 's game was still generating controversy ahead of its official launch last friday night , with the head of the uokg , a berlin-based umbrella group for victims of the communist dictatorship , calling on the university in karlsruhe not to release the game .
the uokg 's rainer wagner called for changes to be made and to " talk with the victims . "
referencing his own attempts to flee the inner-german border , which twice landed him behind bars , wagner said " 1378 km " would only serve to traumatize victims once more .
more than 100,000 east germans attempted to flee east germany between 1961 , when the border was built , and the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
according to the center for contemporary history in potsdam , 136 people were killed trying to flee along the berlin wall alone , with estimates ranging from 270 to 780 people dead along the entire border .
" do n't put the game on the internet , and do n't allow for the shooting of escapees , " wagner said . stober has said he would make changes to the game in the coming weeks but that he has no plans to remove the border soldiers component , calling it the " foundation of the game . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historians estimate hundreds of east germans died while trying to cross into west germany academic support meanwhile , the university 's vice rector uwe hochmuth said the school was prepared to engage in a dialogue with victims ' groups but that the process was dependent on the game 's release , which would allow people to form an opinion on the project .
members of the school 's faculty defended the game against moral and ethical challenges at friday 's meeting , making a case for artistic freedom .
" this work is an art project , and art has always tried to overstep boundaries , " the university 's head of media arts , michael bielicky said .
but another person attending the discussion ahead of the game 's launch claimed " 1378 km " had nothing to do with art - and moreover , that the game failed to address the gravity of the topic : " i crossed the border , and i 'm telling you that this game is nonsense .
this was a very defining experience for me , and i 'm disappointed that a game has been made out of it . " on more than one occasion , stober has made assurances that he is well-aware of the serious nature of his game 's subject matter .
he said he envisioned the game as an interactive way for his generation to experience the country 's cold war past .
stober reportedly spent a full year conducting research for the project . earlier on saturday , the game 's website reported that stress on the server had prevented users from downloading the game but said the problem had been resolved by the afternoon . author : amanda price -lrb- dpa , epd -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the silicon valley titan dismisses the 100-page opinion . on tuesday , the french autorité de la concurrence -lrb- competition authority -rrb- declared that " google holds a dominant position on the advertising market linked to search engines . "
in a 100-page opinion posted to its website , the authority noted that french competition law " can apply limits to google 's actions and provide a response to the competitive stakes brought to light by the actors , without the need to implement sector-wide regulations . "
this declaration comes less than a month after the european commission began its antitrust investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
the document outlines three main sources of complaint against google , which include competing search engines , website editors , and the press .
in addition to calling for google to be more transparent in advertising , the authority raised the possibility of an online expansion of the " sapin law , " a 1993 french law that creates more transparency in advertising rates , which forces comapnies to reconcile the published prices for advertising time and space with the actual price charged .
google rejects french regulatory opinion in addition , the french government entity wants french media outlets to be able to " request and obtain exclusion from google news , but without necessarily being delisted by the google search engine . "
in a statement emailed tuesday to deutsche welle , the company called the french analysis " too narrow . "
" search ads are one of many options for advertisers , " google said .
" if the price of search ads rises , advertisers can and do switch to other formats , both online and offline .
that 's the sign of a competitive and dynamic industry . "

but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 14.12.2010 germans ' carbon footprints are shrinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from what they drive to how they heat their homes , germans are cutting household co2 emissions germany 's transition to renewable energy sources has helped it reduce household carbon dioxide output over the last decade .
co2 tied to individual consumption accounts for much of countries ' overall emissions . per capita carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions in germany dropped between 2008 and 2009 according to the latest figures , released by the federal statistics office on monday .
direct and indirect co2 emissions from private households in germany last year totaled 618 million tons - or an average of 7.5 tons per person .
though the 0.1 ton decrease over last year 's figure constitutes a small reduction , individual emissions have dropped by about 5 percent since 2000 .
" the decrease is certainly viewed as positive , " helmut mayer , an analyst with the federal statistics office , told deutsche welle in an email .
mayer said german households had already cut their energy consumption considerably .
home heating and the use of petrol for cars are forms of " direct " emissions , which totaled some 216 million tons for 2009 .
overall , direct co2 output by german households sank by nearly 7 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
as to whether that trend would continue , mayer pointed to germany 's focus on clean power sources : " domestically , the expansion of renewable energies will lead to net savings , " mayer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indirect emissions are associated with the production of consumer products not just a drop in the bucket germany 's latest figures on household emissions come on the heels of united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , which ended with a compromise agreement early saturday morning .
co2 output due to household consumption is an important part of countries ' total greenhouse gas output – a statistic calculated based on countries ' overall emissions levels .
individuals and households are responsible for 72 percent of greenhouse gas emissions , according to edgar hertwich , professor of industrial ecology at the norwegian university of science and technology .
hertwich , who was involved in the prestigious " carbon footprint of nations " research project that analyzed global co2 emissions , told deutsche welle that public consumption and investments in resources like roads and new buildings accounted for the remainder of the emissions total .
while he praised germany 's federal statistics office for taking on the topic of individual emissions , he said the reductions noted in germany were " surprising " .
" they actually contradict what we have seen from other countries in europe , " hertwich said , citing norway and the united kingdom as examples of countries whose carbon footprints are growing .
there , substantial increases in imports from toys to tv sets - especially goods produced in developing countries - has led to corresponding increases in individual emissions .
' indirect ' , consumption-related emissions measured in germany in 2009 included the output associated with the production of goods - both at home and abroad - used by german households .
this figure accounted for the bulk of germany 's total co2 output for individuals , with 402 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year .
" i would like to see the methods that were used to calculate those numbers , " hertwich added .
overall , carbon dioxide output associated with the production of consumer products dropped by 4.3 percent between 2000 and last year .
bildunterschrift : expansion of renewable energy sources has helped germany cut emissions the trends behind the trend changing consumer habits were largely responsible for the reported reductions , despite the fact that household consumption has increased overall .
germans were reportedly buying fewer tangible products and more services , which typically have a reduced carbon footprint compared to manufactured goods .
the german federal statistics office report credited more consumers switching to cars with diesel engines for part of the drop in direct emissions , while the move to natural gas from oil fuel helped slash heating-related co2 output .
but germany 's transition to carbon-neutral and other environmentally friendly sources of power has also played a major role .
about half of all co2 emissions related to the production of consumer goods are linked to energy generation .
the report said the country had increased its share of power won from renewable sources by nearly 10 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
hertwich praised germany as " one of the pioneers in renewable energy production , " but said achieving global emissions reductions targets would require " a substantial decrease " in greenhouse gas output - which could only be achieved with a carbon-free electricity sector and smart transportation solutions .
german environment minister norbert roettgen has called on europe to lead the way on that front , saying reductions are key to fulfilling the international community 's efforts to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius by 2020 .
" europe will only maintain its leading role in climate protection if we resolve to move forward and reduce our emissions by 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020 , " he told the german daily rheinische post in an interview published on monday .

but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say volunteers working with children should also have criminal checks .
risk of endangering vulnerable children heinz hilgers of the german association for child protection warns that there are situations where visiting a family can be counterproductive .
" if you make a house visit on the basis of a phone call from a neighbor , who might have ulterior motives , it could damage the relationship with the existing social worker , " he told deutsche welle .
" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .
i would have liked the federal government to have invested more , " hilgers told deutsche welle .
if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .
i would have liked the federal government to have invested more , " hilgers told deutsche welle .
if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

this is reflected in the current economic data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ifo-index , says jochen möbert of deutsche bank economic research , has increased another time .
german economics are booming . even the logistic sector , not benefitting of the recovery before , is now catching up due to the high export demand and the investments worldwide . but möbert warns : a lot of european politicians are not aware of the problems in the euro zone and the uncertain future of the common currency .
there is no effective cooperation .
europe needs a bigger solution for the whole euro area , möbert claims . get the answers ! see our interview with deutsche bank research expert jochen möbert .
click on " report as video on demand " at the bottom of the page ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : read the latest and most interesting db research publications here . this month : the euro debt crisis – similarities and differences the reasons for the current problems of some euro-area sovereigns on the capital markets differ from country to country .
in the case of greece , it was mainly a persistently unsound fiscal policy that led to a loss of confidence among investors , while in ireland this was primarily due to a credit bubble which had inflated the size of the financial sector . " bail-out for german municipalities " in three federal states saxony-anhalt , lower saxony and rhine-land-palatinate bail-out programmes for municipalities have already been set up in the course of 2010 .
in other federal states including north rhine-westphalia and hesse as well as to some extent in schleswig-holstein and saarland they are being discussed or similar measures are in the offing . education opportunities may be key to attracting bright minds to germany the fact that germany needs qualified immigration is not at issue among experts .
however , critics are right in pointing out that qualified foreigners show limited interest in working in germany .
it would thus be more promising to attract bright young people to germany by offering them a good education . innovative capacity in the aftermath of the crisis companies in germany kept their r & d spending at least constant even in the crisis year 2009 .
this is a good foundation for ensuring they remain competitive in future .
one explanation for what is a very robust reaction from a historical perspective is that particularly technologically advanced companies can ’ t afford not to invest in r & d precisely on account of the stiff competition .
investment in innovative start-ups and patent filings have , by contrast , been hit harder by the financial and economic crisis .
this shows that companies ’ top priority is to safeguard their current research cycles but they are less inclined to develop completely new innovations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie zu guttenberg wanted to meet with female soldiers in particular stephanie zu guttenberg , 34 , first visited a field hospital and later met with women soldiers .
her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : the guttenbergs are often called the ' german kennedys ' for their youth and charm popular support waning the military mission in afghanistan appears to have little public support within germany , with the majority of people being in favor of a quick withdrawal . in a recent poll conducted for zdf , 70 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of a quick pullout .
currently there are around 5,000 bundeswehr personnel stationed in afghanistan , which makes it the third strongest isaf contingent after the united states and britain .
guttenberg is travelling with a large delegation that also includes two german state premiers and a talk show host , who is to record the latest edition of his television program in afghanistan , with guttenberg and several soldiers as guests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.12.2010 tactics and discipline are the keys to dortmund ’ s superlative season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been no end to the celebrations for dortmund saturday ’ s win over bremen kept dortmund on course to become the bundesliga ’ s most dominant team ever .
but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie zu guttenberg wanted to meet with female soldiers in particular stephanie zu guttenberg , 34 , first visited a field hospital and later met with women soldiers .
her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : the guttenbergs are often called the ' german kennedys ' for their youth and charm popular support waning the military mission in afghanistan appears to have little public support within germany , with the majority of people being in favor of a quick withdrawal . in a recent poll conducted for zdf , 70 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of a quick pullout .
currently there are around 5,000 bundeswehr personnel stationed in afghanistan , which makes it the third strongest isaf contingent after the united states and britain .
guttenberg is travelling with a large delegation that also includes two german state premiers and a talk show host , who is to record the latest edition of his television program in afghanistan , with guttenberg and several soldiers as guests .

judge howard riddle granted assange release on a 200,000-pound -lrb- 236,000 euros , $ 315,000 -rrb- bail ahead of another hearing on jan .
11 , but his release was delayed as prosecutors representing sweden said they would appeal the decision .
riddle ordered assange to remain in custody until a new hearing is held within 48 hours .
several of assange 's supporters have offered to pay his bail for him .
he would have to wear an electronic tag to monitor his location as part of the conditions of his release .
earlier in the day assange relayed a message through his mother christine , who reportedly traveled from her native australia to be with her son , saying his " convictions are unfaltering " and that he remains " true to the ideals " he has expressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange gave himself up to police on december 7 " these circumstances shall not shake them , " he said .
" if anything , this process has increased my determination that they are true and correct . "
assange has said the sex charges in sweden are fabrications designed to silence him and his organization , and that they stem from a dispute over " consensual but unprotected sex . "
visa , mastercard and paypal criticized in the statement , assange also criticized major finance companies visa , mastercard and paypal for suspending payments to his wikileaks site , claiming they were under us control as " instruments of foreign policy . "
he called on the world " to protect my work and my people from these illegal and immoral acts . "
last week internet activists managed to shut down the visa and mastercard sites as well as that of the swedish government in protest to their perceived obstruction of wikileaks 's operations .

assange and his lawyers have voiced fears that us prosecutors may intend to indict him for espionage after the wikileaks website published the documents .
even if he is cleared of the sexual assault charges , he may soon be in the dock facing a completely different set of accusations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.12.2010 tactics and discipline are the keys to dortmund ’ s superlative season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been no end to the celebrations for dortmund saturday ’ s win over bremen kept dortmund on course to become the bundesliga ’ s most dominant team ever .
but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

judge howard riddle granted assange release on a 200,000-pound -lrb- 236,000 euros , $ 315,000 -rrb- bail ahead of another hearing on jan .
11 , but his release was delayed as prosecutors representing sweden said they would appeal the decision .
riddle ordered assange to remain in custody until a new hearing is held within 48 hours .
several of assange 's supporters have offered to pay his bail for him .
he would have to wear an electronic tag to monitor his location as part of the conditions of his release .
earlier in the day assange relayed a message through his mother christine , who reportedly traveled from her native australia to be with her son , saying his " convictions are unfaltering " and that he remains " true to the ideals " he has expressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange gave himself up to police on december 7 " these circumstances shall not shake them , " he said .
" if anything , this process has increased my determination that they are true and correct . "
assange has said the sex charges in sweden are fabrications designed to silence him and his organization , and that they stem from a dispute over " consensual but unprotected sex . "
visa , mastercard and paypal criticized in the statement , assange also criticized major finance companies visa , mastercard and paypal for suspending payments to his wikileaks site , claiming they were under us control as " instruments of foreign policy . "
he called on the world " to protect my work and my people from these illegal and immoral acts . "
last week internet activists managed to shut down the visa and mastercard sites as well as that of the swedish government in protest to their perceived obstruction of wikileaks 's operations .

assange and his lawyers have voiced fears that us prosecutors may intend to indict him for espionage after the wikileaks website published the documents .
even if he is cleared of the sexual assault charges , he may soon be in the dock facing a completely different set of accusations .

" if the military regime is not ready to enter into a dialogue with the minority groups , the ongoing fighting will spread to other parts of the country . " the military is dominated by myanmar 's ethnic majority , the burmans .
for decades , the military has been unable to control many border regions , where more than 100 ethnic minorities , comprising more than 30 percent of myanmar 's population , are concentrated . precarious security situation in the past , the junta tacitly accepted the fact that different rebel armies controlled these territories .
the junta also struck ceasefire deals with them .
but recently , the regime has sought to expand its control by integrating the rebel groups into the military-run border guard force . this has triggered widespread anger among the minorities and led to a number of clashes with the army this year .

the proposed pipeline , ashgabat 's long-cherished dream , aims to transport 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually from turkmenistan .

the proposed pipeline will pass through the taliban strongholds in southern afghanistan - helmand and kandahar - and then through pakistan 's baluchistan province , which is also facing an endemic separatist insurgency .
the afghan government has promised to deploy up to 7,000 troops to secure the pipeline .
michael kugelman , an expert on the region at the wilson center in washington , told deutsche welle that the project was very promising for regional stability and energy security , as india and pakistan were increasingly depending on foreign energy resources .
however , he was skeptical whether the project could really take off .
" the initial question is : can this pipeline exist without getting blown up ? " said kugelman . " and that is not the only issue .
you are dealing with the partnership of two long-time enemies - india and pakistan , and you are dealing with one of the world 's most anti-democratic regimes in turkmenistan .

but the project faces several obstacles . experts say the official agreement between turkmenistan , afghanistan , pakistan and india to construct a 1700 kilometer-long gas pipeline is a milestone .
however , the implementation of this project is going to be a herculean task .
the proposed pipeline , ashgabat 's long-cherished dream , aims to transport 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually from turkmenistan .
passing through afghanistan and pakistan , it will end in india .
afghanistan is supposed to benefit the most from this transnational pipeline , since it will receive a lucrative amount of transit fees .
besides , pakistan 's energy crisis is deepening day by day , and islamabad has been looking for various options to secure its energy needs .
security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban pose a serious threat to the proposed project construction of the pipeline is set to start in 2012 , and the four countries hope to complete it by the end of 2014 .
experts are of the view that this timeline is far from realistic , as there are serious concerns about security in afghanistan and pakistan .
the proposed pipeline will pass through the taliban strongholds in southern afghanistan - helmand and kandahar - and then through pakistan 's baluchistan province , which is also facing an endemic separatist insurgency .
the afghan government has promised to deploy up to 7,000 troops to secure the pipeline .
michael kugelman , an expert on the region at the wilson center in washington , told deutsche welle that the project was very promising for regional stability and energy security , as india and pakistan were increasingly depending on foreign energy resources .
however , he was skeptical whether the project could really take off .
" the initial question is : can this pipeline exist without getting blown up ? " said kugelman . " and that is not the only issue .
you are dealing with the partnership of two long-time enemies - india and pakistan , and you are dealing with one of the world 's most anti-democratic regimes in turkmenistan .
and another problem , particularly in the afghanistan context , is that with this new revenue source , and with a need to ensure the security along the pipeline route , it could really exacerbate corruption . "
tapi vs. ipi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian and pakistani presidents shake hands during a summit in tehran pakistan has already signed a similar agreement with iran .
the iran-pakistan-india -lrb- ipi -rrb- gas pipeline has been severely opposed by the us , which favors the turkmenistan pipeline .
islamabad is not ready to abandon the ipi and cites its severe energy crisis as a legitimate reason to undertake multiple energy projects .
india also says it has not shelved the ipi project although it is concerned about the security in pakistan .
" iran and the us do not have the best of relations .
the us , therefore , pressures both india and pakistan not to sign the iran-pakistan-india pipeline , " pakistani defense analyst ayesha siddiqua told deutsche welle .
she emphasized that the existing agreements are basically mous -lrb- memorandums of understanding -rrb- , and it is yet to be seen which project would eventually become a reality .
according to michael kugelman , washington does not like strengthening iran , however , pakistan 's and india 's energy needs are immense .
" i can imagine that the us is not pleased , but it is important to be realistic .
pakistan and india are both very energy insecure countries .
these countries are going to need to do what is in their best interest , and if it involves working with countries like iran , then so be it . "
still worth pursuing despite many controversies surrounding the project , tapi is believed to be beneficial for all the countries involved .
according to afghanistan 's minister of mines and industries , wahidullah shahrani , the gas pipeline will generate thousands of jobs in afghanistan .
he hopes that the economic benefit of the project will be such that the local people will themselves protect the pipeline .
" the entire region has a great need for energy resources .
whether it comes from iran or turkmenistan is not important , " said ayesha siddiqua .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 14.12.2010 controversial east german-themed computer game finally goes online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the game , players take on the role of east german border guards ' 1378 km ' gives players a glimpse of border guard life along germany 's cold war-era inner border .
it is now available for download , months after the game 's planned release sparked outrage among victims ' groups . the developer of a " first-person shooter " -style computer game , which lets participants take on the role of an east german border guard or escapee along the former east-west border , defended his project ahead of its release last friday evening , calling the game a way for younger generations to learn about germany 's history during the cold war .
the 24-year-old media arts student behind the controversial computer download , jens stober , said critics had never even seen the game , which was held back from its planned launch on germany 's anniversary of reunification , october 3 , following heated criticism .
" it has to be released today so that finally , everyone can form an opinion of it , " stober told a crowd of 100 gathered at the karlsruhe university of arts and design , ahead of the project 's premiere .
the game " 1378 km " - a reference to the total length of the boundary dividing east and west germany - triggered protests from victims ' advocacy groups in recent months , who argued that it was insensitive to those who had lived under east germany 's oppressive communist regime .
up to 16 gamers can play " 1378 km " at a time , and the game allows them to choose to be a border officer or an escapee in the year 1976 .
east german guards who catch a player trying to flee have three options : imprison him , escape with him , or shoot him .
but stober , who even received a death threat for creating the game , said it turned the " shoot- ' em-up " concept on its head , since points are deducted when players take aim at escapees .
" you shoot , you lose , " the game 's creator said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that it is a shooter game , the creator of ' 1378 km ' said : " you shoot , you lose . "
ongoing opposition stober 's game was still generating controversy ahead of its official launch last friday night , with the head of the uokg , a berlin-based umbrella group for victims of the communist dictatorship , calling on the university in karlsruhe not to release the game .
the uokg 's rainer wagner called for changes to be made and to " talk with the victims . "
referencing his own attempts to flee the inner-german border , which twice landed him behind bars , wagner said " 1378 km " would only serve to traumatize victims once more .
more than 100,000 east germans attempted to flee east germany between 1961 , when the border was built , and the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
according to the center for contemporary history in potsdam , 136 people were killed trying to flee along the berlin wall alone , with estimates ranging from 270 to 780 people dead along the entire border .
" do n't put the game on the internet , and do n't allow for the shooting of escapees , " wagner said . stober has said he would make changes to the game in the coming weeks but that he has no plans to remove the border soldiers component , calling it the " foundation of the game . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historians estimate hundreds of east germans died while trying to cross into west germany academic support meanwhile , the university 's vice rector uwe hochmuth said the school was prepared to engage in a dialogue with victims ' groups but that the process was dependent on the game 's release , which would allow people to form an opinion on the project .
members of the school 's faculty defended the game against moral and ethical challenges at friday 's meeting , making a case for artistic freedom .
" this work is an art project , and art has always tried to overstep boundaries , " the university 's head of media arts , michael bielicky said .
but another person attending the discussion ahead of the game 's launch claimed " 1378 km " had nothing to do with art - and moreover , that the game failed to address the gravity of the topic : " i crossed the border , and i 'm telling you that this game is nonsense .
this was a very defining experience for me , and i 'm disappointed that a game has been made out of it . " on more than one occasion , stober has made assurances that he is well-aware of the serious nature of his game 's subject matter .
he said he envisioned the game as an interactive way for his generation to experience the country 's cold war past .
stober reportedly spent a full year conducting research for the project . earlier on saturday , the game 's website reported that stress on the server had prevented users from downloading the game but said the problem had been resolved by the afternoon . author : amanda price -lrb- dpa , epd -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opposition politicians are calling the trip a pr stunt intended to lift their popularity . the green party is the latest to join a chorus of opposition criticism after german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg and his wife stephanie flew to afghanistan on monday on an unannounced troop visit .
the leader of the green parliamentary party , juergen trittin , said " a staged spectacle like this in one of the worst conflict zones of the world can barely be beaten for tastelessness . "
trittin said guttenberg had gone beyond the scope of his office with this " pr stunt . "
he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .

her joining the trip was intended as a gesture to show that the military mission had far more than just political backing , the defense ministry said in a statement .
the ministry also said she paid her own way .
in addition to the troop visitations , the guttenbergs recorded the segment for a tv talk show with a group of german soldiers for zdf . withdrawal to begin in 2012 guttenberg described the fighting in the country as " harder and longer than in previous winters , " but added that in recent months , some progress had been made . and he said it was important for him to get clear picture of the realities of the situation on the ground .
the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .
but there are signs that support for the military mission is on the decline .
opposition parties have threatened to withdraw their support in the bundestag unless the government agrees to move forward the start of a gradual pullout of german troops . the current plan is for the pullout of germany 's soldiers to begin in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : the guttenbergs are often called the ' german kennedys ' for their youth and charm popular support waning the military mission in afghanistan appears to have little public support within germany , with the majority of people being in favor of a quick withdrawal . in a recent poll conducted for zdf , 70 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of a quick pullout .

he said guttenberg should instead have explained to the german soldiers how long they still had to risk their lives " rather than using them as the backdrop for a personality show . "
he also criticized the minister ’ s television appearance on the public broadcaster zdf , scheduled to air on thursday night .
show of support guttenberg said the trip , his seventh to afghanistan and the first ever made by a german foreign minister and his wife , was meant as a show of support for the troops .
the couple visited german soldiers at the masar-i-scharif and kunduz bases .
" it 's very important that especially in the christmas season , we show the support and appreciation for those who are doing such a tough job , thousands of kilometers away from home , " he said .
guttenberg has himself received support from members of the coalition government .
csu politician hans-peter friedrich said that guttenberg had sent an " important signal . "
he described media reactions to the visit as " unfriendly , " saying that the soldiers had seen it very differently .
in particular , he noted the enthusiasm with which guttenberg ’ s wife was received by the soldiers .

the current mandate for german troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is set to expire in february 2011 , but the mission is expected to be extended by parliament .

some progress has been made , but many say it 's not enough . according to the european commission , the most pressing environmental concerns in turkey include water quality and radiation protection .
but in the area of nature conservation too , change has been slow to come .
moreover , recent amendments to mining laws as well as new rules regarding visas designed to boost tourism are seen as potentially highly damaging to the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air and water pollution are serious problems in istanbul guelcan nitsch , the founder of yeşil çember , the turkish branch of friends of the earth says she 's worried .
in november 2010 , she accompanied the organization 's german delegation to istanbul to talk to representatives from various turkish environmental groups . " in turkey , environmental protection is still in its infancy , " she said .
" the work we 're doing there is a bit like development aid . " organizations such as tema , bugay and greenpeace turkey have much to contend with .
for now , the government is reluctant to cooperate with them , explains nitsch , and environmental protection appears to exist only on paper .
even though she concedes that legislation exists , she stresses that its actual implementation is not sufficiently supervised . " you even see construction companies granted permission to build in conservation areas , " she despairs . anger over akkuyu ankara has other priorities , it seems .
it recently signed a contract with russia to build a nuclear power plant in akkuyu on the mediterranean coast .
scheduled for completion in 2017 , the project is expected to cost an estimated $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.8 billion euros -rrb- , and will consist of four nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 4,800-megawatts . environmental activists are up in arms , not least because akkuyu is located in an earthquake - prone region .
locals have also launched protests , and many are planning to move away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment is not yet a mainstream issue in turkey they are n't the only environmental refugees in turkey , says nitsch .
other major development ventures which have resulted in population displacement include the southeast anatolia project -lrb- gap -rrb- , which foresees 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants built in the basins of the euphrates and tigris .
the centerpiece of the project is the atatürk dam , which was completed in 1990 and is still one of the world 's largest dams . the goal of gap is to improve irrigation , hydraulic energy production , agriculture and urban and rural infrastructure .
the project is billed as a multi-sector integrated regional development initiative , based on the concept of sustainable development for the nine million people who live in the region . dawning awareness but elsewhere in the country , there 's little trace of sustainable development .
valuable carbon sinks , peat bogs and lakes in anatolia are being degraded.this not only threatens the habitat of numerous species of flora and fauna , but has far-reaching economic and social consequences for the local population . at least the problem has been recognized : at lake yenicaga and lake akgol , experts have begun studying the condition of the wetlands and are using their findings to introduce schemes that show locals how to manage the wetlands in a way that conserves their ecological functions and partially rehabilitates them . guelcan nitsch from friends of the earth believes that the population in turkey is beginning to grasp the importance of environmental protection , and hopes that it wo n't be long before it tops political agendas . before that happens , the issues needs to go mainstream .
" we want environmental groups to have more of a voice , " she says .
" but this will take some time . " the eu 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if wetlands dry up , large amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the air she says that the support of european politicians is crucial to this process .
they need to ramp up pressure on the turkish government and demand greater commitment to the environmental cause .
" europe has not been sufficiently confrontational , " agrees rebecca harms , co-leader of the green / european free alliance group in the european parliament .
turkey is currently undergoing rapid growth , and seeing a lot of investment .
" this makes it an ideal moment to address environmental issues , " says harms .
" but instead , they 're doing everything wrong .
ankara refuses to listen to criticism , and not only is the environment at stake when it comes to ambitious construction projects , cultural heritage is also at risk . "
when turkey first began negotiating eu membership , the government was far more open to criticism .
but with the accession process continuing at a relatively slow pace , ankara does n't appear to be feeling any heat .
" for as long as the eu remains a distant prospect , the issue is on the backburner , " says harms .
but she herself is undeterred , and is pinning her hopes on local environmental activists .
she plans to visit turkey in 2011 to meet them . in another hopeful sign , she 'll also be talking to egemen bagis , turkish minister for eu affairs . " he 's agreed to meet us , " she says .

but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

but their coach says the squad isn ’ t that gifted .
so why , then , are dortmund so darned good ? a win against frankfurt this saturday is all borussia dortmund , who are currently on 43 points , need to break the record , set by bayern munich in 2005 , for the most successful first half of a season .
moreover , the overall season record of 79 points , achieved twice by bayern between 1971 and 1973 , appears well within dortmund 's reach .
extrapolated over the whole season , dortmund 's current form would have them earning a sensational 90 points and make a case for this being the greatest bundesliga team of all time .
yet surprisingly , their coach does n't seem to think they are all that good .
“ we 're not naturally more gifted than other teams , ” juergen klopp said in a bundesliga interview before the bremen match .
“ we have to make up for it by working harder . ”
that 's no explanation , of course .
there is little evidence that dormund run more or tackle harder than , say , cologne or gladbach .
the worst of all sports cliches notwithstanding , no one is physically able to give more than 100 percent .
nor is dortmund 's form down to luck : the team ’ s average margin of victory in their 14 wins has been more than two goals , and only four of their 43 points have come thanks to last-minute strikes .
so are dortmund , in fact , more talented ?
the answer is yes and no .
playing in the other guys ' half bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever excitable juergen klopp is the architect of dortmund 's success keeping possession and winning challenges are two factors often credited for teams ' abilities to win games , but dortmund 's record this season in these categories is only slightly better than average .
where dortmund do have a striking advantage is in shots on goal , both for and against .
klopp 's men have sent the ball toward the opponents ’ goal 14 times more than the next-best team in this area , bayern munich .
and they 've allowed the opposition 21 fewer opportunities than their nearest rivals leverkusen .
dortmund have mastered the fine art of pressing , as was on ample display in the bremen match .
in the first half , bremen actually had slightly more possession and won more challenges , but the overall impression was that dortmund were dominating .
much of the game was played in bremen 's half , regardless of which team had the ball .
as a result , dortmund got up close and personal with bremen keeper tim wiese on several occasions , while bremen managed a grand total of just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes .
dortmund have been getting four or five men into opponents ' penalty areas all season , and not surprisingly , they 're the league 's most potent offensive force .
but if you think forward pressing only pays dividends on attack , think again .
keeping foes at bay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund get a lot of players forward with only nine goals conceded , dortmund are the best defensive unit in the league by far .
much of the credit has rightly gone to their fantastic center-back duo of neven subotic and mats hummels , but klopp 's system itself is also a major factor .
pushing the game into the opponent 's half extends the amount of territory that has to be covered on counter-attacks and forces opposing strikers to play out of position .
against bremen , for instance , werder striker claudio pizarro spent much of the match around the half-way line , looking for all the world like a man searching for a mobile phone that had dropped out of his pocket and mysteriously disappeared in the grass .
productive pressing , of course , requires precise positional play .
when dortmund double up on an opponent with the ball in his own half , the other players have to fan out and cover the space theoretically opened up for long passes .
led by midfield general nuri sahin , who 's become arguably the smartest player in the german game , dortmund do this exceptionally well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's men also keep their shape at the back and defending in opponents ' halves has another benefit .
dortmund have picked up only 21 yellow cards and have yet to have a man sent off .
that 's because the sorts of fouls pressing teams usually commit are n't those that lead to bookings .
dortmund have n't been racking up wins because they run harder and win more challenges , but because they run to the spots on the pitch where games are usually decided and take the ball off opponents in positions where it 's relatively easy to generate shots on goal .
whether the ability to do this is more a matter or nature or nurture is probably a question best left to neurologists .
but one thing is clear as the men in yellow bid to make history : this is a very well coached team with a knack for doing the little things that win a lot of games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 14.12.2010 french competition authority says google is " dominant " in france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french wants to further regulate google 's behavior french commercial regulator says that france " can apply limits to google 's actions . "
the silicon valley titan dismisses the 100-page opinion . on tuesday , the french autorité de la concurrence -lrb- competition authority -rrb- declared that " google holds a dominant position on the advertising market linked to search engines . "
in a 100-page opinion posted to its website , the authority noted that french competition law " can apply limits to google 's actions and provide a response to the competitive stakes brought to light by the actors , without the need to implement sector-wide regulations . "
this declaration comes less than a month after the european commission began its antitrust investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
the document outlines three main sources of complaint against google , which include competing search engines , website editors , and the press .
in addition to calling for google to be more transparent in advertising , the authority raised the possibility of an online expansion of the " sapin law , " a 1993 french law that creates more transparency in advertising rates , which forces comapnies to reconcile the published prices for advertising time and space with the actual price charged .
google rejects french regulatory opinion in addition , the french government entity wants french media outlets to be able to " request and obtain exclusion from google news , but without necessarily being delisted by the google search engine . "
in a statement emailed tuesday to deutsche welle , the company called the french analysis " too narrow . "
" search ads are one of many options for advertisers , " google said .
" if the price of search ads rises , advertisers can and do switch to other formats , both online and offline .
that 's the sign of a competitive and dynamic industry . "

but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit . even though german chancellor angela merkel has tried hard to squelch talk about issuing common european bonds , the idea is far from dead and is expected to generate plenty of debate at the next european union finance ministers ' summit , which begins on thursday .
" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

but some leaders still like the idea and plan to bring it up again at this week 's eu summit . even though german chancellor angela merkel has tried hard to squelch talk about issuing common european bonds , the idea is far from dead and is expected to generate plenty of debate at the next european union finance ministers ' summit , which begins on thursday .
" eurobonds make sense and can work , " said zsolt darvas , a researcher with the brussels-based think tank bruegel .
" and increasing market pressure in the months ahead could lead to action . "
but the eurozone debt crises may have to grow far worse than it currently is before the region 's chief paymaster , germany , takes the big leap and agrees to european fiscal integration .
the country remains highly protective of its tight fiscal policy .
the debt crisis has eurozone finance ministers scrambling to find a long-term solution .
for weeks , financial markets have been sending them a clear message that piecemeal country-by-country bailouts – with loans at punishing rates tied to draconian austerity measures – wo n't solve the problem .
jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers , and italian economy minister giulio tremonti , believe they have a solution .
last week , they hatched their " e-bond " idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker is a proponent of shared borrowing among eurozone members e-bonds , they argue , could theoretically relieve pressure on the weakest members of the single currency bloc by giving them lower financing costs .
they could also deter speculators and protect the euro .
unified against speculation under the proposal , a european debt agency would collectively issue guaranteed e-bonds to cover approximately half of a member state 's borrowing needs at a uniform low interest rate .
the country would use its own national debt instruments to cover the rest – but without a european guarantee and at correspondingly higher market rates .
the main advantage : " speculation of the euro failing would be ended , " michael schroeder , an economist with the centre for european economic research in mannheim , told deutsche welle .
earlier this year , bruegel researchers published a proposal similar to the one hatched by juncker and tremonti .
it calls for eu countries to pool up to 60 percent of their gross domestic product as " blue bonds . "
an independent council would propose the allocation of these bonds based on a review of national budgets .
the remaining " red bonds " would be issued nationally , with clauses allowing for an orderly default .
darvas does n't see any disadvantages with eurobonds if they are limited to between 40 and 60 percent of gdp .
" most countries can service debt up to 60 percent of gdp , " he said .
franco-german opposition for now , though , eurobonds appear to be dead in the water due to a resounding rejection by germany and france .
after a meeting with merkel last week , french president nicolas sarkozy said french and german citizens would not be pleased if they were forced to share the debts of other countries .
he added that the economies of the eurozone were too different and that the political integration of the eu was still insufficient to support such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel stand shoulder to should in their opposition to common debt germany , in particular , fears that eurobonds could raise its borrowing costs , which at 1.73 percent are among the lowest in europe .
by comparison , the average bond yield , or interest rate charged on sovereign debt , across the eurozone is slightly above 3 percent .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday said a common eurozone bond would therefore cost germany at least 17 billion euros -lrb- 22 billion dollars -rrb- more per year .
the german government also believes a collective eurozone debt pool would dissuade other nations from implementing the economic reforms required to reduce their budget deficits .
moreover , policymakers in berlin point to a legal hurdle that could prevent the creation of common bonds or mutual credit guarantees : the principle of national liability for public debt enshrined in the eu treaty 's " no bailout " clause .
germany managed to sneak around the no-bailout principle when it lent money to greece , arguing that its own financial stability was at stake .
but the german government has indicated it has intentions of making bailouts a regular habit .
good cop , bad cop ?
unlike merkel , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble appears to be more receptive to the eurobond idea , though he admits it would require changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel see opportunities and threats in the eurobond concept " we have a common monetary policy but not a common fiscal policy ; " he said in an english-language interview with the financial times .
" therefore , we need new rules and also incentives . "
observers in berlin are undecided whether merkel and schaeuble actually disagree on eurobonds or whether they are pursuing a " good cop , bad cop " strategy aimed at gaining concessions from other eurozone members on a greater political union .

"
the silicon valley titan dismisses the 100-page opinion . on tuesday , the french autorité de la concurrence -lrb- competition authority -rrb- declared that " google holds a dominant position on the advertising market linked to search engines . "
in a 100-page opinion posted to its website , the authority noted that french competition law " can apply limits to google 's actions and provide a response to the competitive stakes brought to light by the actors , without the need to implement sector-wide regulations . "
this declaration comes less than a month after the european commission began its antitrust investigation into google , examining the question of whether the californian search giant has abused its overwhelming market share .
the document outlines three main sources of complaint against google , which include competing search engines , website editors , and the press .
in addition to calling for google to be more transparent in advertising , the authority raised the possibility of an online expansion of the " sapin law , " a 1993 french law that creates more transparency in advertising rates , which forces comapnies to reconcile the published prices for advertising time and space with the actual price charged .
google rejects french regulatory opinion in addition , the french government entity wants french media outlets to be able to " request and obtain exclusion from google news , but without necessarily being delisted by the google search engine . "
in a statement emailed tuesday to deutsche welle , the company called the french analysis " too narrow . "
" search ads are one of many options for advertisers , " google said .
" if the price of search ads rises , advertisers can and do switch to other formats , both online and offline .
that 's the sign of a competitive and dynamic industry . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.12.2010 openleaks aims to provide a more transparent alternative to wikileaks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel domscheit-berg is a co-founder of openleaks in an interview with dw , openleaks co-founder daniel domscheit-berg compares his new site to wikileaks .
he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

he and other ex-wikileaks staffers want to democratize the process of leaking and whistle-blowing through this site . on monday , the site openleaks.org officially launched .
founded by former wikileaks staffers , including daniel domscheit-berg who previously had been a wikileaks spokesperson in germany , the site aims to provide an online drop box platform that many different sites can use .
the site will also have a foundation and organization behind it that will lobby for whistle-blowing-related legislation in germany .
it also promotes clear transparency , in contrast to the shadowy wikileaks , whose founder , julian assange , was arrested in london last week .
to learn more about the site , deutsche welle spoke with daniel domscheit-berg , one of the site 's co-founders .
deutsche welle : so , what is openleaks ?
daniel domscheit-berg : the openleaks project aims at providing technology to parties all around the world to enable these parties to receive documents from anonymous sources .
this will regard documents or any other kind of information that people would like to relay to news media organizations , to labor unions , to ngos , or to whoever else with an interest in running a post drop in the digital world to get in touch with sources of material .
i think a lot of people are going to connect your background with wikileaks to this new project and see it as a spinoff , or perhaps even as a competitor to wikileaks .
is that your intention ?
no , that is not the intention at all .
the experience that i had at wikileaks and that others had is that the world actually needs more portals like wikileaks , more websites that enable people to distribute information , to disseminate information to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg disassociated himself from wikileaks and founder julian assange due to disagreements in september is the idea that people would come directly to the openleaks website just like they do now with wikileaks and drop information , or is the idea that the openleaks platform itself could be used on other types of websites ?
the openleaks website itself will not have a submission mechanism .
you can not go to the website and submit a document .
what we will do is provide the means to receive such documents to other organizations and then publish stories based on these organizations publishing these documents themselves .
how is openleaks organized ?
what is its organizational structure ?
we are still in development .
we are just around 10 people working on this idea , on laying a fundamental basis for this project to start off .
this will be kickstarted by explaining what we are to the public on our website .
and at the same time , sometime in the next few weeks or months , we are going to start by creating a foundation here in germany that will deal with the topic of whistle-blowing .
so i think the whistle-blowing topic has enough momentum at the moment so that the public understands why it is important to have these mechanisms to enable people to make something immoral or something going on behind closed doors , to make that public .
we are aiming at creating a foundation to support these people and to support technology to protect these people , and for these people to submit documents .
this foundation will support the openleaks project and it will support whistle-blowing in general .
in the near-term , we are looking into establishing the proper mechanisms , resonsibilities , processes and all these things that will make sure that the people in the board of that foundation will have a say in the critical decisions that need to be taken in the openleaks platform .
we are looking into incorporating all of this properly .
we do n't want to expose that project to the same kinds of political pressure that the wikileaks project is suffering from right now .
because no one understands actually what the processes are , who is taking decisions , how the financials work and all of these sorts things are very obscure - where not even necessarily something bad is going on .
these guys are asking transparency from everyone else but they are not transparent themselves .
so i think a more open approach and a more organized approach is a better one because you are not going to fall prey to that kind of criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : openleaks hopes to be a more democratic alternative to wikileaks what implications does openleaks have for whistle-blowers ?
first of all , openleaks enables whistle-blowers to communicate more directly or get in touch with a particular organization that they trust or one that would be interested in certain materials .
on the other hand , i hope that it raises the profile of whistle-blowing also in such a way that we become more aware of the need of these laws to protect these whistle-blowers .
in most parts of the world , and here in germany for example , we have quite good protections for journalistic sources in such a way that a journalist does not have to testify against a source .
we do not have laws that protect these sources .
here in germany we have had a lot of approaches where people have tried to establish a legal framework , but this has not been successful .
so i can only hope that in the future this will become more obvious to the public that there is a need to give these guys a legal basis , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domscheit-berg wants the openleaks foundation to lobby for whistleblower protection laws essentially , you are putting that decision of what secrets to reveal and how to deal with these submitted documents out of the hands of openleaks , and into the hands of deutsche welle , der spiegel or whichever organization is using your platform .
it 's important to understand that there are mechanisms to make sure that if one media organization receives a document and they do n't want to report about it , just because it 's not politically convenient or there 's an economic interest not to publish this , that there are mechanisms within the system that ensure that other people will get access to the document , too .
so that 's what you need to ensure , and what you need to understand as well .
we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .

we are not trying to create a project that enables closed whistle-blowing systems .
we do not want to exclusively feed one media organization 's archives , and we do not want to enable companies to enable whistle-blowing systems where they are informed about something that 's going on in their company and they can get rid of the problem before it gets to the public .
these are two things that we are not aiming at , at all .
so in other words , all of the openleaks members potentially could have access to all of the documents from the others .
that is potentially correct , yes .
the devil is in the details .
what is certain is that the one who receives the document , initially , has an exclusive period of time where he can exclusively work with that material .
and this is based on the experiences that we had with media organizations , because that is just the economy of how media organizations work .
but then again , that is something the source should specify , too .
so , the source of a document should be able to say : ' i 'll give these people four weeks , because it 's a very complex topic , ' or ' this is such a hot document and it 's so important that this gets to the public immediately that they should only get 24 hours . '
so , there are some dynamics of how this works in detail .
but i think we have a very robust framework that will make sure that all the information that is put out will see the light in a way that is ideal for the source .

russia ’ s central bank had announced direct exchange transactions between the yuan and the ruble in april . the yuan trading in moscow had been scheduled to begin in september , before it was postponed .
in november , china ’ s banking officials already added the russian ruble to the foreign currency basket which is currently being traded at the shanghai stock exchange .
both countries have been planning for a long time to make their currencies mutually convertible .
russia ’ s president dmitry medvedev has repeatedly called for strengthening the role of regional reserve currencies .
alternatives to the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian advocates regional reserve currencies both countries are trying to establish their currencies as alternative international reserve currencies .
especially china is eager to reduce its dependency on the us dollar for trade transactions .
beijing is also concerned since its foreign exchange holdings are mostly in us dollars .
li daokui , a member of the central bank ’ s monetary policy committee , said earlier this year that the yuan ’ s internationalization was " inevitable . "
china ’ s government plans to fully introduce the yuan into the global currency markets by between 2020 and 2025 .
intensifying bilateral trade bilateral trade between china and russia reached 45.1 billion us dollars -lrb- 30.6 billion euros -rrb- in the first ten months of 2010 , according to the chinese embassy in moscow .
this means an increase of 43.4 percent compared to last year .
" it makes sense if two huge economies want to keep the influence of a third dominant economic power house out of their bilateral trade relations , " bhanu baweja from swiss bank ubs told the bloomberg news agency .
circumventing the dollar the commencing currency trade between china and russia can also be seen as a futher sign of growing trade relations .
about 13 percent of russia ’ s imports are from china – mostly finished products .
many russian companies involved in this kind of trade will appreciate the chance to buy chinese yuan .
chinese companies mostly buy timber , coal , oil and gas from russia .
by avoiding the conversion first from rubles into us dollars and then back to the yuan , companies will save at least 0.1 to 0.3 percent of the merchandise value .
the micex even claims the benefits will be much higher , at up to five percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies will profit from direct yuan-ruble trading more flexibility the two countries have agreed to set a middle rate of 4.6711 yuan for one ruble .
the currency pair is allowed to fluctuate five percent above or below the middle rate .
this is more than the three percent of fluctuation of the yuan in trading with the dollar .
at the same time the chinese central bank will continue its efforts for a more flexible exchange rate system , pegging the yuan to a basket of currencies rather than just the us dollar .
at the beginning , the daily trade volume at the micex is expected to be three million yuan -lrb- 335 thousand euros -rrb- , a small amount compared to the four to five billion us dollars and 200-300 million euros traded every day .

but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say volunteers working with children should also have criminal checks .
risk of endangering vulnerable children heinz hilgers of the german association for child protection warns that there are situations where visiting a family can be counterproductive .
" if you make a house visit on the basis of a phone call from a neighbor , who might have ulterior motives , it could damage the relationship with the existing social worker , " he told deutsche welle .
" in the case of child abuse , without having enough evidence to take the child away with you , the abuse could get worse . "
the government also plans to make it possible for doctors and psychologists to report suspicions about child abuse to social services , without breaching patient confidentiality .
at the moment this is a gray area with many states having differing laws .
although most child abuse happens within the family , schroeder also wants to introduce minimum standards across the board in schools and sports clubs .
schroeder wants to standardize systems that clubs have for investigating and documenting cases where child abuse is suspected .
employees working with young people will be required to have a certificate of good conduct following a criminal background check .
the government would make these child protection standards a precondition for organizations to get funding and an operating permit .
the measure has been criticized , however , because the background checks would n't apply to voluntary workers .
" for a child it does n't matter whether the person abusing him is paid or not .
it 's important that we do everything to reduce the chances of abuse , " said hilgers hilgers said that in principle he agreed with the government 's aims , but its success would depend on how well the policy was implemented .
" local government is strapped for cash at the moments and we 'll see if they are able to afford it .
i would have liked the federal government to have invested more , " hilgers told deutsche welle .
if the law is passed , it would come into force in january 2012 .

but critics question whether there 's enough money behind the plans . the german minister for families , kristina schroeder , presented a new child protection bill to parliament on tuesday .
it aims to provide support for problem families who show signs of stress and a tendency towards neglect , rather than put children into care , a practice which has increased by 81 % in the last 4 years according to the german association for child protection .
" with the new child protection law , i think we will establish a strong network to protect our children - a network which puts the wellbeing of the child in the centre , which relieves families in stressful situations and therefore protects children who are at risk and which makes us all responsible for protecting children , " schroeder said at a press conference .
the proposed law would set up an early intervention network comprising youth welfare offices , schools , health authorities , hospitals , doctors , pregnancy advice centers and the police .
midwives would start visiting families in need of assistance from pregnancy until a year after birth .
according to schroeder , one in ten families needs help after a child is born , which adds up to 60,000 families each year .
to cover the costs of providing midwives for these needy families , the government plans to invest 30 million euro each year in creating a nationwide infrastructure .
home visits controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder -lrb- right -rrb- says prevention and intervention are the keys to protecting children schroeder identified two main problems that germany faces in providing adequate child protection .
firstly , families where children are abused often start having difficulties during pregnancy ; schroeder says early intervention is essential if they are to be helped .
and midwives should continue to work with problem families up to a year after a child is born " the use of midwives is the linchpin of early intervention because they can not only advise on medical aspects , but also on parent-child relationships .
midwives enjoy a very special trust , especially on the part of the mother , " schroeder said in a press conference a second issue is that at the moment it 's possible for families to elude social workers and hide child abuse .
schroeder wants to put a stop to so-called hopping between youth welfare offices .
by moving house , families are currently able to drop under the radar of social services .
she wants to ensure that files concerning these families are passed on to the new welfare offices when families move house .
the family minister also wants to introduce compulsory home visits , if a child is deemed to be at risk and if such a visit would n't put the child in further danger .
" it 's clear that home visits are vital to protect children , especially for young children who are n't going to kindergarten yet , " schroeder said .
this could prove to be a contentious issue .
schroeder 's own christian democrats tried to introduce a similar measure during the previous government , but it was rejected by their then-coalition partners , the social democrats , who are now in opposition , but still have power to block measures in the second house of parliament .

but opposition parties complain of alleged fraud . the pdk party of kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci has won parliamentary elections , according to the country 's election commission on monday .
thaci is expected to form a coalition , although he may have trouble convincing his rivals to join him in government , as opposition parties continue to cry foul over alleged election fraud , with some refusing to serve as coalition partners .
thaci 's pdk won 33.5 percent of the vote , followed by its former coalition ally , the ldk , with 23.6 percent .
the vetevendosje party took third place with 12.2 percent .
voter turnout was just under 48 percent .
" this was a vote for the european kosovo , a referendum of citizens on our good governing , " thaci said .
opposition cries foul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.6 million people were eligible to vote in kosovo but opposition parties are concerned about electoral fraud , as some thaci strongholds showed an unusually high turnout .
" the turnout of 94 percent is statistically impossible , logically unreasonable , politically unacceptable and legally contestable in kosovo 's reality , " ldk spokesman arben gashi said of one of those strongholds .
european election monitors said they were aware of these allegations , but said it was a " generally well-organized election day , " according to doris pack , head of the european parliament observer mission .
in a joint statement , the eu 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton , and eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele praised kosovo for the " calm and orderly manner in which the majority of the voting took place . "
the elections are kosovo 's first since declaring independence from serbia in 2008 and are seen as a key test for the country 's democratic mettle and its suitability for eu membership .
the elections were called early after a vote of no-confidence was submitted two weeks after thaci 's coalition fell apart when former president fatmir sejidu pulled his party out of the governing coalition .
" it is important now to rapidly form a new government and to elect a new president , " said ashton 's and fuele 's statement .
" we have much work ahead of us in the coming year , so that kosovo can further advance towards the eu , " the statement read .

the vote follows a split between berlusconi 's ruling coalition and rebel deputies led by ex-ally gianfranco fini in july .
if he loses either vote , he will be forced to offer his resignation to president giorgio napolitano , who will then decide whether an alternative center-right majority can be formed .
shattered reputation while berlusconi insists that italians still adore him , reality is proving different .
with a slew of sex scandals , a paralyzed economy , nationwide protests and his own loyal backers turning against him , his base of support has eroded .
despite feverish negotiations and backroom deals with rumors of cash or jobs in exchange for support , most predict the leader wo n't make it through the key vote , but analysts say he is determined to fight for survival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister has been the butt of jokes after a slew of sex scandals " his demand of the party and those close to him is complete , utter and blind loyalty , " longtime italy commentator christopher winner told deutsche welle .
" he 's attacking strongly , making it seem like he 's been unjustly challenged , and by appearing strong and unwavering , he hopes to survive what amounts to a mutiny , " he added .
allegations of corruption mutiny is not berlusconi 's only problem .
italy 's high court is poised to rule on whether a law berlusconi had passed to protect himself from prosecution while prime minister is constitutional .
if struck down , he will immediately face charges for corrupting a judge .
antonio di pietro is the former judge renowned for prosecuting corrupt businessmen and politicians in the clean hands investigations of the early 1990s .
now an opposition politician , di pietro says berlusconi 's whole political career is tied to his business problems .
" berlusconi entered politics as a legal strategy , " he said .
" he went into politics to change the laws he was breaking .
so if his sole reason to go into politics was to change the laws to get him off corruption charges , it 's easy to understand why he 's been bad for the country . "
more and more italians appear to agree with di pietro .
latest polls show that fewer than 30 percent of italians want berlusconi to finish his current term .
politicians opposing him would like to put together short-term coalition government with someone else at the helm .
but berlusconi is threatening to call an election if he loses the no-confidence vote - something most italians do not want .

judge howard riddle granted assange release on a 200,000-pound -lrb- 236,000 euros , $ 315,000 -rrb- bail ahead of another hearing on jan .
11 , but his release was delayed as prosecutors representing sweden said they would appeal the decision .
riddle ordered assange to remain in custody until a new hearing is held within 48 hours .
several of assange 's supporters have offered to pay his bail for him .
he would have to wear an electronic tag to monitor his location as part of the conditions of his release .
earlier in the day assange relayed a message through his mother christine , who reportedly traveled from her native australia to be with her son , saying his " convictions are unfaltering " and that he remains " true to the ideals " he has expressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange gave himself up to police on december 7 " these circumstances shall not shake them , " he said .
" if anything , this process has increased my determination that they are true and correct . "
assange has said the sex charges in sweden are fabrications designed to silence him and his organization , and that they stem from a dispute over " consensual but unprotected sex . "
visa , mastercard and paypal criticized in the statement , assange also criticized major finance companies visa , mastercard and paypal for suspending payments to his wikileaks site , claiming they were under us control as " instruments of foreign policy . "
he called on the world " to protect my work and my people from these illegal and immoral acts . "
last week internet activists managed to shut down the visa and mastercard sites as well as that of the swedish government in protest to their perceived obstruction of wikileaks 's operations .

assange and his lawyers have voiced fears that us prosecutors may intend to indict him for espionage after the wikileaks website published the documents .
even if he is cleared of the sexual assault charges , he may soon be in the dock facing a completely different set of accusations .

co2 tied to individual consumption accounts for much of countries ' overall emissions . per capita carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions in germany dropped between 2008 and 2009 according to the latest figures , released by the federal statistics office on monday .
direct and indirect co2 emissions from private households in germany last year totaled 618 million tons - or an average of 7.5 tons per person .
though the 0.1 ton decrease over last year 's figure constitutes a small reduction , individual emissions have dropped by about 5 percent since 2000 .
" the decrease is certainly viewed as positive , " helmut mayer , an analyst with the federal statistics office , told deutsche welle in an email .
mayer said german households had already cut their energy consumption considerably .
home heating and the use of petrol for cars are forms of " direct " emissions , which totaled some 216 million tons for 2009 .
overall , direct co2 output by german households sank by nearly 7 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
as to whether that trend would continue , mayer pointed to germany 's focus on clean power sources : " domestically , the expansion of renewable energies will lead to net savings , " mayer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indirect emissions are associated with the production of consumer products not just a drop in the bucket germany 's latest figures on household emissions come on the heels of united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , which ended with a compromise agreement early saturday morning .
co2 output due to household consumption is an important part of countries ' total greenhouse gas output – a statistic calculated based on countries ' overall emissions levels .
individuals and households are responsible for 72 percent of greenhouse gas emissions , according to edgar hertwich , professor of industrial ecology at the norwegian university of science and technology .
hertwich , who was involved in the prestigious " carbon footprint of nations " research project that analyzed global co2 emissions , told deutsche welle that public consumption and investments in resources like roads and new buildings accounted for the remainder of the emissions total .
while he praised germany 's federal statistics office for taking on the topic of individual emissions , he said the reductions noted in germany were " surprising " .
" they actually contradict what we have seen from other countries in europe , " hertwich said , citing norway and the united kingdom as examples of countries whose carbon footprints are growing .
there , substantial increases in imports from toys to tv sets - especially goods produced in developing countries - has led to corresponding increases in individual emissions .
' indirect ' , consumption-related emissions measured in germany in 2009 included the output associated with the production of goods - both at home and abroad - used by german households .
this figure accounted for the bulk of germany 's total co2 output for individuals , with 402 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year .
" i would like to see the methods that were used to calculate those numbers , " hertwich added .
overall , carbon dioxide output associated with the production of consumer products dropped by 4.3 percent between 2000 and last year .
bildunterschrift : expansion of renewable energy sources has helped germany cut emissions the trends behind the trend changing consumer habits were largely responsible for the reported reductions , despite the fact that household consumption has increased overall .
germans were reportedly buying fewer tangible products and more services , which typically have a reduced carbon footprint compared to manufactured goods .
the german federal statistics office report credited more consumers switching to cars with diesel engines for part of the drop in direct emissions , while the move to natural gas from oil fuel helped slash heating-related co2 output .
but germany 's transition to carbon-neutral and other environmentally friendly sources of power has also played a major role .
about half of all co2 emissions related to the production of consumer goods are linked to energy generation .
the report said the country had increased its share of power won from renewable sources by nearly 10 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
hertwich praised germany as " one of the pioneers in renewable energy production , " but said achieving global emissions reductions targets would require " a substantial decrease " in greenhouse gas output - which could only be achieved with a carbon-free electricity sector and smart transportation solutions .
german environment minister norbert roettgen has called on europe to lead the way on that front , saying reductions are key to fulfilling the international community 's efforts to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius by 2020 .
" europe will only maintain its leading role in climate protection if we resolve to move forward and reduce our emissions by 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020 , " he told the german daily rheinische post in an interview published on monday .

it is now available for download , months after the game 's planned release sparked outrage among victims ' groups . the developer of a " first-person shooter " -style computer game , which lets participants take on the role of an east german border guard or escapee along the former east-west border , defended his project ahead of its release last friday evening , calling the game a way for younger generations to learn about germany 's history during the cold war .
the 24-year-old media arts student behind the controversial computer download , jens stober , said critics had never even seen the game , which was held back from its planned launch on germany 's anniversary of reunification , october 3 , following heated criticism .
" it has to be released today so that finally , everyone can form an opinion of it , " stober told a crowd of 100 gathered at the karlsruhe university of arts and design , ahead of the project 's premiere .
the game " 1378 km " - a reference to the total length of the boundary dividing east and west germany - triggered protests from victims ' advocacy groups in recent months , who argued that it was insensitive to those who had lived under east germany 's oppressive communist regime .
up to 16 gamers can play " 1378 km " at a time , and the game allows them to choose to be a border officer or an escapee in the year 1976 .
east german guards who catch a player trying to flee have three options : imprison him , escape with him , or shoot him .
but stober , who even received a death threat for creating the game , said it turned the " shoot- ' em-up " concept on its head , since points are deducted when players take aim at escapees .
" you shoot , you lose , " the game 's creator said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that it is a shooter game , the creator of ' 1378 km ' said : " you shoot , you lose . "
ongoing opposition stober 's game was still generating controversy ahead of its official launch last friday night , with the head of the uokg , a berlin-based umbrella group for victims of the communist dictatorship , calling on the university in karlsruhe not to release the game .
the uokg 's rainer wagner called for changes to be made and to " talk with the victims . "
referencing his own attempts to flee the inner-german border , which twice landed him behind bars , wagner said " 1378 km " would only serve to traumatize victims once more .
more than 100,000 east germans attempted to flee east germany between 1961 , when the border was built , and the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
according to the center for contemporary history in potsdam , 136 people were killed trying to flee along the berlin wall alone , with estimates ranging from 270 to 780 people dead along the entire border .
" do n't put the game on the internet , and do n't allow for the shooting of escapees , " wagner said . stober has said he would make changes to the game in the coming weeks but that he has no plans to remove the border soldiers component , calling it the " foundation of the game . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historians estimate hundreds of east germans died while trying to cross into west germany academic support meanwhile , the university 's vice rector uwe hochmuth said the school was prepared to engage in a dialogue with victims ' groups but that the process was dependent on the game 's release , which would allow people to form an opinion on the project .
members of the school 's faculty defended the game against moral and ethical challenges at friday 's meeting , making a case for artistic freedom .
" this work is an art project , and art has always tried to overstep boundaries , " the university 's head of media arts , michael bielicky said .
but another person attending the discussion ahead of the game 's launch claimed " 1378 km " had nothing to do with art - and moreover , that the game failed to address the gravity of the topic : " i crossed the border , and i 'm telling you that this game is nonsense .
this was a very defining experience for me , and i 'm disappointed that a game has been made out of it . " on more than one occasion , stober has made assurances that he is well-aware of the serious nature of his game 's subject matter .
he said he envisioned the game as an interactive way for his generation to experience the country 's cold war past .
stober reportedly spent a full year conducting research for the project . earlier on saturday , the game 's website reported that stress on the server had prevented users from downloading the game but said the problem had been resolved by the afternoon . author : amanda price -lrb- dpa , epd -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is reflected in the current economic data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ifo-index , says jochen möbert of deutsche bank economic research , has increased another time .
german economics are booming . even the logistic sector , not benefitting of the recovery before , is now catching up due to the high export demand and the investments worldwide . but möbert warns : a lot of european politicians are not aware of the problems in the euro zone and the uncertain future of the common currency .
there is no effective cooperation .
europe needs a bigger solution for the whole euro area , möbert claims . get the answers ! see our interview with deutsche bank research expert jochen möbert .

in the case of greece , it was mainly a persistently unsound fiscal policy that led to a loss of confidence among investors , while in ireland this was primarily due to a credit bubble which had inflated the size of the financial sector . " bail-out for german municipalities " in three federal states saxony-anhalt , lower saxony and rhine-land-palatinate bail-out programmes for municipalities have already been set up in the course of 2010 .
in other federal states including north rhine-westphalia and hesse as well as to some extent in schleswig-holstein and saarland they are being discussed or similar measures are in the offing . education opportunities may be key to attracting bright minds to germany the fact that germany needs qualified immigration is not at issue among experts .
however , critics are right in pointing out that qualified foreigners show limited interest in working in germany .
it would thus be more promising to attract bright young people to germany by offering them a good education . innovative capacity in the aftermath of the crisis companies in germany kept their r & d spending at least constant even in the crisis year 2009 .
this is a good foundation for ensuring they remain competitive in future .
one explanation for what is a very robust reaction from a historical perspective is that particularly technologically advanced companies can ’ t afford not to invest in r & d precisely on account of the stiff competition .
investment in innovative start-ups and patent filings have , by contrast , been hit harder by the financial and economic crisis .
this shows that companies ’ top priority is to safeguard their current research cycles but they are less inclined to develop completely new innovations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
