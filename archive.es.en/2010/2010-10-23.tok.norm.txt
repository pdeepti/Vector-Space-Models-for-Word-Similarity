speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

the waste is set to flow into germany from france starting next month . thousands of people in germany gathered saturday in protest against a plan that would see high-level radioactive atomic waste transported through their hometowns .
organizers report that nearly 20,000 people demonstrated in some 120 towns and cities located along the planned transport routes , from the southwestern city of karlsruhe to the tiny town of gorleben in the german state of lower saxony .
tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .
but activists want those plans stopped .
on saturday , the north-central city of hanover alone saw some 3,000 protestors , according to organizers .
police there spoke of 1,500 demonstrators .
in the city of greifswald some 30 protestors rolled barrels through the city , shouting , " we 'll bring you the waste . "
meanwhile , streets in the northern cities of bremen and rostock were overtaken by demonstrators on bicycles .

guenther oettinger , european commissioner for energy , told munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung in an interview published saturday that he plans to propose new eu guidelines for disposing nuclear waste on november 3 .

the waste is set to flow into germany from france starting next month . thousands of people in germany gathered saturday in protest against a plan that would see high-level radioactive atomic waste transported through their hometowns .
organizers report that nearly 20,000 people demonstrated in some 120 towns and cities located along the planned transport routes , from the southwestern city of karlsruhe to the tiny town of gorleben in the german state of lower saxony .
tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .
but activists want those plans stopped .
on saturday , the north-central city of hanover alone saw some 3,000 protestors , according to organizers .
police there spoke of 1,500 demonstrators .
in the city of greifswald some 30 protestors rolled barrels through the city , shouting , " we 'll bring you the waste . "
meanwhile , streets in the northern cities of bremen and rostock were overtaken by demonstrators on bicycles .

they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .
photo-books by edward steichen or building blocks by joaquin torres garcia are examples of toys that were meant to be mass-produced and developed with pedagogical intentions . " garcia is a good example of an artist who knew the educational theories of the 19th century and wanted to make a company and produce these toys that were very much made with these educational theories in mind , " lebrero stals said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin torres garcia planned to sell his building blocks one of the main discoveries lebrero stals and his co-curator carlos perez , head of exhibitions at the museo valenciano de la ilustracion y la modernidad in valencia , came across was that many of the avant-garde artists were knowledgeable about new pedagogical theories and saw toys as central to education . the avant-garde did n't want to just teach children their abcs and 123s , but rather lay the foundation for building utopian ideals .
within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia . " connecting with children though the exhibit focuses on the artistry and functional relationship between toys and education , there also is an emotional element that ca n't be overlooked , said gary cross , a professor of modern history at penn state who specializes in work and leisure in the 20th century . there were really two different themes in early 20th-century toys , and while some toys were aimed at education and preparing children for the modern world , others focused on the preservation of childhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul klee 's doll was created shortly after the end of world war i cross said there were a number of different groups at the beginning of 20th century interested in connecting to the child .
one of them was the so-called puppen reform movement , " which was about making dolls much more child-like , so as to produce emotions in children that were more innocent , instead of getting the child to adopt adult values , " he said . while the picasso museum hopes to interest children in art with this exhibition , as lebrero stals said , the exhibition will inevitably bring visitors closer to the child 's perspective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.10.2010 in big imf revamp , europe to lose influence to emerging economies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 leaders are meeting ahead of a summit in three weeks world leaders meeting ahead of a major g20 summit have laid the groundwork for what could be the biggest revamp of the international monetary fund since the body 's creation , giving greater power to developing countries . representatives of the group of 20 leading industrial nations on saturday reached an agreement on how to reform the international monetary fund , decreasing europe 's influence on decision-making and increasing that of developing nations like china and india .
speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "

" i am worried by what has been happening in campania in recent days , " he said .
" today 's situation leads us to believe that measures taken by italian authorities since 2007 are insufficient . "
he added that the violent clashes between residents and police over where to deposit naples ' trash show that " italian authorities have not yet done what is needed . "
he cited as proof that campania still had no waste management and that the region 's only incinerator " is not functioning properly and at full capacity . "
for more than a week people in naples have burned cars and italian flags and have thrown stones and firecrackers at police to protest the stench and poor conditions of their local landfill , as well as plans to build a new one in vesuvio national park .
clashes continued through friday night but had subsided on saturday .
the european court of justice found last march that italy 's failure to clean up naples ' streets was in violation of eu legislation .
if the european commission refers the matter back to the court , and if italy is found to still be in breach of the law , it could face millions of euros in fines .

the waste is set to flow into germany from france starting next month . thousands of people in germany gathered saturday in protest against a plan that would see high-level radioactive atomic waste transported through their hometowns .
organizers report that nearly 20,000 people demonstrated in some 120 towns and cities located along the planned transport routes , from the southwestern city of karlsruhe to the tiny town of gorleben in the german state of lower saxony .
tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .
but activists want those plans stopped .
on saturday , the north-central city of hanover alone saw some 3,000 protestors , according to organizers .
police there spoke of 1,500 demonstrators .
in the city of greifswald some 30 protestors rolled barrels through the city , shouting , " we 'll bring you the waste . "
meanwhile , streets in the northern cities of bremen and rostock were overtaken by demonstrators on bicycles .
bildunterschrift : protestors in juelich went to the local tracks to draw awareness bigger protests ahead a spokesperson for the anti-atomic initiative " ausgestrahlt " said saturday 's protests were a mere prelude to the demonstration planned for november 6 in the town of dannenberg , where he expected tens of thousands of protestors to participate .
the european commission meanwhile plans to increase pressure on eu member states to find a permanent solution to the problem of atomic waste storage .
guenther oettinger , european commissioner for energy , told munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung in an interview published saturday that he plans to propose new eu guidelines for disposing nuclear waste on november 3 .

" i am worried by what has been happening in campania in recent days , " he said .
" today 's situation leads us to believe that measures taken by italian authorities since 2007 are insufficient . "
he added that the violent clashes between residents and police over where to deposit naples ' trash show that " italian authorities have not yet done what is needed . "
he cited as proof that campania still had no waste management and that the region 's only incinerator " is not functioning properly and at full capacity . "
for more than a week people in naples have burned cars and italian flags and have thrown stones and firecrackers at police to protest the stench and poor conditions of their local landfill , as well as plans to build a new one in vesuvio national park .
clashes continued through friday night but had subsided on saturday .
the european court of justice found last march that italy 's failure to clean up naples ' streets was in violation of eu legislation .
if the european commission refers the matter back to the court , and if italy is found to still be in breach of the law , it could face millions of euros in fines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.10.2010 in big imf revamp , europe to lose influence to emerging economies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 leaders are meeting ahead of a summit in three weeks world leaders meeting ahead of a major g20 summit have laid the groundwork for what could be the biggest revamp of the international monetary fund since the body 's creation , giving greater power to developing countries . representatives of the group of 20 leading industrial nations on saturday reached an agreement on how to reform the international monetary fund , decreasing europe 's influence on decision-making and increasing that of developing nations like china and india .
speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 23.10.2010 italy faces massive fines for garbage cleanup failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors have been clashing with police over the trash as confrontations continue between italian police and protestors of the deteriorating garbage situation in naples , the european commission has threatened potential legal action against italy for violating european law . the european commission is considering legal action against italy for its failure to clean up the 2,000 tons of garbage that are littering the streets of naples janez potocnik , commissioner for the environment , said in a statement that the european union 's executive arm was considering sending a team of analysts to asses whether italy was still in breach of eu legislation requiring waste disposal to protect human health and the environment .
" i am worried by what has been happening in campania in recent days , " he said .
" today 's situation leads us to believe that measures taken by italian authorities since 2007 are insufficient . "
he added that the violent clashes between residents and police over where to deposit naples ' trash show that " italian authorities have not yet done what is needed . "
he cited as proof that campania still had no waste management and that the region 's only incinerator " is not functioning properly and at full capacity . "
for more than a week people in naples have burned cars and italian flags and have thrown stones and firecrackers at police to protest the stench and poor conditions of their local landfill , as well as plans to build a new one in vesuvio national park .
clashes continued through friday night but had subsided on saturday .
the european court of justice found last march that italy 's failure to clean up naples ' streets was in violation of eu legislation .
if the european commission refers the matter back to the court , and if italy is found to still be in breach of the law , it could face millions of euros in fines .

speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .

under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 23.10.2010 many immigrants choose hardship in spain over returning home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elhadri is hurting from the spanish downturn , but had adapted to his new country spain is offering jobless non-eu immigrants a one-time payout of unemployment benefits in exchange for surrendering their spanish residency rights .
but many immigrants are loath to leave their adopted home . south american and african immigrants in spain increasingly find themselves caught in a tough predicament .
unable to gain long-term employment in their host country , they see no attractive prospects back at home , either . despite high unemployment , many of these immigrants choose to remain in their host nations rather than return to their countries of origin . among them is moroccan immigrant ali elhadri , a construction worker who has found himself a victim of the collapse of spain 's construction industry . dashed hopes the 34-year-old moroccan had a much different vision of his future when he risked his life 12 years ago to come to europe in a boat which he described as " a little nutshell . " " there were 25 of us , and the boat was only five or six meters -lrb- 16-20 feet -rrb- long , " he told deutsche welle .
" we were practically stacked one on top of the other . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled labor positions in spain have gotten harder to come by elhadri said he and his fellow passengers came " with the illusion that we would find the land of our dreams .
but what awaited us was a harsh reality . " elhadri arrived at the time of spain 's construction boom and at first had no trouble finding work .
he soon received permanent residency status .
however , in the wake of the global financial crisis a decade later , many of spain 's construction companies have gone out of business . now jobless , elhadri can no longer count on state benefits .
a few weeks ago he stopped receiving unemployment benefits . he currently works on odd jobs , such as helping out friends with renovations . better jobless in spain than gone for good in the face of high unemployment rates among immigrants , spain came up with an initiative in 2008 to support jobless , non-eu citizens who want to return to their countries of origin .
in these cases , the government offers a one-time payout of immigrants ' full unemployment benefits . usually , the lump sum amounts to about 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,000 -rrb- .
however , the initiative has been far less popular than the government had expected .
only 1,400 immigrants took up the government ’ s offer in the program ’ s first two months . a likely reason is that immigrants who choose this option must give up their right to live in spain . " many immigrants leave feeling they 've failed , " said rocio redondo of spain 's red cross .
" of course they are thankful for the financial aid , but almost all of them have difficulty giving up their spanish papers . " redondo is in contact with many immigrants who would like to return to their countries of origin for a certain period , but said most give up their plans when they learn that they will not be allowed to return to spain .
it is difficult for people who are n't from europe to get a spanish visa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elhadri 's friend said is also unemployed but would rather try his luck in france than return to morocco hanging in sometimes elhadri and his friends toy with the notion of returning to morocco , where the construction industry is expanding and laborers are in demand .
yet elhadri is loath to take this option , saying he would have to accept wages of about six euros a day - the cost of a kilogram of meat . he also does not want to give up the freedoms he enjoys in spain .
elhadri said he has grown quite liberal in spain and can not imagine living in morocco , where he says religion pervades daily life . " life here in spain is good .
in terms of politics , there 's democracy , ” he said .
“ your rights are protected . "
that 's quite different from morocco , where he says corruption still rules . " even when you need something that you have a right to - like papers from a government office - you have to bribe people . " in spain to stay back when elhadri was still had a good income , he bought a house in morocco .
last year he married in his home country and had a daughter .
elhadri also has land back in morocco where he would like to start a vineyard , but he says he would need three or four years to establish wine production .
he would consider the project if it did n't mean losing his spanish residency . as it is , elhadri says , neither his unemployment nor his family could convince him to leave his adoptive spanish homeland . author : stephanie eichler -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .

" garcia is a good example of an artist who knew the educational theories of the 19th century and wanted to make a company and produce these toys that were very much made with these educational theories in mind , " lebrero stals said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin torres garcia planned to sell his building blocks one of the main discoveries lebrero stals and his co-curator carlos perez , head of exhibitions at the museo valenciano de la ilustracion y la modernidad in valencia , came across was that many of the avant-garde artists were knowledgeable about new pedagogical theories and saw toys as central to education . the avant-garde did n't want to just teach children their abcs and 123s , but rather lay the foundation for building utopian ideals .
within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia . " connecting with children though the exhibit focuses on the artistry and functional relationship between toys and education , there also is an emotional element that ca n't be overlooked , said gary cross , a professor of modern history at penn state who specializes in work and leisure in the 20th century . there were really two different themes in early 20th-century toys , and while some toys were aimed at education and preparing children for the modern world , others focused on the preservation of childhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul klee 's doll was created shortly after the end of world war i cross said there were a number of different groups at the beginning of 20th century interested in connecting to the child .

the waste is set to flow into germany from france starting next month . thousands of people in germany gathered saturday in protest against a plan that would see high-level radioactive atomic waste transported through their hometowns .
organizers report that nearly 20,000 people demonstrated in some 120 towns and cities located along the planned transport routes , from the southwestern city of karlsruhe to the tiny town of gorleben in the german state of lower saxony .
tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .
but activists want those plans stopped .
on saturday , the north-central city of hanover alone saw some 3,000 protestors , according to organizers .
police there spoke of 1,500 demonstrators .
in the city of greifswald some 30 protestors rolled barrels through the city , shouting , " we 'll bring you the waste . "
meanwhile , streets in the northern cities of bremen and rostock were overtaken by demonstrators on bicycles .
bildunterschrift : protestors in juelich went to the local tracks to draw awareness bigger protests ahead a spokesperson for the anti-atomic initiative " ausgestrahlt " said saturday 's protests were a mere prelude to the demonstration planned for november 6 in the town of dannenberg , where he expected tens of thousands of protestors to participate .
the european commission meanwhile plans to increase pressure on eu member states to find a permanent solution to the problem of atomic waste storage .
guenther oettinger , european commissioner for energy , told munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung in an interview published saturday that he plans to propose new eu guidelines for disposing nuclear waste on november 3 .

but many immigrants are loath to leave their adopted home . south american and african immigrants in spain increasingly find themselves caught in a tough predicament .
unable to gain long-term employment in their host country , they see no attractive prospects back at home , either . despite high unemployment , many of these immigrants choose to remain in their host nations rather than return to their countries of origin . among them is moroccan immigrant ali elhadri , a construction worker who has found himself a victim of the collapse of spain 's construction industry . dashed hopes the 34-year-old moroccan had a much different vision of his future when he risked his life 12 years ago to come to europe in a boat which he described as " a little nutshell . " " there were 25 of us , and the boat was only five or six meters -lrb- 16-20 feet -rrb- long , " he told deutsche welle .
" we were practically stacked one on top of the other . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled labor positions in spain have gotten harder to come by elhadri said he and his fellow passengers came " with the illusion that we would find the land of our dreams .
but what awaited us was a harsh reality . " elhadri arrived at the time of spain 's construction boom and at first had no trouble finding work .
he soon received permanent residency status .
however , in the wake of the global financial crisis a decade later , many of spain 's construction companies have gone out of business . now jobless , elhadri can no longer count on state benefits .
a few weeks ago he stopped receiving unemployment benefits . he currently works on odd jobs , such as helping out friends with renovations . better jobless in spain than gone for good in the face of high unemployment rates among immigrants , spain came up with an initiative in 2008 to support jobless , non-eu citizens who want to return to their countries of origin .
in these cases , the government offers a one-time payout of immigrants ' full unemployment benefits . usually , the lump sum amounts to about 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,000 -rrb- .
however , the initiative has been far less popular than the government had expected .
only 1,400 immigrants took up the government ’ s offer in the program ’ s first two months . a likely reason is that immigrants who choose this option must give up their right to live in spain . " many immigrants leave feeling they 've failed , " said rocio redondo of spain 's red cross .
" of course they are thankful for the financial aid , but almost all of them have difficulty giving up their spanish papers . " redondo is in contact with many immigrants who would like to return to their countries of origin for a certain period , but said most give up their plans when they learn that they will not be allowed to return to spain .
it is difficult for people who are n't from europe to get a spanish visa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elhadri 's friend said is also unemployed but would rather try his luck in france than return to morocco hanging in sometimes elhadri and his friends toy with the notion of returning to morocco , where the construction industry is expanding and laborers are in demand .
yet elhadri is loath to take this option , saying he would have to accept wages of about six euros a day - the cost of a kilogram of meat . he also does not want to give up the freedoms he enjoys in spain .
elhadri said he has grown quite liberal in spain and can not imagine living in morocco , where he says religion pervades daily life . " life here in spain is good .
in terms of politics , there 's democracy , ” he said .
“ your rights are protected . "
that 's quite different from morocco , where he says corruption still rules . " even when you need something that you have a right to - like papers from a government office - you have to bribe people . " in spain to stay back when elhadri was still had a good income , he bought a house in morocco .
last year he married in his home country and had a daughter .
elhadri also has land back in morocco where he would like to start a vineyard , but he says he would need three or four years to establish wine production .
he would consider the project if it did n't mean losing his spanish residency . as it is , elhadri says , neither his unemployment nor his family could convince him to leave his adoptive spanish homeland . author : stephanie eichler -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

the waste is set to flow into germany from france starting next month . thousands of people in germany gathered saturday in protest against a plan that would see high-level radioactive atomic waste transported through their hometowns .
organizers report that nearly 20,000 people demonstrated in some 120 towns and cities located along the planned transport routes , from the southwestern city of karlsruhe to the tiny town of gorleben in the german state of lower saxony .
tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .
but activists want those plans stopped .
on saturday , the north-central city of hanover alone saw some 3,000 protestors , according to organizers .
police there spoke of 1,500 demonstrators .
in the city of greifswald some 30 protestors rolled barrels through the city , shouting , " we 'll bring you the waste . "
meanwhile , streets in the northern cities of bremen and rostock were overtaken by demonstrators on bicycles .
bildunterschrift : protestors in juelich went to the local tracks to draw awareness bigger protests ahead a spokesperson for the anti-atomic initiative " ausgestrahlt " said saturday 's protests were a mere prelude to the demonstration planned for november 6 in the town of dannenberg , where he expected tens of thousands of protestors to participate .
the european commission meanwhile plans to increase pressure on eu member states to find a permanent solution to the problem of atomic waste storage .
guenther oettinger , european commissioner for energy , told munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung in an interview published saturday that he plans to propose new eu guidelines for disposing nuclear waste on november 3 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.10.2010 in big imf revamp , europe to lose influence to emerging economies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 leaders are meeting ahead of a summit in three weeks world leaders meeting ahead of a major g20 summit have laid the groundwork for what could be the biggest revamp of the international monetary fund since the body 's creation , giving greater power to developing countries . representatives of the group of 20 leading industrial nations on saturday reached an agreement on how to reform the international monetary fund , decreasing europe 's influence on decision-making and increasing that of developing nations like china and india .
speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

" today 's situation leads us to believe that measures taken by italian authorities since 2007 are insufficient . "
he added that the violent clashes between residents and police over where to deposit naples ' trash show that " italian authorities have not yet done what is needed . "
he cited as proof that campania still had no waste management and that the region 's only incinerator " is not functioning properly and at full capacity . "
for more than a week people in naples have burned cars and italian flags and have thrown stones and firecrackers at police to protest the stench and poor conditions of their local landfill , as well as plans to build a new one in vesuvio national park .
clashes continued through friday night but had subsided on saturday .
the european court of justice found last march that italy 's failure to clean up naples ' streets was in violation of eu legislation .
if the european commission refers the matter back to the court , and if italy is found to still be in breach of the law , it could face millions of euros in fines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 23.10.2010 when avant-garde artists made toys , they were n't playing around großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pablo picasso 's refrained from cubist influences with his toy car a conspicuous number of avant-garde artists tried their hand at making toys .
they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .
photo-books by edward steichen or building blocks by joaquin torres garcia are examples of toys that were meant to be mass-produced and developed with pedagogical intentions . " garcia is a good example of an artist who knew the educational theories of the 19th century and wanted to make a company and produce these toys that were very much made with these educational theories in mind , " lebrero stals said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin torres garcia planned to sell his building blocks one of the main discoveries lebrero stals and his co-curator carlos perez , head of exhibitions at the museo valenciano de la ilustracion y la modernidad in valencia , came across was that many of the avant-garde artists were knowledgeable about new pedagogical theories and saw toys as central to education . the avant-garde did n't want to just teach children their abcs and 123s , but rather lay the foundation for building utopian ideals .
within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia . " connecting with children though the exhibit focuses on the artistry and functional relationship between toys and education , there also is an emotional element that ca n't be overlooked , said gary cross , a professor of modern history at penn state who specializes in work and leisure in the 20th century . there were really two different themes in early 20th-century toys , and while some toys were aimed at education and preparing children for the modern world , others focused on the preservation of childhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul klee 's doll was created shortly after the end of world war i cross said there were a number of different groups at the beginning of 20th century interested in connecting to the child .
one of them was the so-called puppen reform movement , " which was about making dolls much more child-like , so as to produce emotions in children that were more innocent , instead of getting the child to adopt adult values , " he said . while the picasso museum hopes to interest children in art with this exhibition , as lebrero stals said , the exhibition will inevitably bring visitors closer to the child 's perspective . " parents and artists sometimes seek inspiration from children because the assumption is that children have an innocence and fresh modern view of the world , " said cross . author : sylvia smith -lrb- rf -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the waste is set to flow into germany from france starting next month . thousands of people in germany gathered saturday in protest against a plan that would see high-level radioactive atomic waste transported through their hometowns .
organizers report that nearly 20,000 people demonstrated in some 120 towns and cities located along the planned transport routes , from the southwestern city of karlsruhe to the tiny town of gorleben in the german state of lower saxony .
tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .
but activists want those plans stopped .
on saturday , the north-central city of hanover alone saw some 3,000 protestors , according to organizers .
police there spoke of 1,500 demonstrators .

tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .

speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

" i am worried by what has been happening in campania in recent days , " he said .
" today 's situation leads us to believe that measures taken by italian authorities since 2007 are insufficient . "
he added that the violent clashes between residents and police over where to deposit naples ' trash show that " italian authorities have not yet done what is needed . "
he cited as proof that campania still had no waste management and that the region 's only incinerator " is not functioning properly and at full capacity . "
for more than a week people in naples have burned cars and italian flags and have thrown stones and firecrackers at police to protest the stench and poor conditions of their local landfill , as well as plans to build a new one in vesuvio national park .
clashes continued through friday night but had subsided on saturday .
the european court of justice found last march that italy 's failure to clean up naples ' streets was in violation of eu legislation .
if the european commission refers the matter back to the court , and if italy is found to still be in breach of the law , it could face millions of euros in fines .

they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .
photo-books by edward steichen or building blocks by joaquin torres garcia are examples of toys that were meant to be mass-produced and developed with pedagogical intentions . " garcia is a good example of an artist who knew the educational theories of the 19th century and wanted to make a company and produce these toys that were very much made with these educational theories in mind , " lebrero stals said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin torres garcia planned to sell his building blocks one of the main discoveries lebrero stals and his co-curator carlos perez , head of exhibitions at the museo valenciano de la ilustracion y la modernidad in valencia , came across was that many of the avant-garde artists were knowledgeable about new pedagogical theories and saw toys as central to education . the avant-garde did n't want to just teach children their abcs and 123s , but rather lay the foundation for building utopian ideals .
within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia . " connecting with children though the exhibit focuses on the artistry and functional relationship between toys and education , there also is an emotional element that ca n't be overlooked , said gary cross , a professor of modern history at penn state who specializes in work and leisure in the 20th century . there were really two different themes in early 20th-century toys , and while some toys were aimed at education and preparing children for the modern world , others focused on the preservation of childhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul klee 's doll was created shortly after the end of world war i cross said there were a number of different groups at the beginning of 20th century interested in connecting to the child .
one of them was the so-called puppen reform movement , " which was about making dolls much more child-like , so as to produce emotions in children that were more innocent , instead of getting the child to adopt adult values , " he said . while the picasso museum hopes to interest children in art with this exhibition , as lebrero stals said , the exhibition will inevitably bring visitors closer to the child 's perspective .

" i am worried by what has been happening in campania in recent days , " he said .
" today 's situation leads us to believe that measures taken by italian authorities since 2007 are insufficient . "
he added that the violent clashes between residents and police over where to deposit naples ' trash show that " italian authorities have not yet done what is needed . "
he cited as proof that campania still had no waste management and that the region 's only incinerator " is not functioning properly and at full capacity . "
for more than a week people in naples have burned cars and italian flags and have thrown stones and firecrackers at police to protest the stench and poor conditions of their local landfill , as well as plans to build a new one in vesuvio national park .
clashes continued through friday night but had subsided on saturday .
the european court of justice found last march that italy 's failure to clean up naples ' streets was in violation of eu legislation .
if the european commission refers the matter back to the court , and if italy is found to still be in breach of the law , it could face millions of euros in fines .

the waste is set to flow into germany from france starting next month . thousands of people in germany gathered saturday in protest against a plan that would see high-level radioactive atomic waste transported through their hometowns .
organizers report that nearly 20,000 people demonstrated in some 120 towns and cities located along the planned transport routes , from the southwestern city of karlsruhe to the tiny town of gorleben in the german state of lower saxony .
tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .
but activists want those plans stopped .
on saturday , the north-central city of hanover alone saw some 3,000 protestors , according to organizers .
police there spoke of 1,500 demonstrators .
in the city of greifswald some 30 protestors rolled barrels through the city , shouting , " we 'll bring you the waste . "
meanwhile , streets in the northern cities of bremen and rostock were overtaken by demonstrators on bicycles .
bildunterschrift : protestors in juelich went to the local tracks to draw awareness bigger protests ahead a spokesperson for the anti-atomic initiative " ausgestrahlt " said saturday 's protests were a mere prelude to the demonstration planned for november 6 in the town of dannenberg , where he expected tens of thousands of protestors to participate .
the european commission meanwhile plans to increase pressure on eu member states to find a permanent solution to the problem of atomic waste storage .
guenther oettinger , european commissioner for energy , told munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung in an interview published saturday that he plans to propose new eu guidelines for disposing nuclear waste on november 3 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.10.2010 in big imf revamp , europe to lose influence to emerging economies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 leaders are meeting ahead of a summit in three weeks world leaders meeting ahead of a major g20 summit have laid the groundwork for what could be the biggest revamp of the international monetary fund since the body 's creation , giving greater power to developing countries . representatives of the group of 20 leading industrial nations on saturday reached an agreement on how to reform the international monetary fund , decreasing europe 's influence on decision-making and increasing that of developing nations like china and india .
speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

but many immigrants are loath to leave their adopted home . south american and african immigrants in spain increasingly find themselves caught in a tough predicament .
unable to gain long-term employment in their host country , they see no attractive prospects back at home , either . despite high unemployment , many of these immigrants choose to remain in their host nations rather than return to their countries of origin . among them is moroccan immigrant ali elhadri , a construction worker who has found himself a victim of the collapse of spain 's construction industry . dashed hopes the 34-year-old moroccan had a much different vision of his future when he risked his life 12 years ago to come to europe in a boat which he described as " a little nutshell . " " there were 25 of us , and the boat was only five or six meters -lrb- 16-20 feet -rrb- long , " he told deutsche welle .
" we were practically stacked one on top of the other . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled labor positions in spain have gotten harder to come by elhadri said he and his fellow passengers came " with the illusion that we would find the land of our dreams .
but what awaited us was a harsh reality . " elhadri arrived at the time of spain 's construction boom and at first had no trouble finding work .
he soon received permanent residency status .
however , in the wake of the global financial crisis a decade later , many of spain 's construction companies have gone out of business . now jobless , elhadri can no longer count on state benefits .
a few weeks ago he stopped receiving unemployment benefits . he currently works on odd jobs , such as helping out friends with renovations . better jobless in spain than gone for good in the face of high unemployment rates among immigrants , spain came up with an initiative in 2008 to support jobless , non-eu citizens who want to return to their countries of origin .
in these cases , the government offers a one-time payout of immigrants ' full unemployment benefits . usually , the lump sum amounts to about 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,000 -rrb- .
however , the initiative has been far less popular than the government had expected .
only 1,400 immigrants took up the government ’ s offer in the program ’ s first two months . a likely reason is that immigrants who choose this option must give up their right to live in spain . " many immigrants leave feeling they 've failed , " said rocio redondo of spain 's red cross .
" of course they are thankful for the financial aid , but almost all of them have difficulty giving up their spanish papers . " redondo is in contact with many immigrants who would like to return to their countries of origin for a certain period , but said most give up their plans when they learn that they will not be allowed to return to spain .
it is difficult for people who are n't from europe to get a spanish visa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elhadri 's friend said is also unemployed but would rather try his luck in france than return to morocco hanging in sometimes elhadri and his friends toy with the notion of returning to morocco , where the construction industry is expanding and laborers are in demand .
yet elhadri is loath to take this option , saying he would have to accept wages of about six euros a day - the cost of a kilogram of meat . he also does not want to give up the freedoms he enjoys in spain .
elhadri said he has grown quite liberal in spain and can not imagine living in morocco , where he says religion pervades daily life . " life here in spain is good .
in terms of politics , there 's democracy , ” he said .
“ your rights are protected . "
that 's quite different from morocco , where he says corruption still rules . " even when you need something that you have a right to - like papers from a government office - you have to bribe people . " in spain to stay back when elhadri was still had a good income , he bought a house in morocco .
last year he married in his home country and had a daughter .
elhadri also has land back in morocco where he would like to start a vineyard , but he says he would need three or four years to establish wine production .
he would consider the project if it did n't mean losing his spanish residency . as it is , elhadri says , neither his unemployment nor his family could convince him to leave his adoptive spanish homeland . author : stephanie eichler -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .

under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 23.10.2010 when avant-garde artists made toys , they were n't playing around großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pablo picasso 's refrained from cubist influences with his toy car a conspicuous number of avant-garde artists tried their hand at making toys .
they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .
photo-books by edward steichen or building blocks by joaquin torres garcia are examples of toys that were meant to be mass-produced and developed with pedagogical intentions . " garcia is a good example of an artist who knew the educational theories of the 19th century and wanted to make a company and produce these toys that were very much made with these educational theories in mind , " lebrero stals said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin torres garcia planned to sell his building blocks one of the main discoveries lebrero stals and his co-curator carlos perez , head of exhibitions at the museo valenciano de la ilustracion y la modernidad in valencia , came across was that many of the avant-garde artists were knowledgeable about new pedagogical theories and saw toys as central to education . the avant-garde did n't want to just teach children their abcs and 123s , but rather lay the foundation for building utopian ideals .
within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia . " connecting with children though the exhibit focuses on the artistry and functional relationship between toys and education , there also is an emotional element that ca n't be overlooked , said gary cross , a professor of modern history at penn state who specializes in work and leisure in the 20th century . there were really two different themes in early 20th-century toys , and while some toys were aimed at education and preparing children for the modern world , others focused on the preservation of childhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul klee 's doll was created shortly after the end of world war i cross said there were a number of different groups at the beginning of 20th century interested in connecting to the child .
one of them was the so-called puppen reform movement , " which was about making dolls much more child-like , so as to produce emotions in children that were more innocent , instead of getting the child to adopt adult values , " he said . while the picasso museum hopes to interest children in art with this exhibition , as lebrero stals said , the exhibition will inevitably bring visitors closer to the child 's perspective . " parents and artists sometimes seek inspiration from children because the assumption is that children have an innocence and fresh modern view of the world , " said cross . author : sylvia smith -lrb- rf -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the waste is set to flow into germany from france starting next month . thousands of people in germany gathered saturday in protest against a plan that would see high-level radioactive atomic waste transported through their hometowns .
organizers report that nearly 20,000 people demonstrated in some 120 towns and cities located along the planned transport routes , from the southwestern city of karlsruhe to the tiny town of gorleben in the german state of lower saxony .
tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .

but many immigrants are loath to leave their adopted home . south american and african immigrants in spain increasingly find themselves caught in a tough predicament .
unable to gain long-term employment in their host country , they see no attractive prospects back at home , either . despite high unemployment , many of these immigrants choose to remain in their host nations rather than return to their countries of origin . among them is moroccan immigrant ali elhadri , a construction worker who has found himself a victim of the collapse of spain 's construction industry . dashed hopes the 34-year-old moroccan had a much different vision of his future when he risked his life 12 years ago to come to europe in a boat which he described as " a little nutshell . " " there were 25 of us , and the boat was only five or six meters -lrb- 16-20 feet -rrb- long , " he told deutsche welle .
" we were practically stacked one on top of the other . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled labor positions in spain have gotten harder to come by elhadri said he and his fellow passengers came " with the illusion that we would find the land of our dreams .
but what awaited us was a harsh reality . " elhadri arrived at the time of spain 's construction boom and at first had no trouble finding work .
he soon received permanent residency status .
however , in the wake of the global financial crisis a decade later , many of spain 's construction companies have gone out of business . now jobless , elhadri can no longer count on state benefits .
a few weeks ago he stopped receiving unemployment benefits . he currently works on odd jobs , such as helping out friends with renovations . better jobless in spain than gone for good in the face of high unemployment rates among immigrants , spain came up with an initiative in 2008 to support jobless , non-eu citizens who want to return to their countries of origin .
in these cases , the government offers a one-time payout of immigrants ' full unemployment benefits . usually , the lump sum amounts to about 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,000 -rrb- .
however , the initiative has been far less popular than the government had expected .
only 1,400 immigrants took up the government ’ s offer in the program ’ s first two months . a likely reason is that immigrants who choose this option must give up their right to live in spain . " many immigrants leave feeling they 've failed , " said rocio redondo of spain 's red cross .
" of course they are thankful for the financial aid , but almost all of them have difficulty giving up their spanish papers . " redondo is in contact with many immigrants who would like to return to their countries of origin for a certain period , but said most give up their plans when they learn that they will not be allowed to return to spain .
it is difficult for people who are n't from europe to get a spanish visa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elhadri 's friend said is also unemployed but would rather try his luck in france than return to morocco hanging in sometimes elhadri and his friends toy with the notion of returning to morocco , where the construction industry is expanding and laborers are in demand .
yet elhadri is loath to take this option , saying he would have to accept wages of about six euros a day - the cost of a kilogram of meat . he also does not want to give up the freedoms he enjoys in spain .
elhadri said he has grown quite liberal in spain and can not imagine living in morocco , where he says religion pervades daily life . " life here in spain is good .
in terms of politics , there 's democracy , ” he said .
“ your rights are protected . "
that 's quite different from morocco , where he says corruption still rules . " even when you need something that you have a right to - like papers from a government office - you have to bribe people . " in spain to stay back when elhadri was still had a good income , he bought a house in morocco .
last year he married in his home country and had a daughter .
elhadri also has land back in morocco where he would like to start a vineyard , but he says he would need three or four years to establish wine production .
he would consider the project if it did n't mean losing his spanish residency . as it is , elhadri says , neither his unemployment nor his family could convince him to leave his adoptive spanish homeland . author : stephanie eichler -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 23.10.2010 when avant-garde artists made toys , they were n't playing around großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pablo picasso 's refrained from cubist influences with his toy car a conspicuous number of avant-garde artists tried their hand at making toys .
they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .
photo-books by edward steichen or building blocks by joaquin torres garcia are examples of toys that were meant to be mass-produced and developed with pedagogical intentions . " garcia is a good example of an artist who knew the educational theories of the 19th century and wanted to make a company and produce these toys that were very much made with these educational theories in mind , " lebrero stals said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin torres garcia planned to sell his building blocks one of the main discoveries lebrero stals and his co-curator carlos perez , head of exhibitions at the museo valenciano de la ilustracion y la modernidad in valencia , came across was that many of the avant-garde artists were knowledgeable about new pedagogical theories and saw toys as central to education . the avant-garde did n't want to just teach children their abcs and 123s , but rather lay the foundation for building utopian ideals .
within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia . " connecting with children though the exhibit focuses on the artistry and functional relationship between toys and education , there also is an emotional element that ca n't be overlooked , said gary cross , a professor of modern history at penn state who specializes in work and leisure in the 20th century . there were really two different themes in early 20th-century toys , and while some toys were aimed at education and preparing children for the modern world , others focused on the preservation of childhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul klee 's doll was created shortly after the end of world war i cross said there were a number of different groups at the beginning of 20th century interested in connecting to the child .
one of them was the so-called puppen reform movement , " which was about making dolls much more child-like , so as to produce emotions in children that were more innocent , instead of getting the child to adopt adult values , " he said . while the picasso museum hopes to interest children in art with this exhibition , as lebrero stals said , the exhibition will inevitably bring visitors closer to the child 's perspective . " parents and artists sometimes seek inspiration from children because the assumption is that children have an innocence and fresh modern view of the world , " said cross . author : sylvia smith -lrb- rf -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .
photo-books by edward steichen or building blocks by joaquin torres garcia are examples of toys that were meant to be mass-produced and developed with pedagogical intentions . " garcia is a good example of an artist who knew the educational theories of the 19th century and wanted to make a company and produce these toys that were very much made with these educational theories in mind , " lebrero stals said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin torres garcia planned to sell his building blocks one of the main discoveries lebrero stals and his co-curator carlos perez , head of exhibitions at the museo valenciano de la ilustracion y la modernidad in valencia , came across was that many of the avant-garde artists were knowledgeable about new pedagogical theories and saw toys as central to education . the avant-garde did n't want to just teach children their abcs and 123s , but rather lay the foundation for building utopian ideals .
within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.10.2010 in big imf revamp , europe to lose influence to emerging economies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 leaders are meeting ahead of a summit in three weeks world leaders meeting ahead of a major g20 summit have laid the groundwork for what could be the biggest revamp of the international monetary fund since the body 's creation , giving greater power to developing countries . representatives of the group of 20 leading industrial nations on saturday reached an agreement on how to reform the international monetary fund , decreasing europe 's influence on decision-making and increasing that of developing nations like china and india .
speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .

they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .
photo-books by edward steichen or building blocks by joaquin torres garcia are examples of toys that were meant to be mass-produced and developed with pedagogical intentions . " garcia is a good example of an artist who knew the educational theories of the 19th century and wanted to make a company and produce these toys that were very much made with these educational theories in mind , " lebrero stals said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin torres garcia planned to sell his building blocks one of the main discoveries lebrero stals and his co-curator carlos perez , head of exhibitions at the museo valenciano de la ilustracion y la modernidad in valencia , came across was that many of the avant-garde artists were knowledgeable about new pedagogical theories and saw toys as central to education . the avant-garde did n't want to just teach children their abcs and 123s , but rather lay the foundation for building utopian ideals .
within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia . " connecting with children though the exhibit focuses on the artistry and functional relationship between toys and education , there also is an emotional element that ca n't be overlooked , said gary cross , a professor of modern history at penn state who specializes in work and leisure in the 20th century . there were really two different themes in early 20th-century toys , and while some toys were aimed at education and preparing children for the modern world , others focused on the preservation of childhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul klee 's doll was created shortly after the end of world war i cross said there were a number of different groups at the beginning of 20th century interested in connecting to the child .
one of them was the so-called puppen reform movement , " which was about making dolls much more child-like , so as to produce emotions in children that were more innocent , instead of getting the child to adopt adult values , " he said . while the picasso museum hopes to interest children in art with this exhibition , as lebrero stals said , the exhibition will inevitably bring visitors closer to the child 's perspective .

they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .
photo-books by edward steichen or building blocks by joaquin torres garcia are examples of toys that were meant to be mass-produced and developed with pedagogical intentions . " garcia is a good example of an artist who knew the educational theories of the 19th century and wanted to make a company and produce these toys that were very much made with these educational theories in mind , " lebrero stals said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin torres garcia planned to sell his building blocks one of the main discoveries lebrero stals and his co-curator carlos perez , head of exhibitions at the museo valenciano de la ilustracion y la modernidad in valencia , came across was that many of the avant-garde artists were knowledgeable about new pedagogical theories and saw toys as central to education . the avant-garde did n't want to just teach children their abcs and 123s , but rather lay the foundation for building utopian ideals .
within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia . " connecting with children though the exhibit focuses on the artistry and functional relationship between toys and education , there also is an emotional element that ca n't be overlooked , said gary cross , a professor of modern history at penn state who specializes in work and leisure in the 20th century . there were really two different themes in early 20th-century toys , and while some toys were aimed at education and preparing children for the modern world , others focused on the preservation of childhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul klee 's doll was created shortly after the end of world war i cross said there were a number of different groups at the beginning of 20th century interested in connecting to the child .
one of them was the so-called puppen reform movement , " which was about making dolls much more child-like , so as to produce emotions in children that were more innocent , instead of getting the child to adopt adult values , " he said . while the picasso museum hopes to interest children in art with this exhibition , as lebrero stals said , the exhibition will inevitably bring visitors closer to the child 's perspective . " parents and artists sometimes seek inspiration from children because the assumption is that children have an innocence and fresh modern view of the world , " said cross . author : sylvia smith -lrb- rf -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the waste is set to flow into germany from france starting next month . thousands of people in germany gathered saturday in protest against a plan that would see high-level radioactive atomic waste transported through their hometowns .
organizers report that nearly 20,000 people demonstrated in some 120 towns and cities located along the planned transport routes , from the southwestern city of karlsruhe to the tiny town of gorleben in the german state of lower saxony .
tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .
transport of the waste in so-called dry-cask , or " castor , " containers is planned to begin in early november from a reprocessing plant in the french city la hague .
but activists want those plans stopped .
on saturday , the north-central city of hanover alone saw some 3,000 protestors , according to organizers .
police there spoke of 1,500 demonstrators .

speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.10.2010 in big imf revamp , europe to lose influence to emerging economies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 leaders are meeting ahead of a summit in three weeks world leaders meeting ahead of a major g20 summit have laid the groundwork for what could be the biggest revamp of the international monetary fund since the body 's creation , giving greater power to developing countries . representatives of the group of 20 leading industrial nations on saturday reached an agreement on how to reform the international monetary fund , decreasing europe 's influence on decision-making and increasing that of developing nations like china and india .
speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .

tiny town the center of national debate gorleben , with a population of around 600 , is set to become the location of an interim storage facility for radioactive atomic waste .

police there spoke of 1,500 demonstrators .
in the city of greifswald some 30 protestors rolled barrels through the city , shouting , " we 'll bring you the waste . "
meanwhile , streets in the northern cities of bremen and rostock were overtaken by demonstrators on bicycles .
bildunterschrift : protestors in juelich went to the local tracks to draw awareness bigger protests ahead a spokesperson for the anti-atomic initiative " ausgestrahlt " said saturday 's protests were a mere prelude to the demonstration planned for november 6 in the town of dannenberg , where he expected tens of thousands of protestors to participate .
the european commission meanwhile plans to increase pressure on eu member states to find a permanent solution to the problem of atomic waste storage .
guenther oettinger , european commissioner for energy , told munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung in an interview published saturday that he plans to propose new eu guidelines for disposing nuclear waste on november 3 .

but many immigrants are loath to leave their adopted home . south american and african immigrants in spain increasingly find themselves caught in a tough predicament .
unable to gain long-term employment in their host country , they see no attractive prospects back at home , either . despite high unemployment , many of these immigrants choose to remain in their host nations rather than return to their countries of origin . among them is moroccan immigrant ali elhadri , a construction worker who has found himself a victim of the collapse of spain 's construction industry . dashed hopes the 34-year-old moroccan had a much different vision of his future when he risked his life 12 years ago to come to europe in a boat which he described as " a little nutshell . " " there were 25 of us , and the boat was only five or six meters -lrb- 16-20 feet -rrb- long , " he told deutsche welle .
" we were practically stacked one on top of the other . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled labor positions in spain have gotten harder to come by elhadri said he and his fellow passengers came " with the illusion that we would find the land of our dreams .
but what awaited us was a harsh reality . " elhadri arrived at the time of spain 's construction boom and at first had no trouble finding work .
he soon received permanent residency status .
however , in the wake of the global financial crisis a decade later , many of spain 's construction companies have gone out of business . now jobless , elhadri can no longer count on state benefits .
a few weeks ago he stopped receiving unemployment benefits . he currently works on odd jobs , such as helping out friends with renovations . better jobless in spain than gone for good in the face of high unemployment rates among immigrants , spain came up with an initiative in 2008 to support jobless , non-eu citizens who want to return to their countries of origin .
in these cases , the government offers a one-time payout of immigrants ' full unemployment benefits . usually , the lump sum amounts to about 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,000 -rrb- .
however , the initiative has been far less popular than the government had expected .
only 1,400 immigrants took up the government ’ s offer in the program ’ s first two months . a likely reason is that immigrants who choose this option must give up their right to live in spain . " many immigrants leave feeling they 've failed , " said rocio redondo of spain 's red cross .
" of course they are thankful for the financial aid , but almost all of them have difficulty giving up their spanish papers . " redondo is in contact with many immigrants who would like to return to their countries of origin for a certain period , but said most give up their plans when they learn that they will not be allowed to return to spain .
it is difficult for people who are n't from europe to get a spanish visa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elhadri 's friend said is also unemployed but would rather try his luck in france than return to morocco hanging in sometimes elhadri and his friends toy with the notion of returning to morocco , where the construction industry is expanding and laborers are in demand .
yet elhadri is loath to take this option , saying he would have to accept wages of about six euros a day - the cost of a kilogram of meat . he also does not want to give up the freedoms he enjoys in spain .
elhadri said he has grown quite liberal in spain and can not imagine living in morocco , where he says religion pervades daily life . " life here in spain is good .
in terms of politics , there 's democracy , ” he said .
“ your rights are protected . "
that 's quite different from morocco , where he says corruption still rules . " even when you need something that you have a right to - like papers from a government office - you have to bribe people . " in spain to stay back when elhadri was still had a good income , he bought a house in morocco .
last year he married in his home country and had a daughter .
elhadri also has land back in morocco where he would like to start a vineyard , but he says he would need three or four years to establish wine production .
he would consider the project if it did n't mean losing his spanish residency . as it is , elhadri says , neither his unemployment nor his family could convince him to leave his adoptive spanish homeland . author : stephanie eichler -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for more than a week people in naples have burned cars and italian flags and have thrown stones and firecrackers at police to protest the stench and poor conditions of their local landfill , as well as plans to build a new one in vesuvio national park .
clashes continued through friday night but had subsided on saturday .
the european court of justice found last march that italy 's failure to clean up naples ' streets was in violation of eu legislation .
if the european commission refers the matter back to the court , and if italy is found to still be in breach of the law , it could face millions of euros in fines .

they were n't just looking for cheap christmas gifts , but were connecting with childhood and utopian desires , according to a new exhibition . when pablo picasso carves a toy horse for his grandson , it may not be a significant artistic event .
but when hundreds of artists working within the same movement turn their attention to making toys , it 's time to take note . " we saw and knew that the issue of the toys was somehow important for some relevant artists of the avant-garde and it had n't been done as an exhibition before , " said jose lebrero stals , art director at malaga 's picasso museum , which is currently featuring an exhibition called toys of the avant-garde . the exhibition features nearly 600 objects by more than 200 artists - including that wooden toy horse by pablo picasso , but also puppets by paul klee and oskar schlemmer , and a traveling circus orchestrated by alexander calder . in these cases , the toys were never intended to grace a museum case , but were created for everyday use by the artists ' own children or grandchildren . yet even in these instances , the artists-turned-toy-makers do n't depart from their avant-garde mindset , said ara h. merjian , assistant professor of italian studies and art history at new york university .
the blurring of boundaries between aesthetics and real life was fundamental to the avant-garde movement , she said , so " the toy offers a very useful case study for the relative success and failure at reconciling art and life . " these toys can also be seen as an overflow of the artists ' creative energy into their private lives , lebrero stals added .
" it 's normal , i think , that an artist would make creative objects for their children , too . " toys to teach not all of the objects in the exhibition were only made for personal use .
photo-books by edward steichen or building blocks by joaquin torres garcia are examples of toys that were meant to be mass-produced and developed with pedagogical intentions .

within the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century , there were different interpretations of utopia , though they were generally bound by a common desire to break away from the rules , structures , and failings of the previous generation . " because youth and children obviously represented a new generation , their potential as a new citizenry was in line with some of the utopian aspects of the avant-garde between the world wars , especially after the devastation in world war i , " merjian said .
" they were using the avant-garde to change the material and spiritual life , and children in some ways stood as the primary vehicle of that utopia . " connecting with children though the exhibit focuses on the artistry and functional relationship between toys and education , there also is an emotional element that ca n't be overlooked , said gary cross , a professor of modern history at penn state who specializes in work and leisure in the 20th century . there were really two different themes in early 20th-century toys , and while some toys were aimed at education and preparing children for the modern world , others focused on the preservation of childhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul klee 's doll was created shortly after the end of world war i cross said there were a number of different groups at the beginning of 20th century interested in connecting to the child .
one of them was the so-called puppen reform movement , " which was about making dolls much more child-like , so as to produce emotions in children that were more innocent , instead of getting the child to adopt adult values , " he said . while the picasso museum hopes to interest children in art with this exhibition , as lebrero stals said , the exhibition will inevitably bring visitors closer to the child 's perspective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.10.2010 in big imf revamp , europe to lose influence to emerging economies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g20 leaders are meeting ahead of a summit in three weeks world leaders meeting ahead of a major g20 summit have laid the groundwork for what could be the biggest revamp of the international monetary fund since the body 's creation , giving greater power to developing countries . representatives of the group of 20 leading industrial nations on saturday reached an agreement on how to reform the international monetary fund , decreasing europe 's influence on decision-making and increasing that of developing nations like china and india .
speaking to reporters at the meeting on saturday , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn called the deal a " very historic agreement . "
" this makes for the biggest reform ever in the governance of the institution , " he said .
the agreement came out of meetings of g20 finance ministers and central bankers in gyeongju , south korea , where g20 heads of state are to meet in three weeks .
it would likely go into effect in 2011 .
less power for europe at the heart of the reforms is a substantial change in how the body is governed , shifting more than 6 percent of voting power to fast-developing countries .
europe would also give up two out of the eight or nine seats it controls at any given time on the 24-member executive board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china and india are to have greater influence on decision-making current imf governance largely reflects the geopolitical situation at the time of the body 's founding after world war ii , and it has proven outdated with the rapid rise of economies like china , india , russia and brazil .
under the new agreement , these countries would have greater voting power as well as greater financial obligations and access to imf funds .
the fund 's five biggest members - the united states , japan , germany , france and britain - each control their own seats on the board and are able to appoint their own executive directors .
the reformed structure would require these directors to be elected by the full board .
the united states had sought a greater reduction in europe 's influence on the board , but agreed to the compromise in return for retaining its veto power over the fund 's most important decisions .
the imf functions as a watchdog over the global financial system and intervenes when countries are threatened with the inability to make payments on debt .
its influence has increased since the 2008-2009 global economic crisis , in europe most notably with its joint eu bailout fund for greece .
germany criticizes dollar policy meanwhile after the meeting of g20 financial representatives , german economics minister rainer bruederle offered criticism of the us federal reserve , accusing it of artifically manipulating its exchange rate .
" there was criticism of the american policy of monetary easing , or creating more liquidity , " he said .
" i tried to make clear in my contribution that i regard that as the wrong way to go ...
an excessive , permanent increase in money is , in my view , an indirect manipulation of the -lrb- foreign exchange -rrb- rate . "
us treasury secretary timothy geithner said he backed a " strong dollar " and denied any policy of weaking the currency to boost exports by making american goods cheaper abroad .
