but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests were violent " a relatively small group of people ... came clearly with the intent of damaging property and perpetrating violence , " he said at a news conference .
" they 're criminals that came to toronto deliberately to break the law . "
groups opposed to the g-20 have been demonstrating in toronto leading up to the summit of the world 's rich and emerging economies , which follows a smaller meeting of the world 's eight richest nations which concluded earlier saturday in the northern ontario resort town of huntsville .
curb deficits , boost growth in toronto on saturday , world leaders closed in on an agreement to halve their budget deficits within three years and boost economic growth .
in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

miroslav klose and lukas podolski scored the other two goals . the game was marked by slick attacking from germany , while england 's defense looked shaky from the beginning .
germany created an early chance after just four minutes when bastian schweinsteiger put attacking midfielder mesut oezil through for a chance that was blocked by english goalkeeper david james . the first goal came after 20 minutes when miroslav klose took advantage of a goal kick from manuel neuer , holding off defender matthew upson to put the ball past david james . the next goal on 32 minutes came after striker lukas podolski scored from a narrow angle on the left of the box from a pass by mueller . england regained some possession but were unable to take advantage and germany continued to push forward . five minutes later , england defender matthew upson rose to a cross from steven gerrard , heading the ball into an empty net past neuer . denied goal england must have thought the gods were against them on the 38 minute mark , as a shot by frank lampard rebounded off the crossbar and bounced behind the line .
the goal was not given - and television replays showed the ball at least a foot or more behind the line . bildunterschrift : neuer looks at the ball during the goal that england was denied german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . " " it was the most important part of the game , " england coach fabio capello said of the decision .
" we made some mistakes and the referee made one big mistake - but germany played a good game . " there were no more chances in the first half , and the teams took a curious 2-1 into the dressing rooms . the takeover england started the second half a little better and defender arne friedrich was booked early on a foul against england forward jermain defoe . coach fabio capello made a substitution on 64 minutes , bringing on attacking midfielder joe cole for james milner . germany scored on 66 minutes when mueller smashed the ball into the net off david james from a pass by schweinsteiger to make the score 3-1 . bildunterschrift : mueller fired germany to victory only three minutes later , mueller netted the fourth after poor defending from england and a cross from mesut oezil sent him through on goal . the 20-year-old mueller was named fifa man of the match . " two goals in one world cup match does not happen too often , " mueller told the reuters news agency .
" but now i want more .
i want to score five or six goals here . " soon after , there was another substitution by england coach fabio capello as forward emile heskey came on for defoe and german coach joachim loew brought mueller and klose off for piotr trochowski and mario gomez . england continued to attack , maintaining posession for long periods but seemed unable to make the breakthrough against germany 's defense . germany will next play argentina in the quarterfinals on saturday . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "

the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's ' literature houses ' stress reading books over selling them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature houses make reading interactive germany 's first literature house was founded in berlin in 1986 , even before american bookstores started selling cappuccinos .
now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .
" they need to be international and not just invite german-speaking authors or organize local projects .
and , for practical reasons , they have to have a certain budget " that is capable of financially supporting literaturhaus.net. the individual literature houses are funded by private clubs or foundations , by renting out their facilities , or by government contributions .
they 're always on the lookout for new sponsors . despite occasional financial difficulties , the literature house concept has established itself so well that it 's been exported to other european cities , including prague , copenhagen and oslo .
in prague and copenhagen , the houses are even identified by the german word .. " that really speaks for the label ' literaturhaus ' that has developed over the past 20 to 25 years , " said moritz . he said that the word literaturhaus did not exist in germany 's definitive dictionary , duden , until he campaigned to have it added .
it first appeared in the 2007 edition . author : heide soltau -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miroslav klose and lukas podolski scored the other two goals . the game was marked by slick attacking from germany , while england 's defense looked shaky from the beginning .
germany created an early chance after just four minutes when bastian schweinsteiger put attacking midfielder mesut oezil through for a chance that was blocked by english goalkeeper david james . the first goal came after 20 minutes when miroslav klose took advantage of a goal kick from manuel neuer , holding off defender matthew upson to put the ball past david james . the next goal on 32 minutes came after striker lukas podolski scored from a narrow angle on the left of the box from a pass by mueller . england regained some possession but were unable to take advantage and germany continued to push forward . five minutes later , england defender matthew upson rose to a cross from steven gerrard , heading the ball into an empty net past neuer . denied goal england must have thought the gods were against them on the 38 minute mark , as a shot by frank lampard rebounded off the crossbar and bounced behind the line .

" we made some mistakes and the referee made one big mistake - but germany played a good game . " there were no more chances in the first half , and the teams took a curious 2-1 into the dressing rooms . the takeover england started the second half a little better and defender arne friedrich was booked early on a foul against england forward jermain defoe . coach fabio capello made a substitution on 64 minutes , bringing on attacking midfielder joe cole for james milner . germany scored on 66 minutes when mueller smashed the ball into the net off david james from a pass by schweinsteiger to make the score 3-1 . bildunterschrift : mueller fired germany to victory only three minutes later , mueller netted the fourth after poor defending from england and a cross from mesut oezil sent him through on goal . the 20-year-old mueller was named fifa man of the match .

" but now i want more .

" soon after , there was another substitution by england coach fabio capello as forward emile heskey came on for defoe and german coach joachim loew brought mueller and klose off for piotr trochowski and mario gomez . england continued to attack , maintaining posession for long periods but seemed unable to make the breakthrough against germany 's defense . germany will next play argentina in the quarterfinals on saturday . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it landed upside down , before sliding into the tire wall .
webber was able to walk away from the wreckage . bad weekend for mercedes nine drivers were given five-second penalties after the race , a decision which moved birthday-boy nico rosberg up from 12th to 10th . however , his mercedes teammate michael schumacher was not in such a festive mood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's ' literature houses ' stress reading books over selling them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature houses make reading interactive germany 's first literature house was founded in berlin in 1986 , even before american bookstores started selling cappuccinos .
now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .
" they need to be international and not just invite german-speaking authors or organize local projects .
and , for practical reasons , they have to have a certain budget " that is capable of financially supporting literaturhaus.net. the individual literature houses are funded by private clubs or foundations , by renting out their facilities , or by government contributions .
they 're always on the lookout for new sponsors . despite occasional financial difficulties , the literature house concept has established itself so well that it 's been exported to other european cities , including prague , copenhagen and oslo .
in prague and copenhagen , the houses are even identified by the german word .. " that really speaks for the label ' literaturhaus ' that has developed over the past 20 to 25 years , " said moritz . he said that the word literaturhaus did not exist in germany 's definitive dictionary , duden , until he campaigned to have it added .
it first appeared in the 2007 edition . author : heide soltau -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests were violent " a relatively small group of people ... came clearly with the intent of damaging property and perpetrating violence , " he said at a news conference .
" they 're criminals that came to toronto deliberately to break the law . "
groups opposed to the g-20 have been demonstrating in toronto leading up to the summit of the world 's rich and emerging economies , which follows a smaller meeting of the world 's eight richest nations which concluded earlier saturday in the northern ontario resort town of huntsville .
curb deficits , boost growth in toronto on saturday , world leaders closed in on an agreement to halve their budget deficits within three years and boost economic growth .
in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope . " i find it impressive that a country like germany , with its history , has become such a multicultural country that players such as mesut oezil can be celebrated as a national hero , " she said . pinto added that believes the team is capable of winning the world cup . " i honestly do think they can win it , " she said .
" they are young and they still want to play football . " even if it comes to a showdown between germany and portugal , where her family 's roots are , she 'll simply have it both ways . " i support both of them .
in previous tournaments they have both done well and i can be happy for both . " football , not politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil , germany 's new hope ?
one fan of portuguese descent thinks so hassan ado , who was born in syria and who has been in germany for 15 years , is also supporting germany . " whoever plays well should play in the team , whether they have an immigrant background or not , " said hassan , 42 . " it is about football and should n't be about politics . " that may be true , but politicians have addressed the diversity of the national side publicly .

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests were violent " a relatively small group of people ... came clearly with the intent of damaging property and perpetrating violence , " he said at a news conference .

in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

" two goals in one world cup match does not happen too often , " mueller told the reuters news agency .
" but now i want more .
i want to score five or six goals here . " soon after , there was another substitution by england coach fabio capello as forward emile heskey came on for defoe and german coach joachim loew brought mueller and klose off for piotr trochowski and mario gomez . england continued to attack , maintaining posession for long periods but seemed unable to make the breakthrough against germany 's defense . germany will next play argentina in the quarterfinals on saturday . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .

at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .

now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .
" they need to be international and not just invite german-speaking authors or organize local projects .
and , for practical reasons , they have to have a certain budget " that is capable of financially supporting literaturhaus.net. the individual literature houses are funded by private clubs or foundations , by renting out their facilities , or by government contributions .
they 're always on the lookout for new sponsors . despite occasional financial difficulties , the literature house concept has established itself so well that it 's been exported to other european cities , including prague , copenhagen and oslo .
in prague and copenhagen , the houses are even identified by the german word .. " that really speaks for the label ' literaturhaus ' that has developed over the past 20 to 25 years , " said moritz . he said that the word literaturhaus did not exist in germany 's definitive dictionary , duden , until he campaigned to have it added .
it first appeared in the 2007 edition . author : heide soltau -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .

while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .

there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .
they piled on the pressure and it paid off when hernandez scored on 71 minutes , soon after argentine playmaker juan sebastian veron had replaced goalscorer tevez . bildunterschrift : javier hernandez gave mexico some hope on 71 minutes messi failed to fully produce and mexico did not give up , with salcido taking several shots from distance .
the mexicans were unable to make a breakthrough and the game finished 3-1 .
before the game , argentina had an almost full-strength line-up .
maxi rodriguez , who scored the winner between the sides at the last world cup was chosen by argentina coach diego maradona in midfield in place of veron .
nicolas burdisso replaced injured center back walter samuel .
argentina will now play germany in the quarter finals after joachim loew 's men beat england 4-1 earlier on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's ' literature houses ' stress reading books over selling them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature houses make reading interactive germany 's first literature house was founded in berlin in 1986 , even before american bookstores started selling cappuccinos .
now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .
" they need to be international and not just invite german-speaking authors or organize local projects .
and , for practical reasons , they have to have a certain budget " that is capable of financially supporting literaturhaus.net. the individual literature houses are funded by private clubs or foundations , by renting out their facilities , or by government contributions .
they 're always on the lookout for new sponsors . despite occasional financial difficulties , the literature house concept has established itself so well that it 's been exported to other european cities , including prague , copenhagen and oslo .
in prague and copenhagen , the houses are even identified by the german word .. " that really speaks for the label ' literaturhaus ' that has developed over the past 20 to 25 years , " said moritz . he said that the word literaturhaus did not exist in germany 's definitive dictionary , duden , until he campaigned to have it added .
it first appeared in the 2007 edition . author : heide soltau -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was a weekend to forget for michael schumacher and his mercedes team . sebastian vettel led from start to finish in a race notable for his red bull teammate mark webber 's massive crash . vettel snatched pole position from webber by less than a tenth of a second on saturday and , once he had negotiated the first lap , enjoyed a comfortable drive to the checkered flag . lewis hamilton 's mclaren swept past webber and into second spot from the start and made contact with vettel 's car as he challenged the german at the second corner . hamilton let vettel know he was not far behind him for most of the afternoon , before being given a drive-through penalty for overtaking the safety car as it came out of the pit lane .
he kept second spot though , ahead of mclaren teammate jenson button . hamilton also leads his fellow briton at the top of the drivers ' championship .
twenty-five points for this afternoon 's victory moves vettel up to third , 12 points off the summit . big smash " it 's about time i won from pole .
we 're back on track , " vettel said after the race .
" it 's good to get a lot of points , good for the championship , so i 'm pleased for today . " " the most important thing is that mark -lsb- webber -rsb- is fine , " added the german .
" i asked on the radio and i am glad he is ok . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : webber was uninjured , showing just how well-built the modern formula one car is webber admitted he had been lucky to come away unscathed from a big accident early in the race .
the australian plummeted from second to ninth on the opening lap , and found himself running behind heikki kovalainen 's considerably slower lotus . webber misinterpreted the finn 's move , apparently thinking he would yield when he was in fact defending his position , and drove into the back of kovalainen .
the impact sent his red bull flying into the air .
it landed upside down , before sliding into the tire wall .
webber was able to walk away from the wreckage . bad weekend for mercedes nine drivers were given five-second penalties after the race , a decision which moved birthday-boy nico rosberg up from 12th to 10th . however , his mercedes teammate michael schumacher was not in such a festive mood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's immigrant communities throw support behind national team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks supported germany in the last world cup the german national team is more ethnically mixed than ever - so too are its fans .
supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope . " i find it impressive that a country like germany , with its history , has become such a multicultural country that players such as mesut oezil can be celebrated as a national hero , " she said . pinto added that believes the team is capable of winning the world cup . " i honestly do think they can win it , " she said .
" they are young and they still want to play football . " even if it comes to a showdown between germany and portugal , where her family 's roots are , she 'll simply have it both ways . " i support both of them .
in previous tournaments they have both done well and i can be happy for both . " football , not politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil , germany 's new hope ?
one fan of portuguese descent thinks so hassan ado , who was born in syria and who has been in germany for 15 years , is also supporting germany . " whoever plays well should play in the team , whether they have an immigrant background or not , " said hassan , 42 . " it is about football and should n't be about politics . " that may be true , but politicians have addressed the diversity of the national side publicly .
both german chancellor angela merkel and presidential candidate christian wulff have claimed the team for this year 's world cup is a model for german integration . germany has had difficulty integrating some of its growing ethnic population .
experts have expressed concern about the existence of " parallel societies " of immigrants who live in germany , or were even born here , but have little to do with the larger society and still largely adhere to ways and attitudes from their countries of origin . but as germany 's team becomes more ethnically diverse , it begins to reflect the changing demographic of the country at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has praised the side 's diversity " there did n't use to be so many foreigners in the german team but now there are many more immigrants in the country as a whole than there were , " said 48-year-old hassan chafik , who came to work in germany from morocco in 1998 and also supports germany in international matches .
" that 's the reason it has changed . " but despite more than a decade in germany , if germany were to play morocco , chafik 's loyalties would be split . " i think i would say morocco , but it 's difficult , " he said . the phenomenon of growing support among germany 's immigrant communities is not a new one .
in 2006 , when germany hosted the world cup , turks living in germany celebrated the home team 's victories along with native germans , especially since the turkish side had failed to qualify for that tournament , nor are they in this one . and with other nations that have large immigrant communities in germany - such as poland and russia - absent at this tournament , there are plenty more potential fans for lahm and co . author : richard connor editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope . " i find it impressive that a country like germany , with its history , has become such a multicultural country that players such as mesut oezil can be celebrated as a national hero , " she said . pinto added that believes the team is capable of winning the world cup . " i honestly do think they can win it , " she said .
" they are young and they still want to play football . " even if it comes to a showdown between germany and portugal , where her family 's roots are , she 'll simply have it both ways . " i support both of them .
in previous tournaments they have both done well and i can be happy for both . " football , not politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil , germany 's new hope ?
one fan of portuguese descent thinks so hassan ado , who was born in syria and who has been in germany for 15 years , is also supporting germany . " whoever plays well should play in the team , whether they have an immigrant background or not , " said hassan , 42 . " it is about football and should n't be about politics . " that may be true , but politicians have addressed the diversity of the national side publicly .
both german chancellor angela merkel and presidential candidate christian wulff have claimed the team for this year 's world cup is a model for german integration . germany has had difficulty integrating some of its growing ethnic population .
experts have expressed concern about the existence of " parallel societies " of immigrants who live in germany , or were even born here , but have little to do with the larger society and still largely adhere to ways and attitudes from their countries of origin . but as germany 's team becomes more ethnically diverse , it begins to reflect the changing demographic of the country at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has praised the side 's diversity " there did n't use to be so many foreigners in the german team but now there are many more immigrants in the country as a whole than there were , " said 48-year-old hassan chafik , who came to work in germany from morocco in 1998 and also supports germany in international matches .
" that 's the reason it has changed . " but despite more than a decade in germany , if germany were to play morocco , chafik 's loyalties would be split . " i think i would say morocco , but it 's difficult , " he said . the phenomenon of growing support among germany 's immigrant communities is not a new one .
in 2006 , when germany hosted the world cup , turks living in germany celebrated the home team 's victories along with native germans , especially since the turkish side had failed to qualify for that tournament , nor are they in this one . and with other nations that have large immigrant communities in germany - such as poland and russia - absent at this tournament , there are plenty more potential fans for lahm and co . author : richard connor editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 27.06.2010 denied england goal prompts outrage and memories of famous final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball clearly bounced over the line behind neuer a disallowed goal for england in germany 's latest world cup match has been widely criticized .
it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's ' literature houses ' stress reading books over selling them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature houses make reading interactive germany 's first literature house was founded in berlin in 1986 , even before american bookstores started selling cappuccinos .
now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .
" they need to be international and not just invite german-speaking authors or organize local projects .
and , for practical reasons , they have to have a certain budget " that is capable of financially supporting literaturhaus.net. the individual literature houses are funded by private clubs or foundations , by renting out their facilities , or by government contributions .
they 're always on the lookout for new sponsors . despite occasional financial difficulties , the literature house concept has established itself so well that it 's been exported to other european cities , including prague , copenhagen and oslo .
in prague and copenhagen , the houses are even identified by the german word .. " that really speaks for the label ' literaturhaus ' that has developed over the past 20 to 25 years , " said moritz . he said that the word literaturhaus did not exist in germany 's definitive dictionary , duden , until he campaigned to have it added .
it first appeared in the 2007 edition . author : heide soltau -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said parliamentary elections were expected to take place in october . " the new constitution has been adopted , despite the savage attacks of its opponents , " otunbayeva told a news conference in the capital bishkek . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva hoped voters would give the green light to her government " we are proud of our people .
we are proud of our country , which made this choice at a difficult hour , " she said .
" the people have put a full stop to the epoch of authoritarian , nepotistic management .
today we reached victory on the path to a true government of the people . " otunbayeva cast her vote early sunday in osh , the city in southern kyrgyzstan that was a center of violent ethnic clashes between the two main ethnic groups - the kyrgyz majority and the uzbek minority - which killed at least 275 people this month , perhaps up to 2,000 . the violence followed a bloody revolt that overthrew former president kurmanbek bakiyev . a simple question voters were asked one simple question : do you approve of a new constitution ?
the charter would transfer power from the president to a new prime minister .
parliamentary elections would be held every five years and the president would be limited to a single six-year term . some 8,000 police officers and an equal number of defense volunteers were enlisted to maintain security and checkpoints were set up throughout the capital and the southern region .
but some observers , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had expressed concern over security during the vote . " our country today is on the brink of great danger , but the results of this referendum will show that the country is united and that the people are one .
it will stand strong on its own feet and move forward , " otunbayeva said after casting her vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in kyrgyzstan as the country voted a vote for stability despite the backdrop of violence , the central election commission said voter turnout was at 69 percent .
over two million people were eligible to vote . " i voted ' yes ' so that the situation gets better , " dlora kazakbayeva , a uzbek woman also voting in osh , told the afp news agency .
" many uzbeks have suffered and several members of my family died .
i am scared but i came to vote . " otunbayeva remained convinced that the divisions in the country would not get in the way of her interim government 's plans for reform . " today the people of kyrgyzstan are voting for stability in the country and the legality of the authorities , " otunbayeva said .
" we will show the world that kyrgyzstan is united . " otunbayeva was previously ambassador to britain and the united states , but she is little known in osh and her control of the volatile region is tenuous . parliamentary elections are set to be held in october , while otunbayeva says she 'll remain in power until 2011 before stepping aside . author : holly fox , richard connor -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the impact sent his red bull flying into the air .
it landed upside down , before sliding into the tire wall .
webber was able to walk away from the wreckage . bad weekend for mercedes nine drivers were given five-second penalties after the race , a decision which moved birthday-boy nico rosberg up from 12th to 10th . however , his mercedes teammate michael schumacher was not in such a festive mood .
the veteran german trailed home in 16th , the lowest position he 'd ever finished a race during his long formula one career .
both cars had suffered from brake problems all weekend . adrian sutil delivered a solid drive to finish sixth for force india .

now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common .

these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's immigrant communities throw support behind national team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks supported germany in the last world cup the german national team is more ethnically mixed than ever - so too are its fans .
supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope . " i find it impressive that a country like germany , with its history , has become such a multicultural country that players such as mesut oezil can be celebrated as a national hero , " she said . pinto added that believes the team is capable of winning the world cup . " i honestly do think they can win it , " she said .
" they are young and they still want to play football . " even if it comes to a showdown between germany and portugal , where her family 's roots are , she 'll simply have it both ways . " i support both of them .
in previous tournaments they have both done well and i can be happy for both . " football , not politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil , germany 's new hope ?
one fan of portuguese descent thinks so hassan ado , who was born in syria and who has been in germany for 15 years , is also supporting germany . " whoever plays well should play in the team , whether they have an immigrant background or not , " said hassan , 42 . " it is about football and should n't be about politics . " that may be true , but politicians have addressed the diversity of the national side publicly .
both german chancellor angela merkel and presidential candidate christian wulff have claimed the team for this year 's world cup is a model for german integration . germany has had difficulty integrating some of its growing ethnic population .
experts have expressed concern about the existence of " parallel societies " of immigrants who live in germany , or were even born here , but have little to do with the larger society and still largely adhere to ways and attitudes from their countries of origin . but as germany 's team becomes more ethnically diverse , it begins to reflect the changing demographic of the country at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has praised the side 's diversity " there did n't use to be so many foreigners in the german team but now there are many more immigrants in the country as a whole than there were , " said 48-year-old hassan chafik , who came to work in germany from morocco in 1998 and also supports germany in international matches .
" that 's the reason it has changed . " but despite more than a decade in germany , if germany were to play morocco , chafik 's loyalties would be split . " i think i would say morocco , but it 's difficult , " he said . the phenomenon of growing support among germany 's immigrant communities is not a new one .
in 2006 , when germany hosted the world cup , turks living in germany celebrated the home team 's victories along with native germans , especially since the turkish side had failed to qualify for that tournament , nor are they in this one . and with other nations that have large immigrant communities in germany - such as poland and russia - absent at this tournament , there are plenty more potential fans for lahm and co . author : richard connor editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .
they piled on the pressure and it paid off when hernandez scored on 71 minutes , soon after argentine playmaker juan sebastian veron had replaced goalscorer tevez . bildunterschrift : javier hernandez gave mexico some hope on 71 minutes messi failed to fully produce and mexico did not give up , with salcido taking several shots from distance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 27.06.2010 denied england goal prompts outrage and memories of famous final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball clearly bounced over the line behind neuer a disallowed goal for england in germany 's latest world cup match has been widely criticized .
it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's immigrant communities throw support behind national team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks supported germany in the last world cup the german national team is more ethnically mixed than ever - so too are its fans .
supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope . " i find it impressive that a country like germany , with its history , has become such a multicultural country that players such as mesut oezil can be celebrated as a national hero , " she said . pinto added that believes the team is capable of winning the world cup . " i honestly do think they can win it , " she said .
" they are young and they still want to play football . " even if it comes to a showdown between germany and portugal , where her family 's roots are , she 'll simply have it both ways . " i support both of them .
in previous tournaments they have both done well and i can be happy for both . " football , not politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil , germany 's new hope ?
one fan of portuguese descent thinks so hassan ado , who was born in syria and who has been in germany for 15 years , is also supporting germany . " whoever plays well should play in the team , whether they have an immigrant background or not , " said hassan , 42 . " it is about football and should n't be about politics . " that may be true , but politicians have addressed the diversity of the national side publicly .
both german chancellor angela merkel and presidential candidate christian wulff have claimed the team for this year 's world cup is a model for german integration . germany has had difficulty integrating some of its growing ethnic population .
experts have expressed concern about the existence of " parallel societies " of immigrants who live in germany , or were even born here , but have little to do with the larger society and still largely adhere to ways and attitudes from their countries of origin . but as germany 's team becomes more ethnically diverse , it begins to reflect the changing demographic of the country at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has praised the side 's diversity " there did n't use to be so many foreigners in the german team but now there are many more immigrants in the country as a whole than there were , " said 48-year-old hassan chafik , who came to work in germany from morocco in 1998 and also supports germany in international matches .
" that 's the reason it has changed . " but despite more than a decade in germany , if germany were to play morocco , chafik 's loyalties would be split . " i think i would say morocco , but it 's difficult , " he said . the phenomenon of growing support among germany 's immigrant communities is not a new one .
in 2006 , when germany hosted the world cup , turks living in germany celebrated the home team 's victories along with native germans , especially since the turkish side had failed to qualify for that tournament , nor are they in this one . and with other nations that have large immigrant communities in germany - such as poland and russia - absent at this tournament , there are plenty more potential fans for lahm and co . author : richard connor editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's ' literature houses ' stress reading books over selling them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature houses make reading interactive germany 's first literature house was founded in berlin in 1986 , even before american bookstores started selling cappuccinos .
now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .

now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .

she said parliamentary elections were expected to take place in october .

" the people have put a full stop to the epoch of authoritarian , nepotistic management .
today we reached victory on the path to a true government of the people . " otunbayeva cast her vote early sunday in osh , the city in southern kyrgyzstan that was a center of violent ethnic clashes between the two main ethnic groups - the kyrgyz majority and the uzbek minority - which killed at least 275 people this month , perhaps up to 2,000 . the violence followed a bloody revolt that overthrew former president kurmanbek bakiyev . a simple question voters were asked one simple question : do you approve of a new constitution ?

today we reached victory on the path to a true government of the people . " otunbayeva cast her vote early sunday in osh , the city in southern kyrgyzstan that was a center of violent ethnic clashes between the two main ethnic groups - the kyrgyz majority and the uzbek minority - which killed at least 275 people this month , perhaps up to 2,000 . the violence followed a bloody revolt that overthrew former president kurmanbek bakiyev . a simple question voters were asked one simple question : do you approve of a new constitution ?

these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .

there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .
they piled on the pressure and it paid off when hernandez scored on 71 minutes , soon after argentine playmaker juan sebastian veron had replaced goalscorer tevez . bildunterschrift : javier hernandez gave mexico some hope on 71 minutes messi failed to fully produce and mexico did not give up , with salcido taking several shots from distance .
the mexicans were unable to make a breakthrough and the game finished 3-1 .
before the game , argentina had an almost full-strength line-up .
maxi rodriguez , who scored the winner between the sides at the last world cup was chosen by argentina coach diego maradona in midfield in place of veron .
nicolas burdisso replaced injured center back walter samuel .
argentina will now play germany in the quarter finals after joachim loew 's men beat england 4-1 earlier on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's immigrant communities throw support behind national team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks supported germany in the last world cup the german national team is more ethnically mixed than ever - so too are its fans .
supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope . " i find it impressive that a country like germany , with its history , has become such a multicultural country that players such as mesut oezil can be celebrated as a national hero , " she said . pinto added that believes the team is capable of winning the world cup . " i honestly do think they can win it , " she said .
" they are young and they still want to play football . " even if it comes to a showdown between germany and portugal , where her family 's roots are , she 'll simply have it both ways . " i support both of them .
in previous tournaments they have both done well and i can be happy for both . " football , not politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil , germany 's new hope ?
one fan of portuguese descent thinks so hassan ado , who was born in syria and who has been in germany for 15 years , is also supporting germany . " whoever plays well should play in the team , whether they have an immigrant background or not , " said hassan , 42 . " it is about football and should n't be about politics . " that may be true , but politicians have addressed the diversity of the national side publicly .
both german chancellor angela merkel and presidential candidate christian wulff have claimed the team for this year 's world cup is a model for german integration . germany has had difficulty integrating some of its growing ethnic population .
experts have expressed concern about the existence of " parallel societies " of immigrants who live in germany , or were even born here , but have little to do with the larger society and still largely adhere to ways and attitudes from their countries of origin . but as germany 's team becomes more ethnically diverse , it begins to reflect the changing demographic of the country at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has praised the side 's diversity " there did n't use to be so many foreigners in the german team but now there are many more immigrants in the country as a whole than there were , " said 48-year-old hassan chafik , who came to work in germany from morocco in 1998 and also supports germany in international matches .
" that 's the reason it has changed . " but despite more than a decade in germany , if germany were to play morocco , chafik 's loyalties would be split . " i think i would say morocco , but it 's difficult , " he said . the phenomenon of growing support among germany 's immigrant communities is not a new one .
in 2006 , when germany hosted the world cup , turks living in germany celebrated the home team 's victories along with native germans , especially since the turkish side had failed to qualify for that tournament , nor are they in this one . and with other nations that have large immigrant communities in germany - such as poland and russia - absent at this tournament , there are plenty more potential fans for lahm and co . author : richard connor editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miroslav klose and lukas podolski scored the other two goals . the game was marked by slick attacking from germany , while england 's defense looked shaky from the beginning .
germany created an early chance after just four minutes when bastian schweinsteiger put attacking midfielder mesut oezil through for a chance that was blocked by english goalkeeper david james . the first goal came after 20 minutes when miroslav klose took advantage of a goal kick from manuel neuer , holding off defender matthew upson to put the ball past david james . the next goal on 32 minutes came after striker lukas podolski scored from a narrow angle on the left of the box from a pass by mueller . england regained some possession but were unable to take advantage and germany continued to push forward . five minutes later , england defender matthew upson rose to a cross from steven gerrard , heading the ball into an empty net past neuer . denied goal england must have thought the gods were against them on the 38 minute mark , as a shot by frank lampard rebounded off the crossbar and bounced behind the line .
the goal was not given - and television replays showed the ball at least a foot or more behind the line . bildunterschrift : neuer looks at the ball during the goal that england was denied german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal .

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .
they piled on the pressure and it paid off when hernandez scored on 71 minutes , soon after argentine playmaker juan sebastian veron had replaced goalscorer tevez . bildunterschrift : javier hernandez gave mexico some hope on 71 minutes messi failed to fully produce and mexico did not give up , with salcido taking several shots from distance .
the mexicans were unable to make a breakthrough and the game finished 3-1 .
before the game , argentina had an almost full-strength line-up .
maxi rodriguez , who scored the winner between the sides at the last world cup was chosen by argentina coach diego maradona in midfield in place of veron .
nicolas burdisso replaced injured center back walter samuel .
argentina will now play germany in the quarter finals after joachim loew 's men beat england 4-1 earlier on sunday .

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests were violent " a relatively small group of people ... came clearly with the intent of damaging property and perpetrating violence , " he said at a news conference .
" they 're criminals that came to toronto deliberately to break the law . "
groups opposed to the g-20 have been demonstrating in toronto leading up to the summit of the world 's rich and emerging economies , which follows a smaller meeting of the world 's eight richest nations which concluded earlier saturday in the northern ontario resort town of huntsville .
curb deficits , boost growth in toronto on saturday , world leaders closed in on an agreement to halve their budget deficits within three years and boost economic growth .
in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 27.06.2010 denied england goal prompts outrage and memories of famous final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball clearly bounced over the line behind neuer a disallowed goal for england in germany 's latest world cup match has been widely criticized .
it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .
they piled on the pressure and it paid off when hernandez scored on 71 minutes , soon after argentine playmaker juan sebastian veron had replaced goalscorer tevez . bildunterschrift : javier hernandez gave mexico some hope on 71 minutes messi failed to fully produce and mexico did not give up , with salcido taking several shots from distance .
the mexicans were unable to make a breakthrough and the game finished 3-1 .
before the game , argentina had an almost full-strength line-up .
maxi rodriguez , who scored the winner between the sides at the last world cup was chosen by argentina coach diego maradona in midfield in place of veron .
nicolas burdisso replaced injured center back walter samuel .
argentina will now play germany in the quarter finals after joachim loew 's men beat england 4-1 earlier on sunday .

now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .
" they need to be international and not just invite german-speaking authors or organize local projects .
and , for practical reasons , they have to have a certain budget " that is capable of financially supporting literaturhaus.net. the individual literature houses are funded by private clubs or foundations , by renting out their facilities , or by government contributions .
they 're always on the lookout for new sponsors . despite occasional financial difficulties , the literature house concept has established itself so well that it 's been exported to other european cities , including prague , copenhagen and oslo .
in prague and copenhagen , the houses are even identified by the german word .. " that really speaks for the label ' literaturhaus ' that has developed over the past 20 to 25 years , " said moritz . he said that the word literaturhaus did not exist in germany 's definitive dictionary , duden , until he campaigned to have it added .
it first appeared in the 2007 edition . author : heide soltau -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope .

experts have expressed concern about the existence of " parallel societies " of immigrants who live in germany , or were even born here , but have little to do with the larger society and still largely adhere to ways and attitudes from their countries of origin . but as germany 's team becomes more ethnically diverse , it begins to reflect the changing demographic of the country at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has praised the side 's diversity " there did n't use to be so many foreigners in the german team but now there are many more immigrants in the country as a whole than there were , " said 48-year-old hassan chafik , who came to work in germany from morocco in 1998 and also supports germany in international matches .

miroslav klose and lukas podolski scored the other two goals . the game was marked by slick attacking from germany , while england 's defense looked shaky from the beginning .
germany created an early chance after just four minutes when bastian schweinsteiger put attacking midfielder mesut oezil through for a chance that was blocked by english goalkeeper david james . the first goal came after 20 minutes when miroslav klose took advantage of a goal kick from manuel neuer , holding off defender matthew upson to put the ball past david james . the next goal on 32 minutes came after striker lukas podolski scored from a narrow angle on the left of the box from a pass by mueller . england regained some possession but were unable to take advantage and germany continued to push forward . five minutes later , england defender matthew upson rose to a cross from steven gerrard , heading the ball into an empty net past neuer . denied goal england must have thought the gods were against them on the 38 minute mark , as a shot by frank lampard rebounded off the crossbar and bounced behind the line .
the goal was not given - and television replays showed the ball at least a foot or more behind the line . bildunterschrift : neuer looks at the ball during the goal that england was denied german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . " " it was the most important part of the game , " england coach fabio capello said of the decision .
" we made some mistakes and the referee made one big mistake - but germany played a good game . " there were no more chances in the first half , and the teams took a curious 2-1 into the dressing rooms . the takeover england started the second half a little better and defender arne friedrich was booked early on a foul against england forward jermain defoe . coach fabio capello made a substitution on 64 minutes , bringing on attacking midfielder joe cole for james milner . germany scored on 66 minutes when mueller smashed the ball into the net off david james from a pass by schweinsteiger to make the score 3-1 . bildunterschrift : mueller fired germany to victory only three minutes later , mueller netted the fourth after poor defending from england and a cross from mesut oezil sent him through on goal . the 20-year-old mueller was named fifa man of the match . " two goals in one world cup match does not happen too often , " mueller told the reuters news agency .
" but now i want more .
i want to score five or six goals here . " soon after , there was another substitution by england coach fabio capello as forward emile heskey came on for defoe and german coach joachim loew brought mueller and klose off for piotr trochowski and mario gomez . england continued to attack , maintaining posession for long periods but seemed unable to make the breakthrough against germany 's defense . germany will next play argentina in the quarterfinals on saturday . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miroslav klose and lukas podolski scored the other two goals . the game was marked by slick attacking from germany , while england 's defense looked shaky from the beginning .
germany created an early chance after just four minutes when bastian schweinsteiger put attacking midfielder mesut oezil through for a chance that was blocked by english goalkeeper david james . the first goal came after 20 minutes when miroslav klose took advantage of a goal kick from manuel neuer , holding off defender matthew upson to put the ball past david james . the next goal on 32 minutes came after striker lukas podolski scored from a narrow angle on the left of the box from a pass by mueller . england regained some possession but were unable to take advantage and germany continued to push forward . five minutes later , england defender matthew upson rose to a cross from steven gerrard , heading the ball into an empty net past neuer . denied goal england must have thought the gods were against them on the 38 minute mark , as a shot by frank lampard rebounded off the crossbar and bounced behind the line .

" there were no more chances in the first half , and the teams took a curious 2-1 into the dressing rooms . the takeover england started the second half a little better and defender arne friedrich was booked early on a foul against england forward jermain defoe . coach fabio capello made a substitution on 64 minutes , bringing on attacking midfielder joe cole for james milner . germany scored on 66 minutes when mueller smashed the ball into the net off david james from a pass by schweinsteiger to make the score 3-1 . bildunterschrift : mueller fired germany to victory only three minutes later , mueller netted the fourth after poor defending from england and a cross from mesut oezil sent him through on goal . the 20-year-old mueller was named fifa man of the match . " two goals in one world cup match does not happen too often , " mueller told the reuters news agency .
" but now i want more .
i want to score five or six goals here . " soon after , there was another substitution by england coach fabio capello as forward emile heskey came on for defoe and german coach joachim loew brought mueller and klose off for piotr trochowski and mario gomez . england continued to attack , maintaining posession for long periods but seemed unable to make the breakthrough against germany 's defense . germany will next play argentina in the quarterfinals on saturday . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 27.06.2010 denied england goal prompts outrage and memories of famous final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball clearly bounced over the line behind neuer a disallowed goal for england in germany 's latest world cup match has been widely criticized .
it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests were violent " a relatively small group of people ... came clearly with the intent of damaging property and perpetrating violence , " he said at a news conference .
" they 're criminals that came to toronto deliberately to break the law . "
groups opposed to the g-20 have been demonstrating in toronto leading up to the summit of the world 's rich and emerging economies , which follows a smaller meeting of the world 's eight richest nations which concluded earlier saturday in the northern ontario resort town of huntsville .
curb deficits , boost growth in toronto on saturday , world leaders closed in on an agreement to halve their budget deficits within three years and boost economic growth .
in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .
they piled on the pressure and it paid off when hernandez scored on 71 minutes , soon after argentine playmaker juan sebastian veron had replaced goalscorer tevez . bildunterschrift : javier hernandez gave mexico some hope on 71 minutes messi failed to fully produce and mexico did not give up , with salcido taking several shots from distance .
the mexicans were unable to make a breakthrough and the game finished 3-1 .
before the game , argentina had an almost full-strength line-up .
maxi rodriguez , who scored the winner between the sides at the last world cup was chosen by argentina coach diego maradona in midfield in place of veron .
nicolas burdisso replaced injured center back walter samuel .
argentina will now play germany in the quarter finals after joachim loew 's men beat england 4-1 earlier on sunday .

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .

" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .

he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .

as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .
they piled on the pressure and it paid off when hernandez scored on 71 minutes , soon after argentine playmaker juan sebastian veron had replaced goalscorer tevez . bildunterschrift : javier hernandez gave mexico some hope on 71 minutes messi failed to fully produce and mexico did not give up , with salcido taking several shots from distance .
the mexicans were unable to make a breakthrough and the game finished 3-1 .
before the game , argentina had an almost full-strength line-up .
maxi rodriguez , who scored the winner between the sides at the last world cup was chosen by argentina coach diego maradona in midfield in place of veron .
nicolas burdisso replaced injured center back walter samuel .
argentina will now play germany in the quarter finals after joachim loew 's men beat england 4-1 earlier on sunday .

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .
they piled on the pressure and it paid off when hernandez scored on 71 minutes , soon after argentine playmaker juan sebastian veron had replaced goalscorer tevez . bildunterschrift : javier hernandez gave mexico some hope on 71 minutes messi failed to fully produce and mexico did not give up , with salcido taking several shots from distance .
the mexicans were unable to make a breakthrough and the game finished 3-1 .
before the game , argentina had an almost full-strength line-up .
maxi rodriguez , who scored the winner between the sides at the last world cup was chosen by argentina coach diego maradona in midfield in place of veron .
nicolas burdisso replaced injured center back walter samuel .
argentina will now play germany in the quarter finals after joachim loew 's men beat england 4-1 earlier on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's ' literature houses ' stress reading books over selling them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature houses make reading interactive germany 's first literature house was founded in berlin in 1986 , even before american bookstores started selling cappuccinos .
now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .
" they need to be international and not just invite german-speaking authors or organize local projects .
and , for practical reasons , they have to have a certain budget " that is capable of financially supporting literaturhaus.net. the individual literature houses are funded by private clubs or foundations , by renting out their facilities , or by government contributions .
they 're always on the lookout for new sponsors . despite occasional financial difficulties , the literature house concept has established itself so well that it 's been exported to other european cities , including prague , copenhagen and oslo .
in prague and copenhagen , the houses are even identified by the german word .. " that really speaks for the label ' literaturhaus ' that has developed over the past 20 to 25 years , " said moritz . he said that the word literaturhaus did not exist in germany 's definitive dictionary , duden , until he campaigned to have it added .

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .

she said parliamentary elections were expected to take place in october . " the new constitution has been adopted , despite the savage attacks of its opponents , " otunbayeva told a news conference in the capital bishkek . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva hoped voters would give the green light to her government " we are proud of our people .
we are proud of our country , which made this choice at a difficult hour , " she said .
" the people have put a full stop to the epoch of authoritarian , nepotistic management .
today we reached victory on the path to a true government of the people . " otunbayeva cast her vote early sunday in osh , the city in southern kyrgyzstan that was a center of violent ethnic clashes between the two main ethnic groups - the kyrgyz majority and the uzbek minority - which killed at least 275 people this month , perhaps up to 2,000 . the violence followed a bloody revolt that overthrew former president kurmanbek bakiyev . a simple question voters were asked one simple question : do you approve of a new constitution ?
the charter would transfer power from the president to a new prime minister .
parliamentary elections would be held every five years and the president would be limited to a single six-year term . some 8,000 police officers and an equal number of defense volunteers were enlisted to maintain security and checkpoints were set up throughout the capital and the southern region .
but some observers , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had expressed concern over security during the vote . " our country today is on the brink of great danger , but the results of this referendum will show that the country is united and that the people are one .
it will stand strong on its own feet and move forward , " otunbayeva said after casting her vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in kyrgyzstan as the country voted a vote for stability despite the backdrop of violence , the central election commission said voter turnout was at 69 percent .
over two million people were eligible to vote . " i voted ' yes ' so that the situation gets better , " dlora kazakbayeva , a uzbek woman also voting in osh , told the afp news agency .
" many uzbeks have suffered and several members of my family died .
i am scared but i came to vote . " otunbayeva remained convinced that the divisions in the country would not get in the way of her interim government 's plans for reform . " today the people of kyrgyzstan are voting for stability in the country and the legality of the authorities , " otunbayeva said .
" we will show the world that kyrgyzstan is united . " otunbayeva was previously ambassador to britain and the united states , but she is little known in osh and her control of the volatile region is tenuous . parliamentary elections are set to be held in october , while otunbayeva says she 'll remain in power until 2011 before stepping aside . author : holly fox , richard connor -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests were violent " a relatively small group of people ... came clearly with the intent of damaging property and perpetrating violence , " he said at a news conference .
" they 're criminals that came to toronto deliberately to break the law . "
groups opposed to the g-20 have been demonstrating in toronto leading up to the summit of the world 's rich and emerging economies , which follows a smaller meeting of the world 's eight richest nations which concluded earlier saturday in the northern ontario resort town of huntsville .
curb deficits , boost growth in toronto on saturday , world leaders closed in on an agreement to halve their budget deficits within three years and boost economic growth .
in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

" but now i want more .
i want to score five or six goals here . " soon after , there was another substitution by england coach fabio capello as forward emile heskey came on for defoe and german coach joachim loew brought mueller and klose off for piotr trochowski and mario gomez . england continued to attack , maintaining posession for long periods but seemed unable to make the breakthrough against germany 's defense . germany will next play argentina in the quarterfinals on saturday . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's immigrant communities throw support behind national team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks supported germany in the last world cup the german national team is more ethnically mixed than ever - so too are its fans .
supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope . " i find it impressive that a country like germany , with its history , has become such a multicultural country that players such as mesut oezil can be celebrated as a national hero , " she said . pinto added that believes the team is capable of winning the world cup . " i honestly do think they can win it , " she said .
" they are young and they still want to play football . " even if it comes to a showdown between germany and portugal , where her family 's roots are , she 'll simply have it both ways . " i support both of them .
in previous tournaments they have both done well and i can be happy for both . " football , not politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil , germany 's new hope ?
one fan of portuguese descent thinks so hassan ado , who was born in syria and who has been in germany for 15 years , is also supporting germany . " whoever plays well should play in the team , whether they have an immigrant background or not , " said hassan , 42 . " it is about football and should n't be about politics . " that may be true , but politicians have addressed the diversity of the national side publicly .
both german chancellor angela merkel and presidential candidate christian wulff have claimed the team for this year 's world cup is a model for german integration . germany has had difficulty integrating some of its growing ethnic population .
experts have expressed concern about the existence of " parallel societies " of immigrants who live in germany , or were even born here , but have little to do with the larger society and still largely adhere to ways and attitudes from their countries of origin . but as germany 's team becomes more ethnically diverse , it begins to reflect the changing demographic of the country at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has praised the side 's diversity " there did n't use to be so many foreigners in the german team but now there are many more immigrants in the country as a whole than there were , " said 48-year-old hassan chafik , who came to work in germany from morocco in 1998 and also supports germany in international matches .
" that 's the reason it has changed . " but despite more than a decade in germany , if germany were to play morocco , chafik 's loyalties would be split . " i think i would say morocco , but it 's difficult , " he said . the phenomenon of growing support among germany 's immigrant communities is not a new one .
in 2006 , when germany hosted the world cup , turks living in germany celebrated the home team 's victories along with native germans , especially since the turkish side had failed to qualify for that tournament , nor are they in this one . and with other nations that have large immigrant communities in germany - such as poland and russia - absent at this tournament , there are plenty more potential fans for lahm and co . author : richard connor editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together .

" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's immigrant communities throw support behind national team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks supported germany in the last world cup the german national team is more ethnically mixed than ever - so too are its fans .
supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope . " i find it impressive that a country like germany , with its history , has become such a multicultural country that players such as mesut oezil can be celebrated as a national hero , " she said . pinto added that believes the team is capable of winning the world cup . " i honestly do think they can win it , " she said .
" they are young and they still want to play football . " even if it comes to a showdown between germany and portugal , where her family 's roots are , she 'll simply have it both ways . " i support both of them .
in previous tournaments they have both done well and i can be happy for both . " football , not politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil , germany 's new hope ?
one fan of portuguese descent thinks so hassan ado , who was born in syria and who has been in germany for 15 years , is also supporting germany . " whoever plays well should play in the team , whether they have an immigrant background or not , " said hassan , 42 . " it is about football and should n't be about politics . " that may be true , but politicians have addressed the diversity of the national side publicly .
both german chancellor angela merkel and presidential candidate christian wulff have claimed the team for this year 's world cup is a model for german integration . germany has had difficulty integrating some of its growing ethnic population .
experts have expressed concern about the existence of " parallel societies " of immigrants who live in germany , or were even born here , but have little to do with the larger society and still largely adhere to ways and attitudes from their countries of origin . but as germany 's team becomes more ethnically diverse , it begins to reflect the changing demographic of the country at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has praised the side 's diversity " there did n't use to be so many foreigners in the german team but now there are many more immigrants in the country as a whole than there were , " said 48-year-old hassan chafik , who came to work in germany from morocco in 1998 and also supports germany in international matches .
" that 's the reason it has changed . " but despite more than a decade in germany , if germany were to play morocco , chafik 's loyalties would be split . " i think i would say morocco , but it 's difficult , " he said . the phenomenon of growing support among germany 's immigrant communities is not a new one .
in 2006 , when germany hosted the world cup , turks living in germany celebrated the home team 's victories along with native germans , especially since the turkish side had failed to qualify for that tournament , nor are they in this one . and with other nations that have large immigrant communities in germany - such as poland and russia - absent at this tournament , there are plenty more potential fans for lahm and co . author : richard connor editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

she said parliamentary elections were expected to take place in october . " the new constitution has been adopted , despite the savage attacks of its opponents , " otunbayeva told a news conference in the capital bishkek . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva hoped voters would give the green light to her government " we are proud of our people .
we are proud of our country , which made this choice at a difficult hour , " she said .
" the people have put a full stop to the epoch of authoritarian , nepotistic management .
today we reached victory on the path to a true government of the people . " otunbayeva cast her vote early sunday in osh , the city in southern kyrgyzstan that was a center of violent ethnic clashes between the two main ethnic groups - the kyrgyz majority and the uzbek minority - which killed at least 275 people this month , perhaps up to 2,000 . the violence followed a bloody revolt that overthrew former president kurmanbek bakiyev . a simple question voters were asked one simple question : do you approve of a new constitution ?
the charter would transfer power from the president to a new prime minister .
parliamentary elections would be held every five years and the president would be limited to a single six-year term . some 8,000 police officers and an equal number of defense volunteers were enlisted to maintain security and checkpoints were set up throughout the capital and the southern region .
but some observers , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had expressed concern over security during the vote . " our country today is on the brink of great danger , but the results of this referendum will show that the country is united and that the people are one .
it will stand strong on its own feet and move forward , " otunbayeva said after casting her vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in kyrgyzstan as the country voted a vote for stability despite the backdrop of violence , the central election commission said voter turnout was at 69 percent .

" many uzbeks have suffered and several members of my family died .
i am scared but i came to vote . " otunbayeva remained convinced that the divisions in the country would not get in the way of her interim government 's plans for reform . " today the people of kyrgyzstan are voting for stability in the country and the legality of the authorities , " otunbayeva said .
" we will show the world that kyrgyzstan is united . " otunbayeva was previously ambassador to britain and the united states , but she is little known in osh and her control of the volatile region is tenuous . parliamentary elections are set to be held in october , while otunbayeva says she 'll remain in power until 2011 before stepping aside . author : holly fox , richard connor -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests were violent " a relatively small group of people ... came clearly with the intent of damaging property and perpetrating violence , " he said at a news conference .
" they 're criminals that came to toronto deliberately to break the law . "
groups opposed to the g-20 have been demonstrating in toronto leading up to the summit of the world 's rich and emerging economies , which follows a smaller meeting of the world 's eight richest nations which concluded earlier saturday in the northern ontario resort town of huntsville .
curb deficits , boost growth in toronto on saturday , world leaders closed in on an agreement to halve their budget deficits within three years and boost economic growth .
in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests were violent " a relatively small group of people ... came clearly with the intent of damaging property and perpetrating violence , " he said at a news conference .
" they 're criminals that came to toronto deliberately to break the law . "
groups opposed to the g-20 have been demonstrating in toronto leading up to the summit of the world 's rich and emerging economies , which follows a smaller meeting of the world 's eight richest nations which concluded earlier saturday in the northern ontario resort town of huntsville .
curb deficits , boost growth in toronto on saturday , world leaders closed in on an agreement to halve their budget deficits within three years and boost economic growth .
in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's ' literature houses ' stress reading books over selling them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature houses make reading interactive germany 's first literature house was founded in berlin in 1986 , even before american bookstores started selling cappuccinos .
now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .
" they need to be international and not just invite german-speaking authors or organize local projects .
and , for practical reasons , they have to have a certain budget " that is capable of financially supporting literaturhaus.net. the individual literature houses are funded by private clubs or foundations , by renting out their facilities , or by government contributions .
they 're always on the lookout for new sponsors . despite occasional financial difficulties , the literature house concept has established itself so well that it 's been exported to other european cities , including prague , copenhagen and oslo .
in prague and copenhagen , the houses are even identified by the german word .. " that really speaks for the label ' literaturhaus ' that has developed over the past 20 to 25 years , " said moritz . he said that the word literaturhaus did not exist in germany 's definitive dictionary , duden , until he campaigned to have it added .
it first appeared in the 2007 edition . author : heide soltau -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .
mexico put on another striker , with guillermo franco replacing andres guardado .
they piled on the pressure and it paid off when hernandez scored on 71 minutes , soon after argentine playmaker juan sebastian veron had replaced goalscorer tevez . bildunterschrift : javier hernandez gave mexico some hope on 71 minutes messi failed to fully produce and mexico did not give up , with salcido taking several shots from distance .
the mexicans were unable to make a breakthrough and the game finished 3-1 .
before the game , argentina had an almost full-strength line-up .
maxi rodriguez , who scored the winner between the sides at the last world cup was chosen by argentina coach diego maradona in midfield in place of veron .
nicolas burdisso replaced injured center back walter samuel .
argentina will now play germany in the quarter finals after joachim loew 's men beat england 4-1 earlier on sunday .

mexico fought hard , but it will be maradona 's men who go on to play germany in the quarter finals of the competition . argentina had the best of the early possession , but mexico also made some attacking inroads .
there was an early chance for lionel messi , after he was cued up by carlos tevez , while mexico also looked good with a long-range effort from defender carlos salcido and a ball put wide by midfielder andres guardado .
while argentina could maintain possession , they could not capitalize on it initially .
star player lionel messi had space but was quickly closed down .
the first goal for argentina came in the 25th minute , as striker carlos tevez headed in a ball from messi .
the goal stood although it was offside as seen in television replays .
both the mexican and argentine sides crowded around the referee who appeared to waver for a minute as he consulted his assistant .
but in the end , the goal counted .
argentina 's attacks continued and a defensive mistake allowed striker gonzalo higuain to score by rounding keeper oscar perez on 33 minutes .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's gonzalo higuain , left , scored his side 's second goal the score remained 2-0 when the sides left the pitch at half time .
thunderous strike soon after the sides returned , on 52 minutes , it was tevez again who scored with a thunderous strike into the back of the net , despite a strong period for mexico .
tevez had attempted a pass , which was blocked , but was able once again to connect with the ball .

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "

in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .

" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .

" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .

so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .

" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.06.2010 germany 's immigrant communities throw support behind national team großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks supported germany in the last world cup the german national team is more ethnically mixed than ever - so too are its fans .
supporters from many backgrounds are backing the home team as germany progresses through the 2010 fifa world cup . while german team captain philipp lahm and his deputy bastian schweinsteiger hail from bavaria , 11 members of the 23-man world cup 2010 squad have foreign roots . five were born outside germany .
forwards miroslav klose , lukas podolski and piotr trochowski were born in poland , winger marko marin in yugoslavia and striker cacau in brazil . but it 's not just on the football field in south africa that german football 's multicultural side is apparent .
off the pitch , the german team 's fan base is diverse , and you do n't have to be born in germany to support the national side , regulars at one bar in the city of bonn were keen to stress to deutsche welle . nineteen-year-old denise pinto , whose family came from portugal before she was born , has been cheering germany on all her life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football fans denise pinto and hassan chafik are supporting germany while she counts lahm among her favorite players , it 's midfielder mesut oezil , of turkish descent , who she believes is german football 's new hope . " i find it impressive that a country like germany , with its history , has become such a multicultural country that players such as mesut oezil can be celebrated as a national hero , " she said . pinto added that believes the team is capable of winning the world cup . " i honestly do think they can win it , " she said .
" they are young and they still want to play football . " even if it comes to a showdown between germany and portugal , where her family 's roots are , she 'll simply have it both ways . " i support both of them .
in previous tournaments they have both done well and i can be happy for both . " football , not politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil , germany 's new hope ?
one fan of portuguese descent thinks so hassan ado , who was born in syria and who has been in germany for 15 years , is also supporting germany . " whoever plays well should play in the team , whether they have an immigrant background or not , " said hassan , 42 . " it is about football and should n't be about politics .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "
the general consensus among niger delta campaigners is that it will take a concerted international civilian , political and judicial effort to make the oil giants accountable for their mess .
" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .
williams wants much the same thing .
he calls on the international community and the european parliament in particular to sign treaties and declarations enforcing international standards of respectful corporate governance .
" if they can make binding regulations compelling corporations of european and american origin to behave the same way they do in europe irrespective of the strength or weakness of government or how corrupt those governments are , we would see a difference , " williams concluded .

but their stories are rarely heard . the tale of the niger delta is one of two halves .
farmed and fished and otherwise left to nature 's devices , the 70,000-square kilometer -lrb- 27,000 square miles -rrb- area of wetland boasts one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world .
with its intricate network of creeks , rivers , estuaries , mangrove and fresh swamps and abundance of tree and fish species , the ecology of the delta reads like a dream .
but living in it has become a nightmare .
where once it was possible for hungry locals to leave the cooking pot warming while they went outside to catch something to put in it , their waters have now become so contaminated that the fishing industry has all but ceased to be .
and the reason is crude .
quite literally .
oil was discovered in the niger delta in the mid 1950 's and believing it would bring lasting prosperity to the area , the local population celebrated the find .
when the first of the black gold was extracted from deep beneath their feet , it smelled of promise and of a plentiful future .
the pitter patter of acid rain when the region first began to witness signs of environmental change such as an increase in gas levels , the local population attributed it to witchcraft and wizardry .
it was only when people 's roofs started to turn brown with just months of being put up that the first questions surfaced .
as prince chima williams , head of legal resources with the environmental rights action group in the niger delta told deutsche welle , something was not right .
" researchers began to find out that the brownish tone on the roofs was caused by acid rain and people came to realize the dangers inherent in this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken saro-wiwa died for his cause the horrific extent of those dangers was brought to light by the non-violent campaign of writer and environmental activist ken saro-wiwa , who rallied against shell 's degradation of the niger delta 's ogoniland region until his controversial judicial execution in 1995 .
although shell pulled out of ogoniland in 1993 , it and several other major oil companies including exxonmobil and chevron are still very much at large across the delta .
they are collectively responsible for some 10,000 kilometers of pipeline , much of which is aged and rusty and extremely prone to leak .
the number of spills increases by the year - some say to as many as one per day - but the number of clean-ups does not keep pace .
poor spill management in the past , shell , the largest of the petroleum corporations with a presence in the region , has gone on record saying that the majority of spills are a result of sabotage .
although there are certainly incidences of illegal siphoning , that is by no means the whole picture .
nigerian government estimates say there are more than 2,400 spills in the region currently waiting to be cleaned up - some of them having occurred as long as 20 years ago .
but those figures are considered modest by experts and campaigners such as ben amunwa of london-based platform 's ' remember saro-wiwa ' project .
he says a lack of independent regulation makes it impossible to know the true extent of damage across the massive delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pipeline fire burned for 45 days and nights .
" because the region is so full of water , when spills do occur they impact much deeper than just the immediate site , " amunwa said .
" a single spill can affect up to 42 communities , contaminating the water they depend on for drinking , cooking and other every-day purposes . "
oil spill handling in the niger delta , when it happens at all , is often haphazard and inadequate .
amunwa talks of local laborers being hired to dig six foot pits that are then filled with the contaminated soil and set on fire .
the process not only emits further toxins into the environment but often leads to the uncontrollable burning down of crops and economical trees .
money can buy bad behavior and that , says amunwa , is not all .
if they so wish , multinationals can use a get-out clause not to have to tend to their spill at all .
" right now an oil company can simply pay the nigerian government $ 7,000 -lrb- 5,700 euros -rrb- to not clean up .
can you imagine that in the us ?
it 's simply not possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoddy oil regulations do n't just apply in the gulf of mexico in the west african nation , however it is , and far from the proceeds of such impossible dealings being invested back into the niger delta , the estimated 30 million-strong population is being left to foot the bill with their livelihoods and their lives .
" the average lifespan in the niger delta is 40 , " williams said .
" so you see people are living and counting the days . "
those days , he said , are filled with anguish and despair .
no longer able to survive on the fruits of the earth and the bounty of the ocean , local communities have become dependent upon fish imported from other parts of nigeria or abroad .
and pollution has also rendered recognized farming untenable .
in some communities people grow what they can just to keep their families from starving , while in others the pollution has become so bad that residents have been forced to move , often into urban slums . through the fence by stark contrast shell workers in the niger delta capital , port harcourt , live in a gated residential area which offers its inhabitants schooling , medical treatment , shopping , sporting facilities , a choir , a library , cookery classes and even a book club .
" in our normal community there is no light , no water , no hospital , no good roads , it is a gloomy community , " williams said .
" but across the fence you see shell where there is light almost 24 hours a day , an uninterrupted water supply , fine buildings and green vegetation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the shell residential area compound as for the vegetation outside the oil compound , widespread negligence has turned much of it black .
so went wrong ?
" it 's a text book example of the resource curse where you have a country that is almost wholly dependent on oil revenues , " amunwa said .
" there is a strong interest in the government keeping the oil companies happy and ensuring that they can cut corners when it comes to the environment or public safety . "
and there is no reason to believe that corporations are going to change their behavior of their own volition . a group of experts recently estimated that it would cost some $ 20 billion to remediate the niger delta from the impact of known oil spills .
rather more than a few thousand dollars to ignore them .
regulations are everything what activists and the huge local population want to see are regulations that outlaw the kind of bad business ethics that have coated the delta 's mangrove swamps with crude .
ben amunwa said he calls on the new nigerian president , niger deltan goodluck jonathan , to overhaul the regulatory system and pass tougher laws preventing oil companies from being allowed to pay to pollute .
prince chima williams agrees that the country 's new leader has a golden opportunity to bring about change , but he does not put much faith in jonathan to do the decent thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian president goodluck jonathan " this is a president who knows that shell is the biggest polluter of the nigerian environment , yet he appointed a former director of shell as his minister of petroleum , " williams said .
" that speaks for itself . "

" responsibility needs to be imposed on the companies in london , the hague , houston , whereever they have their headquarters because they are escaping justice in nigeria , " amunwa said .

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "

the impact sent his red bull flying into the air .
it landed upside down , before sliding into the tire wall .
webber was able to walk away from the wreckage . bad weekend for mercedes nine drivers were given five-second penalties after the race , a decision which moved birthday-boy nico rosberg up from 12th to 10th . however , his mercedes teammate michael schumacher was not in such a festive mood .

now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .

" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .

he kept second spot though , ahead of mclaren teammate jenson button . hamilton also leads his fellow briton at the top of the drivers ' championship .
twenty-five points for this afternoon 's victory moves vettel up to third , 12 points off the summit . big smash " it 's about time i won from pole .

the impact sent his red bull flying into the air .
it landed upside down , before sliding into the tire wall .
webber was able to walk away from the wreckage . bad weekend for mercedes nine drivers were given five-second penalties after the race , a decision which moved birthday-boy nico rosberg up from 12th to 10th . however , his mercedes teammate michael schumacher was not in such a festive mood .

now , the concept of a non-commercial meeting place for book lovers has caught on . outside of germany , literary houses are n't particularly common . " that 's because it 's a very german tradition for people to sit in a room and listen to a reading for 45 minutes , " rainer moritz , the program director at the literaturhaus hamburg , told deutsche welle . elsewhere , it 's more common to have book signings and discussions with authors about their latest work .
these events are often designed to get people into the bookstore , publicize both the author and the shop , and ultimately sell more books .
literature houses , on the other hand , are less commercially motivated . according to moritz , literature houses are n't just a place for authors to make a stop on their marketing tours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz heads the umbrella organization for german-speaking literature houses " the idea was not only to create a place for reading , but also a gathering place , where authors could meet , translators , journalists and critics , " said moritz .
" that 's why , for us , cafe and bookshop often go together . " literature houses do n't just open their doors for special events - they 're also a place where people can meet for coffee or sit and flip through a magazine . dealers of a legal drug : books " we have the books of the 150 authors who come through during the year - also other books they 've written , but we stock other things too , sometimes just things we find interesting , " said stefan samtleben from the literaturhaus hamburg . " we 've got the stuff for the reading addict and we 're just the dealer of the legal drug and help people have their next trip , " he added . the literaturhaus hamburg should be a place for many different kinds of literature , emphasized mortiz .
" not for all kinds , of course , that would n't work because there is a mainstream that has no need for literature houses .
but i always think it 's sad when literature is so narrowly defined that many forms are excluded and personal taste becomes a main criterion . " literature houses like the one in hamburg focus on newly released works , but each is free to set its own emphasis .
often several authors are invited at once to discuss a particular topic , or talks on historical , political or philosophical issues are organized . a growing literary network in 2002 , 11 literature houses across germany and austria formed an umbrella organization , literaturhaus.net , run by moritz .
the houses plan joint projects and organize a literary prize each year ; the winner is then invited to conduct readings at all 11 locations . while there are many other literary organizations in german-speaking europe , they can not join the umbrella organization unless they 're big enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literature house should be a gathering place , said moritz " we need houses of a certain size , " said moritz .
" they need to be international and not just invite german-speaking authors or organize local projects .
and , for practical reasons , they have to have a certain budget " that is capable of financially supporting literaturhaus.net. the individual literature houses are funded by private clubs or foundations , by renting out their facilities , or by government contributions .
they 're always on the lookout for new sponsors . despite occasional financial difficulties , the literature house concept has established itself so well that it 's been exported to other european cities , including prague , copenhagen and oslo .
in prague and copenhagen , the houses are even identified by the german word .. " that really speaks for the label ' literaturhaus ' that has developed over the past 20 to 25 years , " said moritz . he said that the word literaturhaus did not exist in germany 's definitive dictionary , duden , until he campaigned to have it added .

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protests were violent " a relatively small group of people ... came clearly with the intent of damaging property and perpetrating violence , " he said at a news conference .
" they 're criminals that came to toronto deliberately to break the law . "
groups opposed to the g-20 have been demonstrating in toronto leading up to the summit of the world 's rich and emerging economies , which follows a smaller meeting of the world 's eight richest nations which concluded earlier saturday in the northern ontario resort town of huntsville .
curb deficits , boost growth in toronto on saturday , world leaders closed in on an agreement to halve their budget deficits within three years and boost economic growth .
in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

curb deficits , boost growth in toronto on saturday , world leaders closed in on an agreement to halve their budget deficits within three years and boost economic growth .
in the days leading up to the summit , the united states , the european union and developing countries were at odds over whether to prioritize budget cuts or economic stimulus .
but leaders on saturday looked set to end the disagreement by calling for both , though leaving room for countries to set their own pace .
" to sustain recovery , we need to follow through on delivering existing stimulus plans . ...
at the same time , recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances , " read a draft summit statement .
following the g8 talks in huntsville , german chancellor angela merkel said all leaders had agreed that winding down stimulus programs was critical to curbing budget deficits , while they differed in their opinions on exit speed .
many eu countries have planned tough austerity measures in the wake of the greek debt crisis .
at the same time , the us is considering more stimulus for its own economy , and worries that eu budget cuts could derail the global recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all g8 leaders had agreed that ending stimulus programs was crucial " the scars of this crisis are still with us , " said us treasury secretary timothy geithner .
" we all need to act to strengthen the prospects for growth .
this will require different strategies in different countries .
we are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . "
" we 're aiming at the same target , which is world growth and stability , but ... those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy , which is absolutely vital to growth , " said british prime minister david cameron .
the draft statement indicated that the g-20 is likely to call for fiscal stimulus to be completed this year " where appropriate , " with of " growth-friendly fiscal consolidation " from 2011 .
budget deficits would be halved by 2013 and government debt " stabilized " by 2016 .
brazilian finance minister guido mantega warned , however , that the aim of halving deficits by 2013 was " very draconian , a little exaggerated . "
" we know the remedies , " he said .
" now it 's a matter of gauging and fine-tuning the dosage of this medication .
if we do the right thing at the right dosage , we 'll heal the patient .
if you go too far , you kill it . "

meanwhile , world leaders began economic recovery talks on the first day of the g-20 summit . as world leaders met for the start of the two-day g-20 summit in toronto on saturday , thousands of protesters marched in opposition through city streets .
several hundred turned violent , torching police cars and smashing store windows in the downtown core .
self-described anarchists dressed in black broke away from peaceful protests organized by labor groups , setting at least four police cruisers ablaze , damaging media trucks and vandalizing storefronts , banks and coffee shops .
local media reported that more than 100 people were arrested over the course of the day .
at least 12,000 canadian police and security forces , some on horseback , were patrolling the streets and a three-meter high fence enclosing the summit site .
clad in riot gear and in some instances using tear gas , police faced off against violent protesters in clashes across the city , including one at queen 's park , the provincial parliament building , and on yonge and bloor streets and university avenue , some of toronto 's busiest thoroughfares . toronto mayor david miller condemned the violence , but said it was caused by a small group within the larger protest made up of at least 10,000 .

miroslav klose and lukas podolski scored the other two goals . the game was marked by slick attacking from germany , while england 's defense looked shaky from the beginning .
germany created an early chance after just four minutes when bastian schweinsteiger put attacking midfielder mesut oezil through for a chance that was blocked by english goalkeeper david james . the first goal came after 20 minutes when miroslav klose took advantage of a goal kick from manuel neuer , holding off defender matthew upson to put the ball past david james . the next goal on 32 minutes came after striker lukas podolski scored from a narrow angle on the left of the box from a pass by mueller . england regained some possession but were unable to take advantage and germany continued to push forward . five minutes later , england defender matthew upson rose to a cross from steven gerrard , heading the ball into an empty net past neuer . denied goal england must have thought the gods were against them on the 38 minute mark , as a shot by frank lampard rebounded off the crossbar and bounced behind the line .
the goal was not given - and television replays showed the ball at least a foot or more behind the line . bildunterschrift : neuer looks at the ball during the goal that england was denied german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . " " it was the most important part of the game , " england coach fabio capello said of the decision .
" we made some mistakes and the referee made one big mistake - but germany played a good game . " there were no more chances in the first half , and the teams took a curious 2-1 into the dressing rooms . the takeover england started the second half a little better and defender arne friedrich was booked early on a foul against england forward jermain defoe . coach fabio capello made a substitution on 64 minutes , bringing on attacking midfielder joe cole for james milner . germany scored on 66 minutes when mueller smashed the ball into the net off david james from a pass by schweinsteiger to make the score 3-1 . bildunterschrift : mueller fired germany to victory only three minutes later , mueller netted the fourth after poor defending from england and a cross from mesut oezil sent him through on goal . the 20-year-old mueller was named fifa man of the match . " two goals in one world cup match does not happen too often , " mueller told the reuters news agency .
" but now i want more .
i want to score five or six goals here . " soon after , there was another substitution by england coach fabio capello as forward emile heskey came on for defoe and german coach joachim loew brought mueller and klose off for piotr trochowski and mario gomez . england continued to attack , maintaining posession for long periods but seemed unable to make the breakthrough against germany 's defense . germany will next play argentina in the quarterfinals on saturday . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miroslav klose and lukas podolski scored the other two goals . the game was marked by slick attacking from germany , while england 's defense looked shaky from the beginning .
germany created an early chance after just four minutes when bastian schweinsteiger put attacking midfielder mesut oezil through for a chance that was blocked by english goalkeeper david james . the first goal came after 20 minutes when miroslav klose took advantage of a goal kick from manuel neuer , holding off defender matthew upson to put the ball past david james . the next goal on 32 minutes came after striker lukas podolski scored from a narrow angle on the left of the box from a pass by mueller . england regained some possession but were unable to take advantage and germany continued to push forward . five minutes later , england defender matthew upson rose to a cross from steven gerrard , heading the ball into an empty net past neuer . denied goal england must have thought the gods were against them on the 38 minute mark , as a shot by frank lampard rebounded off the crossbar and bounced behind the line .

" two goals in one world cup match does not happen too often , " mueller told the reuters news agency .
" but now i want more .

" soon after , there was another substitution by england coach fabio capello as forward emile heskey came on for defoe and german coach joachim loew brought mueller and klose off for piotr trochowski and mario gomez . england continued to attack , maintaining posession for long periods but seemed unable to make the breakthrough against germany 's defense . germany will next play argentina in the quarterfinals on saturday . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but now i want more .

it 's also brought memories flooding back of a similar decision that has long been a bone of contention for german fans . for some it was one of the worst refereeing decisions ever , for others it appeared to be poetic justice - a disallowed goal that clearly crossed the line .
germany inflicted a convincing 4-1 defeat on england on sunday , but things could have been different had the uruguayan referee , jorge larrionda , or his assistant seen midfielder frank lampard 's drive in the 38th minute .
lampard hit the ball over german keeper - it bounced off the underside of the crossbar bar and television replays showed it landing a foot or two over the goal line before being swiftly collected by german goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" the referee 's assistant should have seen it , it was clearly a goal , " said former germany team boss franz beckenbauer on german television .
german television commentator guenter netzer said " there were n't too many people in the stadium that did n't see that as a goal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1966 " wembley goal " was strikingly similar to lampard 's effort the disallowed goal in bloemfontein on sunday afternoon came as england staged a fight back after going two goals down .
the trailing side had already pulled one goal back and was looking for the equalizer .
" there is a chance england could go out of the world cup because of a terrible decision and that is totally , totally wrong , " said former england striker alan shearer on bbc television in britain .
" scandal of the world cup , " said the website of spanish daily sports newspaper marca 's website , with the sentiment echoed by italian daily la repubblica .
bitter irony , sweet irony the irony of the decision will not be lost on fans of both teams .
in 1966 , england were awarded a goal they should not have been under similar circumstances in the world cup final .
geoff hurst scored for england during extra time in the team 's home stadium wembley with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing out of the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter has ruled out the use of technology soviet linesman tofik bakhramov incorrectly ruled that a goal had been scored , making the score 3-2 with england winning 4-2 eventually .
germans fans say it changed the course of the game , but that luck was not with england on sunday .
" wembley is back , only the reverse of 1966 .
lampard smashed the ball under the bar and it landed clearly behind the goal line , " said the website of german news magazine der spiegel .
the incident follows repeated calls for the use of goal line technology , including sensors to detect when a goal has been scored .
international soccer governing body fifa has consistently refused .
" we want to keep football as a game of the people with a human face , so we do n't want technology on the field of play because we want to maintain the spontaneity of football - played , administered and controlled by human beings , " fifa president sepp blatter said ahead of the tournament .

bbc - guernsey - guernsey looks at art and islands / arts & culture bbc local -pipe- guernsey -pipe- things to do -pipe- people & places -pipe- tv & radio -pipe- 11:40 gmt , sunday , 27 june 2010 12:40 uk guernsey looks at art and islands by simon de la rue bbc guernsey experts in the cultures of small islands came to guernsey in june 2010 to examine the concept of ' islomania ' - the attraction of islands to the artist and thinker .
local artist and academic eric snell said the island could one day become a hub of artistic display and endeavour .
to that end , mr snell brought together two conferences .
the focus for each : to explore the relationship between the artistic and the insular .
mr snell spoke about the prospect with a verve that goes some way to explaining how one man has been able to bring so much art to such a small location .
" my father was a tomato grower , " he said .
" back in the 1970s he could have had no notion that guernsey could one day become a centre of finance .
" the idea that we could become an international hub of the art world may seem just as distant a proposition now - but why should n't we strive for that ? "
the guernsey college 's ' art and islands ' research initiative held its first conference in september 2008 .
since then , internationally renowned artists such as andy goldsworthy and antony gormley have exhibited their work in the bailiwick .
the second conference aimed to examine the place art has in our society and the influence of islands on the work of artists .
during the same three days , the small island cultures research initiative , based in sydney , australia , held its sixth annual conference in guernsey on a theme inspired by a british novelist .
the writer lawrence durrell coined the word ' islomania ' to describe the irresistible lure of islands , whether as a source of inspiration for artists , writers or musicians , or in relation to the traveller .
mr snell succeeded in luring academics from all over the world for the conferences .
tourist income he said : " we 've had papers delivered by academics from berkeley university , from okinawa university in japan , from jersey , from the shetlands - from a very broad spectrum . "
however , his ambitions for the event went beyond the artistic and academic .
representatives of the states of guernsey and of local businesses were also invited .
mr snell said he believed there was a strong business case for the island to embrace artistic innovations .
he said french research showed : " the average tourist will spend something like 40 euros a day .
the cultural tourists are spending more when they 're travelling and that boosts the income by more than 13 euros per person per day . "
