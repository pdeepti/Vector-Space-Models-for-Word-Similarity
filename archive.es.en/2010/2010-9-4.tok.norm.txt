" i know of no government in the past , that so openly and boldly represents the interests of a tiny part of the economy , " gabriel said . he added it was clear merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her coalition partners free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- would want to extend the lifeline of old nuclear plants as they were electorally backed by the four biggest energy giants . the german chancellor , on the other hand , has argued that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running is indispensable during a transition to renewable sources . " as a bridging technology , until we have really reached the age of renewable energy , nuclear energy is necessary and sensible , " merkel said earlier in the week . what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are long-time opponents to nuclear power in 2002 , the then-ruling coalition of social democrats and greens passed a law that said all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go off line by 2022 at the latest . this sunday , merkel 's cabinet is meeting with business leaders to hammer out a new energy strategy .
germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one was granted . even within her own ranks , however , merkel is struggling to keep control of different factions .
rainer bruederle from the fdp has argued nuclear runtimes should be extended up to 20 years , whereas environment minister norbert roettgen has pressed for a shorter , 10-year extension . eu intervention ? meanwhile , the environmental organization greenpeace said that any extension of the lifespan of nuclear plants needs to be approved by the european commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claims the nuclear extension is only to cover until renewable sources are ready they argue that according to the euratom treaty , a decision like this has to be weighed up with the consequences for other member states too . there is an additional legal doubt that has been raised by germany 's interior and justice ministries that any extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if not approved by the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states . nine out of 16 german states oppose the extension , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . author : catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rallies are being backed by france 's opposition socialist party and the general confederation of labour -lrb- cgt -rrb- , france 's second largest trade union confederation .
protestors are also rallying against a government policy to revoke citizenship for naturalized immigrants found guilty of attacking police officers .

liberty , egality , fraternity . "
demonstrators including actress-singer jane birkin , staged a demonstration in support of undocumented migrants outside the ministry of immigration .
police estimate some 12,000 protestors attended demonstrations in paris alone , while organizers put that figure at 50,000 .
high school principal jean-louis tetrel told news agency reuters there was " a feeling of deepening rage against the government which is rather new , which has been growing in the past few months , " adding , " things are really boiling over now . "
turnout ' a disappointment ' for organizers the human rights league estimated a national turnout of 100,000 , but police say the figure was closer to 30,000 .
french interior minister brice hortefeux dismissed the protests , claiming that participation levels were a disappointment to organizers .
" today 's so-called ' defense of human rights ' demonstrations only managed to bring out , in total , across the whole of the territory a few tens of thousands , " he said .
protests also took place in front of french embassies in capitals such as london , brussels and bucharest .
demonstrations were also held in madrid , rome and the serbian capital belgrade .
in brussels , some 100 demonstrators held signs mocking the 300 euros -lrb- $ 385 -rrb- compensation awarded to roma who voluntarily return to their native countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 1,000 roma have been deported to their native romania ' fighting crime ' french president nicolas sarkozy began a high-profile campaign in july to dismantle half of france 's approximately 600 illegal roma camps within three months , claiming that they were breeding grounds for crime - especially human trafficking and prostitution .
french officials have said the deportations are part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration .
the crackdown , viewed by many as a move to boost sarkozy 's popularity , has been widely criticized in france and abroad .
french media reported that foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was shocked by the president 's anti-crime proposals and even considered resigning over the move .
in late august , the united nations said in a statement that such tactics , as well as " discriminatory political discourse " should be " avoided . "
hundreds homeless human rights groups say the crackdown on illegal roma camps has left hundreds without a roof over their heads .
" this summer , there has been a veritable declaration of war which has manifested itself in the systematic destruction of the places in which they -lrb- roma -rrb- live , " said philippe rodier of medecins du monde -lrb- doctors of the world -rrb- , ahead of a demonstration against disbandment of roma camps in marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say they have offered money to roma to return to romania according to the organization , nine of the 14 roma camps in the city had been destroyed , with hundreds of people now forced to live on the streets .
french authorities have deported nearly 1,000 roma to romania and bulgaria since july .
more than 8,000 have been expelled from their camps since the beginning of the year , with 9,875 expelled throughout 2009 .
there are an estimated 15,000 roma living in france .
under eu freedom of movement laws , they may legally stay in the country for three months without employment or permanent residence , before facing deportation .

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

" i know of no government in the past , that so openly and boldly represents the interests of a tiny part of the economy , " gabriel said . he added it was clear merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her coalition partners free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- would want to extend the lifeline of old nuclear plants as they were electorally backed by the four biggest energy giants . the german chancellor , on the other hand , has argued that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running is indispensable during a transition to renewable sources . " as a bridging technology , until we have really reached the age of renewable energy , nuclear energy is necessary and sensible , " merkel said earlier in the week . what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are long-time opponents to nuclear power in 2002 , the then-ruling coalition of social democrats and greens passed a law that said all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go off line by 2022 at the latest . this sunday , merkel 's cabinet is meeting with business leaders to hammer out a new energy strategy .
germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one was granted . even within her own ranks , however , merkel is struggling to keep control of different factions .
rainer bruederle from the fdp has argued nuclear runtimes should be extended up to 20 years , whereas environment minister norbert roettgen has pressed for a shorter , 10-year extension . eu intervention ? meanwhile , the environmental organization greenpeace said that any extension of the lifespan of nuclear plants needs to be approved by the european commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claims the nuclear extension is only to cover until renewable sources are ready they argue that according to the euratom treaty , a decision like this has to be weighed up with the consequences for other member states too . there is an additional legal doubt that has been raised by germany 's interior and justice ministries that any extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if not approved by the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states . nine out of 16 german states oppose the extension , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . author : catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 04.09.2010 kunduz bombing taught germany nothing , war crimes expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2009 strike raised questions about the german mission in afghanistan an air strike ordered by german troops on two fuel trucks in afghanistan one year ago killed more than 140 people .
law expert gerd hankel told dw that germany has learned nothing from the attack 's legal fallout . on september 4 , 2009 , german col. georg klein gave the order for an air strike in afghanistan on two tankers that had been hijacked by the taliban .
more than 140 people were killed , many of them civilians .
in the ensuing investigation , german prosecutors dropped proceedings against klein , finding that neither he nor any of the other officers were in a position to know that civilians were present at the time of the attack . gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research concentrates on the area of war crimes and international criminal law .
he talked to deutsche welle about the legal dimension of the attack , which has become known as the kunduz affair . dw : what makes determining the legality of this case so hard ? gerd hankel : it is very hard in a case like this to identify individual criminal responsibility ; that is , to make it clear that col. klein knew before the strike that a large number of civilians were likely to be killed . you mentioned criminal responsibility .
do you think a crime was committed ? what has been examined is whether a war crime , as defined by international criminal law , was committed .
that presumes that the perpetrator was sure the military goal was greater importance than the deaths in the civilian population .
he has to have known that .
showing this , which can not be verified , failed from the very beginning .
additionally , there is the possibility of looking at col. klein 's conduct in terms of regular german law to see if it was murder .
or manslaughter .
or involuntary manslaughter .
federal prosecutors looked at this and decided that he could not be accused of any wrongdoing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel klein was cleared of any wrongdoing the prosecutors dropped the case against klein and the military also decided not to press charges against him .
looking at the bigger picture , what went wrong a year ago in kunduz ? what went wrong is that col. klein should have warned the people who were near the tankers and did n't - even when the us pilots offered to do it with a so-called " show of force . "
one can say with good reason that he should have warned them before the strike .
but it can also be seen - as it has been by prosecutors - that is impossible to give advance warning if the point is to kill as many opponents as possible .
as insufferable as the thought is , his actions were within the framework of the law . it is almost as if we have only just realized that war means killing people .
could we prohibit soldiers to kill in war ? yes , there are a whole series of standards which prohibit just that - for example when it comes to civilians .
members of the civilian population may not be killed unless they are directly taking part in the fighting .
but so long as they do not , we can not kill civilians . however , soldiers are also trained to kill people in war .
is this training wrong ?
are they not being sensitive enough ? the problem is that people gradually lose a sense of what is and is not allowed .
then decisions that require a broad interpretation of the rules of law come to be made , as was the case with col. klein . it has not really been strictly defined by politicians what we are actually doing in afghanistan .
is it an " armed conflict " or is it war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two tankers were hit by us jets , killing 142 people that is a serious problem .
in my opinion , current conventional law allows for too much violence in a humanitarian mission - which is what we have in afghanistan .
this violence is counter-productive and does not help a society live at peace .
we can clearly see this from the american experience in iraq and now what the allied forces are experiencing in afghanistan . do there need to be better guidelines for soldiers ? certainly , clear guidelines would not be a bad thing .
but on the other hand , it is very difficult to behave appropriately in certain situations , because often decisions have to be taken very quickly .
in germany , this discussion has resulted in an increasing radicalization of what can be done .
there were engagement guidelines that forced soldiers into a somewhat passive role - which were ridiculed by the international community and other foreign troops in afghanistan .
i think col. klein gave his orders with a certain understanding of these rules .
he certainly also wanted to show that , " german soldiers are not toy soldiers , we can do things too ! " a year has gone .
have lessons been learned ? as it stands , no i do n't think any lessons have been learned .
there are a whole series of commands stating that the civilian population has to be protected , that attacks have to take into account that there should be no collateral damage .
but there have been no mandatory rules , and that 's a major letdown .
that means that you can willingly take a step back , but you always have the option of implementing the old rules and using unlimited amounts of violence . interview : joerg brunsmann / cb editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

"
de gucht said that a " jewish lobby " that wielded much power over politics in the us and should not be underestimated could block progress toward peace in the middle east .
he added that " most jews " believed themselves to be right in matters of israeli-palestinian policy .
jewish groups slam comments the statements sparked criticism from the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- and germany 's central council of jews .
" once again we hear outrageous anti-semitism from a senior european official , " said ejc president moshe kantor , who warned of a new wave of anti-semitism in europe , adding , " the libel of jewish power is apparently acceptable at the highest levels of the eu . "
the european commission on friday distanced itself from de gucht 's remarks .
" for the commission , these are personal comments " that do not reflect the european union 's views , a european commission spokesman told the daily commission briefing .
israel welcomes apology de gucht said friday that he " did not mean in any possible way to cause offence or stigmatize the jewish community ” and that anti-semitism had " no place in today 's world and is fundamentally against our european values . "
israel , which had opposed the initial remarks , welcomed the statement .
foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said : " israel welcomes the fact that eu commission distanced itself from the comments and looks positively on the fact the mr. de gucht apologized . "
it 's not the first karel de gucht has stirred anger with his comments .
he faced criticism two years for remarks he made about corruption in the democratic republic of congo which triggered a diplomatic spat with belgium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 04.09.2010 kunduz bombing taught germany nothing , war crimes expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2009 strike raised questions about the german mission in afghanistan an air strike ordered by german troops on two fuel trucks in afghanistan one year ago killed more than 140 people .
law expert gerd hankel told dw that germany has learned nothing from the attack 's legal fallout . on september 4 , 2009 , german col. georg klein gave the order for an air strike in afghanistan on two tankers that had been hijacked by the taliban .
more than 140 people were killed , many of them civilians .
in the ensuing investigation , german prosecutors dropped proceedings against klein , finding that neither he nor any of the other officers were in a position to know that civilians were present at the time of the attack . gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research concentrates on the area of war crimes and international criminal law .
he talked to deutsche welle about the legal dimension of the attack , which has become known as the kunduz affair . dw : what makes determining the legality of this case so hard ? gerd hankel : it is very hard in a case like this to identify individual criminal responsibility ; that is , to make it clear that col. klein knew before the strike that a large number of civilians were likely to be killed . you mentioned criminal responsibility .
do you think a crime was committed ? what has been examined is whether a war crime , as defined by international criminal law , was committed .
that presumes that the perpetrator was sure the military goal was greater importance than the deaths in the civilian population .
he has to have known that .
showing this , which can not be verified , failed from the very beginning .
additionally , there is the possibility of looking at col. klein 's conduct in terms of regular german law to see if it was murder .
or manslaughter .
or involuntary manslaughter .
federal prosecutors looked at this and decided that he could not be accused of any wrongdoing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel klein was cleared of any wrongdoing the prosecutors dropped the case against klein and the military also decided not to press charges against him .
looking at the bigger picture , what went wrong a year ago in kunduz ? what went wrong is that col. klein should have warned the people who were near the tankers and did n't - even when the us pilots offered to do it with a so-called " show of force . "
one can say with good reason that he should have warned them before the strike .
but it can also be seen - as it has been by prosecutors - that is impossible to give advance warning if the point is to kill as many opponents as possible .
as insufferable as the thought is , his actions were within the framework of the law . it is almost as if we have only just realized that war means killing people .
could we prohibit soldiers to kill in war ? yes , there are a whole series of standards which prohibit just that - for example when it comes to civilians .
members of the civilian population may not be killed unless they are directly taking part in the fighting .
but so long as they do not , we can not kill civilians . however , soldiers are also trained to kill people in war .
is this training wrong ?
are they not being sensitive enough ? the problem is that people gradually lose a sense of what is and is not allowed .
then decisions that require a broad interpretation of the rules of law come to be made , as was the case with col. klein . it has not really been strictly defined by politicians what we are actually doing in afghanistan .
is it an " armed conflict " or is it war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two tankers were hit by us jets , killing 142 people that is a serious problem .
in my opinion , current conventional law allows for too much violence in a humanitarian mission - which is what we have in afghanistan .
this violence is counter-productive and does not help a society live at peace .
we can clearly see this from the american experience in iraq and now what the allied forces are experiencing in afghanistan . do there need to be better guidelines for soldiers ? certainly , clear guidelines would not be a bad thing .
but on the other hand , it is very difficult to behave appropriately in certain situations , because often decisions have to be taken very quickly .
in germany , this discussion has resulted in an increasing radicalization of what can be done .
there were engagement guidelines that forced soldiers into a somewhat passive role - which were ridiculed by the international community and other foreign troops in afghanistan .
i think col. klein gave his orders with a certain understanding of these rules .
he certainly also wanted to show that , " german soldiers are not toy soldiers , we can do things too ! " a year has gone .
have lessons been learned ? as it stands , no i do n't think any lessons have been learned .
there are a whole series of commands stating that the civilian population has to be protected , that attacks have to take into account that there should be no collateral damage .
but there have been no mandatory rules , and that 's a major letdown .
that means that you can willingly take a step back , but you always have the option of implementing the old rules and using unlimited amounts of violence . interview : joerg brunsmann / cb editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a young engineer got sick of riding uphill to go home for lunch each day so he took a car battery and the motor from a set of windshield wipers and installed them on his bicycle , " schaer said .
" it was n't pretty , but it worked . " years of progress the designs at eurobike have made considerable progress over the last 17 years and are being commercially produced in the thousands with motors that have shrunk so dramatically that they 're hardly noticeable . demand is growing as consumers look for a little help in the saddle , according to siegfried neuberger , head of germany 's ziv bicycle industry association . " i think we can describe it as a boom , " he told deutsche welle .
" back in 2007 the market sold 70,000 electric bikes .
this year we 're expecting more than 180,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : battery and propulsion technology keeps improving last year saw the e-bikes ' share of the german bicycle market climbed to 4 percent , with rising exports to the netherlands and scandinavia .
the most popular models are so-called " pedelec " bikes .
they look similar to regular bicycles , but whenever the rider pedals , a small electric motor kicks in to provide additional power to the wheels . advances in battery and propulsion technology mean the extra kick riders get is improving all the time , neuberger said . " the introduction of lithium-ion battery packs has made electric bikes more attractive because they are smaller than earlier batteries , " he said .
" they also carry a bigger charge , and are less prone to memory effects that reduce their effectiveness over time . " increasing demand demand has grown so much that specialist companies like biketec have been able to forego production of mechanical models and concentrate on e-bikes , a step the swiss company took in 2005 . nearly all established german bike brands also offer electric models .
for panther , a bicycle company with over 100 years of history in germany , the decision to go electric was easy , according to marketing director kai wippermann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different types of consumers turn to different e-bike companies " ten years ago we saw e-bikes as an opportunity to add a niche to our general portfolio , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've been quite active in the field because , first , it 's lucrative , and second , the market is growing in line with the social megatrends of healthy living and mobility . " like most german e-bike manufactures , panther has kept its production in germany .
while panther currently employs 120 people on e-bike production in germany , totals for the branch are difficult to estimate as the market for e-bikes keeps growing . big names enter market some of germany 's best-known brands have taken notice of the electric bicycle market .
stuttgart-based electronics giant bosch is one of the latest companies to join the ziv group and will be showcasing its propulsion system at eurobike . while some smaller manufactures have expressed concern that international heavy hitters like bosch could push them out of business , biketec 's schaer said there 's plenty of market share for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some cyclists are looking for a little electric help getting up the hills " most producers have positioned themselves carefully , " he said .
" some companies only make cheap entry models .
customers who want a higher quality e-bike tend to buy from traditional bicycle brands , while those who want a real high-end product go to specialist e-bike manufacturers . " schaer added that the combined capacity of all e-bike manufacturers is still too small to satisfy growing demand .
industry analysts expect that 20 percent of all bikes sold in germany will be electric by 2018 . author : christian siepmann -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wilders told a news conference in the hague that his party had lost confidence in the cda 's ability to form a stable government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rightwing pvv-leader geert wilders has blamed his potential coalition partners " the trust of the freedom party in the christian democrats has recently declined to a low point , " wilders said in a statement broadcast on national television .
" we did n't cause this mess .
we are a stable party . "
the country has been in political stalemate since the june 9 parliamentary elections in which the ruling cda lost half its seats , to 21 , while the pvv emerged with 24 seats .
political observers see support for wilders increasing further should fresh elections be called .
the cda is seeking to form a minority government together with the conservative liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- , which emerged as the strongest party with 31 seats .
but such a minority government would require the tacit support of wilders ' pvv and its 24 seats to control 76 seats , in the 150-seat parliament .
the fallout was sparked by comments made by former prime minister ruud lubbers , tasked with brokering an agreement , who said he was against any cooperation with wilder 's party of freedom because of concerns over freedom of religion .
belgium in political turmoil belgium was also thrown into political turmoil as seven-party talks on forming a government collapsed on friday , september 3 .
the talks had centered on demands for power , influence and funding between the dutch-speaking flanders region and the poorer french-speaking province of wallonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party president elio di rupo throws in the towel elections on june 13 saw two diametrically opposed political parties winning the strongest mandates .
politicians have been trying since to get the two sides to agree on a government program - to no avail . on friday , the man leading the negotiations , french-speaking socialist elio di rupo , asked king albert ii to be relieved of his mission , according to a statement from the palace .
but the king was " withholding his decision " on whether to accept the move pending " consultations " with political leaders , the palace added . political demands the strongest party in flanders , the n-va , wants belgium 's status as a federal state to be replaced with a loose confederation , a move which would give more power and money to flanders .
di rupo offered the n-va a transfer of competences from federal to regional governments worth 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- , and to launch a reform of the law on government financing .
" all conditions were there for the center of gravity to shift from the federal state to the federated entities , " he said . but the n-va , backed by the more moderate cd & v , balked at parallel requests to give brussels - an independent , bilingual region within flanders , whose population is largely french-speaking - a fixed subsidy to patch up its chronic budget deficit .
di rupo initially suggested a 500-million-euro yearly handout , then cut his proposal in half , to 250 million euros .
" we need to start again , " said n-va leader bart de wever , indicating he could not accept a permanent handout for brussels while the reform of government financing still needed to be agreed upon . the political crisis leaves belgium without an effective government .
meanwhile , the country 's six-month-long presidency of the european union is being steered by yves leterme and his caretaker administration .

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

the rallies are being backed by france 's opposition socialist party and the general confederation of labour -lrb- cgt -rrb- , france 's second largest trade union confederation .
protestors are also rallying against a government policy to revoke citizenship for naturalized immigrants found guilty of attacking police officers .
over 110 groups organized demonstrations in 130 towns in france , notably in the capital and the southern cities of marseille , bordeaux and toulouse .
roma lead paris march alongside celebrities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers claim turnout in paris at 50,000 in paris , demonstrators included romanian roma as well as political and artistic figures and union organizers .
they chanted : " no to xenophobia and pillory politics .
liberty , egality , fraternity . "
demonstrators including actress-singer jane birkin , staged a demonstration in support of undocumented migrants outside the ministry of immigration .
police estimate some 12,000 protestors attended demonstrations in paris alone , while organizers put that figure at 50,000 .
high school principal jean-louis tetrel told news agency reuters there was " a feeling of deepening rage against the government which is rather new , which has been growing in the past few months , " adding , " things are really boiling over now . "
turnout ' a disappointment ' for organizers the human rights league estimated a national turnout of 100,000 , but police say the figure was closer to 30,000 .
french interior minister brice hortefeux dismissed the protests , claiming that participation levels were a disappointment to organizers .
" today 's so-called ' defense of human rights ' demonstrations only managed to bring out , in total , across the whole of the territory a few tens of thousands , " he said .
protests also took place in front of french embassies in capitals such as london , brussels and bucharest .
demonstrations were also held in madrid , rome and the serbian capital belgrade .
in brussels , some 100 demonstrators held signs mocking the 300 euros -lrb- $ 385 -rrb- compensation awarded to roma who voluntarily return to their native countries .

french officials have said the deportations are part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration .
the crackdown , viewed by many as a move to boost sarkozy 's popularity , has been widely criticized in france and abroad .
french media reported that foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was shocked by the president 's anti-crime proposals and even considered resigning over the move .

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

"
de gucht said that a " jewish lobby " that wielded much power over politics in the us and should not be underestimated could block progress toward peace in the middle east .
he added that " most jews " believed themselves to be right in matters of israeli-palestinian policy .
jewish groups slam comments the statements sparked criticism from the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- and germany 's central council of jews .
" once again we hear outrageous anti-semitism from a senior european official , " said ejc president moshe kantor , who warned of a new wave of anti-semitism in europe , adding , " the libel of jewish power is apparently acceptable at the highest levels of the eu . "
the european commission on friday distanced itself from de gucht 's remarks .
" for the commission , these are personal comments " that do not reflect the european union 's views , a european commission spokesman told the daily commission briefing .
israel welcomes apology de gucht said friday that he " did not mean in any possible way to cause offence or stigmatize the jewish community ” and that anti-semitism had " no place in today 's world and is fundamentally against our european values . "
israel , which had opposed the initial remarks , welcomed the statement .
foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said : " israel welcomes the fact that eu commission distanced itself from the comments and looks positively on the fact the mr. de gucht apologized . "
it 's not the first karel de gucht has stirred anger with his comments .
he faced criticism two years for remarks he made about corruption in the democratic republic of congo which triggered a diplomatic spat with belgium .

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .

growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 04.09.2010 belgium and the netherlands in political limbo after coalition talks fail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election results proved inconclusive in both belgium and the netherlands with coalition talks deadlocked in belgium and the netherlands , both european countries have been plunged into political crisis . nearly three months after inconclusive elections in the netherlands , the dutch liberal party and the christian democratic alliance have failed to form a coalition government with the support of the far-right party of freedom -lrb- pvv -rrb- led by anti-islamist politician geert wilders .
wilders told a news conference in the hague that his party had lost confidence in the cda 's ability to form a stable government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rightwing pvv-leader geert wilders has blamed his potential coalition partners " the trust of the freedom party in the christian democrats has recently declined to a low point , " wilders said in a statement broadcast on national television .
" we did n't cause this mess .
we are a stable party . "
the country has been in political stalemate since the june 9 parliamentary elections in which the ruling cda lost half its seats , to 21 , while the pvv emerged with 24 seats .
political observers see support for wilders increasing further should fresh elections be called .
the cda is seeking to form a minority government together with the conservative liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- , which emerged as the strongest party with 31 seats .
but such a minority government would require the tacit support of wilders ' pvv and its 24 seats to control 76 seats , in the 150-seat parliament .
the fallout was sparked by comments made by former prime minister ruud lubbers , tasked with brokering an agreement , who said he was against any cooperation with wilder 's party of freedom because of concerns over freedom of religion .
belgium in political turmoil belgium was also thrown into political turmoil as seven-party talks on forming a government collapsed on friday , september 3 .
the talks had centered on demands for power , influence and funding between the dutch-speaking flanders region and the poorer french-speaking province of wallonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party president elio di rupo throws in the towel elections on june 13 saw two diametrically opposed political parties winning the strongest mandates .
politicians have been trying since to get the two sides to agree on a government program - to no avail . on friday , the man leading the negotiations , french-speaking socialist elio di rupo , asked king albert ii to be relieved of his mission , according to a statement from the palace .
but the king was " withholding his decision " on whether to accept the move pending " consultations " with political leaders , the palace added . political demands the strongest party in flanders , the n-va , wants belgium 's status as a federal state to be replaced with a loose confederation , a move which would give more power and money to flanders .
di rupo offered the n-va a transfer of competences from federal to regional governments worth 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- , and to launch a reform of the law on government financing .
" all conditions were there for the center of gravity to shift from the federal state to the federated entities , " he said . but the n-va , backed by the more moderate cd & v , balked at parallel requests to give brussels - an independent , bilingual region within flanders , whose population is largely french-speaking - a fixed subsidy to patch up its chronic budget deficit .
di rupo initially suggested a 500-million-euro yearly handout , then cut his proposal in half , to 250 million euros .
" we need to start again , " said n-va leader bart de wever , indicating he could not accept a permanent handout for brussels while the reform of government financing still needed to be agreed upon . the political crisis leaves belgium without an effective government .
meanwhile , the country 's six-month-long presidency of the european union is being steered by yves leterme and his caretaker administration .

the rallies are being backed by france 's opposition socialist party and the general confederation of labour -lrb- cgt -rrb- , france 's second largest trade union confederation .
protestors are also rallying against a government policy to revoke citizenship for naturalized immigrants found guilty of attacking police officers .
over 110 groups organized demonstrations in 130 towns in france , notably in the capital and the southern cities of marseille , bordeaux and toulouse .
roma lead paris march alongside celebrities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers claim turnout in paris at 50,000 in paris , demonstrators included romanian roma as well as political and artistic figures and union organizers .
they chanted : " no to xenophobia and pillory politics .
liberty , egality , fraternity . "
demonstrators including actress-singer jane birkin , staged a demonstration in support of undocumented migrants outside the ministry of immigration .
police estimate some 12,000 protestors attended demonstrations in paris alone , while organizers put that figure at 50,000 .
high school principal jean-louis tetrel told news agency reuters there was " a feeling of deepening rage against the government which is rather new , which has been growing in the past few months , " adding , " things are really boiling over now . "
turnout ' a disappointment ' for organizers the human rights league estimated a national turnout of 100,000 , but police say the figure was closer to 30,000 .
french interior minister brice hortefeux dismissed the protests , claiming that participation levels were a disappointment to organizers .
" today 's so-called ' defense of human rights ' demonstrations only managed to bring out , in total , across the whole of the territory a few tens of thousands , " he said .
protests also took place in front of french embassies in capitals such as london , brussels and bucharest .
demonstrations were also held in madrid , rome and the serbian capital belgrade .
in brussels , some 100 demonstrators held signs mocking the 300 euros -lrb- $ 385 -rrb- compensation awarded to roma who voluntarily return to their native countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 1,000 roma have been deported to their native romania ' fighting crime ' french president nicolas sarkozy began a high-profile campaign in july to dismantle half of france 's approximately 600 illegal roma camps within three months , claiming that they were breeding grounds for crime - especially human trafficking and prostitution .
french officials have said the deportations are part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration .
the crackdown , viewed by many as a move to boost sarkozy 's popularity , has been widely criticized in france and abroad .
french media reported that foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was shocked by the president 's anti-crime proposals and even considered resigning over the move .
in late august , the united nations said in a statement that such tactics , as well as " discriminatory political discourse " should be " avoided . "
hundreds homeless human rights groups say the crackdown on illegal roma camps has left hundreds without a roof over their heads .
" this summer , there has been a veritable declaration of war which has manifested itself in the systematic destruction of the places in which they -lrb- roma -rrb- live , " said philippe rodier of medecins du monde -lrb- doctors of the world -rrb- , ahead of a demonstration against disbandment of roma camps in marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say they have offered money to roma to return to romania according to the organization , nine of the 14 roma camps in the city had been destroyed , with hundreds of people now forced to live on the streets .
french authorities have deported nearly 1,000 roma to romania and bulgaria since july .
more than 8,000 have been expelled from their camps since the beginning of the year , with 9,875 expelled throughout 2009 .
there are an estimated 15,000 roma living in france .
under eu freedom of movement laws , they may legally stay in the country for three months without employment or permanent residence , before facing deportation .

the rallies are being backed by france 's opposition socialist party and the general confederation of labour -lrb- cgt -rrb- , france 's second largest trade union confederation .
protestors are also rallying against a government policy to revoke citizenship for naturalized immigrants found guilty of attacking police officers .

turnout ' a disappointment ' for organizers the human rights league estimated a national turnout of 100,000 , but police say the figure was closer to 30,000 .
french interior minister brice hortefeux dismissed the protests , claiming that participation levels were a disappointment to organizers .
" today 's so-called ' defense of human rights ' demonstrations only managed to bring out , in total , across the whole of the territory a few tens of thousands , " he said .

french officials have said the deportations are part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration .
the crackdown , viewed by many as a move to boost sarkozy 's popularity , has been widely criticized in france and abroad .
french media reported that foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was shocked by the president 's anti-crime proposals and even considered resigning over the move .
in late august , the united nations said in a statement that such tactics , as well as " discriminatory political discourse " should be " avoided . "

" i know of no government in the past , that so openly and boldly represents the interests of a tiny part of the economy , " gabriel said . he added it was clear merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her coalition partners free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- would want to extend the lifeline of old nuclear plants as they were electorally backed by the four biggest energy giants . the german chancellor , on the other hand , has argued that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running is indispensable during a transition to renewable sources . " as a bridging technology , until we have really reached the age of renewable energy , nuclear energy is necessary and sensible , " merkel said earlier in the week . what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are long-time opponents to nuclear power in 2002 , the then-ruling coalition of social democrats and greens passed a law that said all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go off line by 2022 at the latest . this sunday , merkel 's cabinet is meeting with business leaders to hammer out a new energy strategy .
germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one was granted . even within her own ranks , however , merkel is struggling to keep control of different factions .
rainer bruederle from the fdp has argued nuclear runtimes should be extended up to 20 years , whereas environment minister norbert roettgen has pressed for a shorter , 10-year extension . eu intervention ? meanwhile , the environmental organization greenpeace said that any extension of the lifespan of nuclear plants needs to be approved by the european commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claims the nuclear extension is only to cover until renewable sources are ready they argue that according to the euratom treaty , a decision like this has to be weighed up with the consequences for other member states too . there is an additional legal doubt that has been raised by germany 's interior and justice ministries that any extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if not approved by the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states . nine out of 16 german states oppose the extension , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . author : catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

" i know of no government in the past , that so openly and boldly represents the interests of a tiny part of the economy , " gabriel said . he added it was clear merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her coalition partners free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- would want to extend the lifeline of old nuclear plants as they were electorally backed by the four biggest energy giants . the german chancellor , on the other hand , has argued that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running is indispensable during a transition to renewable sources . " as a bridging technology , until we have really reached the age of renewable energy , nuclear energy is necessary and sensible , " merkel said earlier in the week . what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are long-time opponents to nuclear power in 2002 , the then-ruling coalition of social democrats and greens passed a law that said all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go off line by 2022 at the latest . this sunday , merkel 's cabinet is meeting with business leaders to hammer out a new energy strategy .
germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one was granted . even within her own ranks , however , merkel is struggling to keep control of different factions .
rainer bruederle from the fdp has argued nuclear runtimes should be extended up to 20 years , whereas environment minister norbert roettgen has pressed for a shorter , 10-year extension . eu intervention ? meanwhile , the environmental organization greenpeace said that any extension of the lifespan of nuclear plants needs to be approved by the european commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claims the nuclear extension is only to cover until renewable sources are ready they argue that according to the euratom treaty , a decision like this has to be weighed up with the consequences for other member states too . there is an additional legal doubt that has been raised by germany 's interior and justice ministries that any extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if not approved by the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states . nine out of 16 german states oppose the extension , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . author : catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

" i know of no government in the past , that so openly and boldly represents the interests of a tiny part of the economy , " gabriel said . he added it was clear merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her coalition partners free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- would want to extend the lifeline of old nuclear plants as they were electorally backed by the four biggest energy giants . the german chancellor , on the other hand , has argued that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running is indispensable during a transition to renewable sources . " as a bridging technology , until we have really reached the age of renewable energy , nuclear energy is necessary and sensible , " merkel said earlier in the week . what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are long-time opponents to nuclear power in 2002 , the then-ruling coalition of social democrats and greens passed a law that said all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go off line by 2022 at the latest . this sunday , merkel 's cabinet is meeting with business leaders to hammer out a new energy strategy .
germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one was granted . even within her own ranks , however , merkel is struggling to keep control of different factions .
rainer bruederle from the fdp has argued nuclear runtimes should be extended up to 20 years , whereas environment minister norbert roettgen has pressed for a shorter , 10-year extension . eu intervention ? meanwhile , the environmental organization greenpeace said that any extension of the lifespan of nuclear plants needs to be approved by the european commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claims the nuclear extension is only to cover until renewable sources are ready they argue that according to the euratom treaty , a decision like this has to be weighed up with the consequences for other member states too . there is an additional legal doubt that has been raised by germany 's interior and justice ministries that any extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if not approved by the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states . nine out of 16 german states oppose the extension , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . author : catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rallies are being backed by france 's opposition socialist party and the general confederation of labour -lrb- cgt -rrb- , france 's second largest trade union confederation .
protestors are also rallying against a government policy to revoke citizenship for naturalized immigrants found guilty of attacking police officers .
over 110 groups organized demonstrations in 130 towns in france , notably in the capital and the southern cities of marseille , bordeaux and toulouse .
roma lead paris march alongside celebrities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers claim turnout in paris at 50,000 in paris , demonstrators included romanian roma as well as political and artistic figures and union organizers .
they chanted : " no to xenophobia and pillory politics .
liberty , egality , fraternity . "
demonstrators including actress-singer jane birkin , staged a demonstration in support of undocumented migrants outside the ministry of immigration .
police estimate some 12,000 protestors attended demonstrations in paris alone , while organizers put that figure at 50,000 .
high school principal jean-louis tetrel told news agency reuters there was " a feeling of deepening rage against the government which is rather new , which has been growing in the past few months , " adding , " things are really boiling over now . "
turnout ' a disappointment ' for organizers the human rights league estimated a national turnout of 100,000 , but police say the figure was closer to 30,000 .
french interior minister brice hortefeux dismissed the protests , claiming that participation levels were a disappointment to organizers .
" today 's so-called ' defense of human rights ' demonstrations only managed to bring out , in total , across the whole of the territory a few tens of thousands , " he said .
protests also took place in front of french embassies in capitals such as london , brussels and bucharest .
demonstrations were also held in madrid , rome and the serbian capital belgrade .
in brussels , some 100 demonstrators held signs mocking the 300 euros -lrb- $ 385 -rrb- compensation awarded to roma who voluntarily return to their native countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 1,000 roma have been deported to their native romania ' fighting crime ' french president nicolas sarkozy began a high-profile campaign in july to dismantle half of france 's approximately 600 illegal roma camps within three months , claiming that they were breeding grounds for crime - especially human trafficking and prostitution .
french officials have said the deportations are part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration .
the crackdown , viewed by many as a move to boost sarkozy 's popularity , has been widely criticized in france and abroad .
french media reported that foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was shocked by the president 's anti-crime proposals and even considered resigning over the move .
in late august , the united nations said in a statement that such tactics , as well as " discriminatory political discourse " should be " avoided . "
hundreds homeless human rights groups say the crackdown on illegal roma camps has left hundreds without a roof over their heads .
" this summer , there has been a veritable declaration of war which has manifested itself in the systematic destruction of the places in which they -lrb- roma -rrb- live , " said philippe rodier of medecins du monde -lrb- doctors of the world -rrb- , ahead of a demonstration against disbandment of roma camps in marseille .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say they have offered money to roma to return to romania according to the organization , nine of the 14 roma camps in the city had been destroyed , with hundreds of people now forced to live on the streets .
french authorities have deported nearly 1,000 roma to romania and bulgaria since july .
more than 8,000 have been expelled from their camps since the beginning of the year , with 9,875 expelled throughout 2009 .
there are an estimated 15,000 roma living in france .
under eu freedom of movement laws , they may legally stay in the country for three months without employment or permanent residence , before facing deportation .

wilders told a news conference in the hague that his party had lost confidence in the cda 's ability to form a stable government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rightwing pvv-leader geert wilders has blamed his potential coalition partners " the trust of the freedom party in the christian democrats has recently declined to a low point , " wilders said in a statement broadcast on national television .
" we did n't cause this mess .
we are a stable party . "
the country has been in political stalemate since the june 9 parliamentary elections in which the ruling cda lost half its seats , to 21 , while the pvv emerged with 24 seats .
political observers see support for wilders increasing further should fresh elections be called .
the cda is seeking to form a minority government together with the conservative liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- , which emerged as the strongest party with 31 seats .
but such a minority government would require the tacit support of wilders ' pvv and its 24 seats to control 76 seats , in the 150-seat parliament .
the fallout was sparked by comments made by former prime minister ruud lubbers , tasked with brokering an agreement , who said he was against any cooperation with wilder 's party of freedom because of concerns over freedom of religion .
belgium in political turmoil belgium was also thrown into political turmoil as seven-party talks on forming a government collapsed on friday , september 3 .
the talks had centered on demands for power , influence and funding between the dutch-speaking flanders region and the poorer french-speaking province of wallonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party president elio di rupo throws in the towel elections on june 13 saw two diametrically opposed political parties winning the strongest mandates .
politicians have been trying since to get the two sides to agree on a government program - to no avail . on friday , the man leading the negotiations , french-speaking socialist elio di rupo , asked king albert ii to be relieved of his mission , according to a statement from the palace .
but the king was " withholding his decision " on whether to accept the move pending " consultations " with political leaders , the palace added . political demands the strongest party in flanders , the n-va , wants belgium 's status as a federal state to be replaced with a loose confederation , a move which would give more power and money to flanders .
di rupo offered the n-va a transfer of competences from federal to regional governments worth 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- , and to launch a reform of the law on government financing .
" all conditions were there for the center of gravity to shift from the federal state to the federated entities , " he said . but the n-va , backed by the more moderate cd & v , balked at parallel requests to give brussels - an independent , bilingual region within flanders , whose population is largely french-speaking - a fixed subsidy to patch up its chronic budget deficit .
di rupo initially suggested a 500-million-euro yearly handout , then cut his proposal in half , to 250 million euros .
" we need to start again , " said n-va leader bart de wever , indicating he could not accept a permanent handout for brussels while the reform of government financing still needed to be agreed upon . the political crisis leaves belgium without an effective government .
meanwhile , the country 's six-month-long presidency of the european union is being steered by yves leterme and his caretaker administration .

" i know of no government in the past , that so openly and boldly represents the interests of a tiny part of the economy , " gabriel said . he added it was clear merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her coalition partners free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- would want to extend the lifeline of old nuclear plants as they were electorally backed by the four biggest energy giants . the german chancellor , on the other hand , has argued that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running is indispensable during a transition to renewable sources . " as a bridging technology , until we have really reached the age of renewable energy , nuclear energy is necessary and sensible , " merkel said earlier in the week . what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are long-time opponents to nuclear power in 2002 , the then-ruling coalition of social democrats and greens passed a law that said all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go off line by 2022 at the latest . this sunday , merkel 's cabinet is meeting with business leaders to hammer out a new energy strategy .
germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one was granted . even within her own ranks , however , merkel is struggling to keep control of different factions .
rainer bruederle from the fdp has argued nuclear runtimes should be extended up to 20 years , whereas environment minister norbert roettgen has pressed for a shorter , 10-year extension . eu intervention ? meanwhile , the environmental organization greenpeace said that any extension of the lifespan of nuclear plants needs to be approved by the european commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claims the nuclear extension is only to cover until renewable sources are ready they argue that according to the euratom treaty , a decision like this has to be weighed up with the consequences for other member states too . there is an additional legal doubt that has been raised by germany 's interior and justice ministries that any extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if not approved by the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states . nine out of 16 german states oppose the extension , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . author : catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
de gucht said that a " jewish lobby " that wielded much power over politics in the us and should not be underestimated could block progress toward peace in the middle east .
he added that " most jews " believed themselves to be right in matters of israeli-palestinian policy .
jewish groups slam comments the statements sparked criticism from the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- and germany 's central council of jews .
" once again we hear outrageous anti-semitism from a senior european official , " said ejc president moshe kantor , who warned of a new wave of anti-semitism in europe , adding , " the libel of jewish power is apparently acceptable at the highest levels of the eu . "
the european commission on friday distanced itself from de gucht 's remarks .
" for the commission , these are personal comments " that do not reflect the european union 's views , a european commission spokesman told the daily commission briefing .
israel welcomes apology de gucht said friday that he " did not mean in any possible way to cause offence or stigmatize the jewish community ” and that anti-semitism had " no place in today 's world and is fundamentally against our european values . "
israel , which had opposed the initial remarks , welcomed the statement .
foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said : " israel welcomes the fact that eu commission distanced itself from the comments and looks positively on the fact the mr. de gucht apologized . "
it 's not the first karel de gucht has stirred anger with his comments .
he faced criticism two years for remarks he made about corruption in the democratic republic of congo which triggered a diplomatic spat with belgium .

" i know of no government in the past , that so openly and boldly represents the interests of a tiny part of the economy , " gabriel said . he added it was clear merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her coalition partners free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- would want to extend the lifeline of old nuclear plants as they were electorally backed by the four biggest energy giants . the german chancellor , on the other hand , has argued that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running is indispensable during a transition to renewable sources . " as a bridging technology , until we have really reached the age of renewable energy , nuclear energy is necessary and sensible , " merkel said earlier in the week . what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are long-time opponents to nuclear power in 2002 , the then-ruling coalition of social democrats and greens passed a law that said all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go off line by 2022 at the latest . this sunday , merkel 's cabinet is meeting with business leaders to hammer out a new energy strategy .
germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one was granted . even within her own ranks , however , merkel is struggling to keep control of different factions .
rainer bruederle from the fdp has argued nuclear runtimes should be extended up to 20 years , whereas environment minister norbert roettgen has pressed for a shorter , 10-year extension . eu intervention ? meanwhile , the environmental organization greenpeace said that any extension of the lifespan of nuclear plants needs to be approved by the european commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claims the nuclear extension is only to cover until renewable sources are ready they argue that according to the euratom treaty , a decision like this has to be weighed up with the consequences for other member states too . there is an additional legal doubt that has been raised by germany 's interior and justice ministries that any extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if not approved by the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states . nine out of 16 german states oppose the extension , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . author : catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

at least two protestors were arrested as a flip-flop landed on the roof of a bmw in blair 's motorcade .
riot police were brought in to remove several protesters who had laid themselves in front of a police van .
blair remained unscathed and spent about two hours in the store .
blair 's book , " a journey , " which was released earlier in the week , recounts his decade at 10 downing street from 1997 to 2007 .
the autobiography has angered iraq-war opponents with its defense of his decision to participate in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .

blair also said friday in an interview for irish state television rte , that he could foresee the need for military intervention to stop iran 's nuclear program - suspected by the international community of developing nuclear weapons capabilities .
" i still think this incidentally today that we have this fundamentalist , extremist threat that is based on the perversion of the religion of islam but it 's still there and we have to deal with it , " blair said .

at least two protestors were arrested as a flip-flop landed on the roof of a bmw in blair 's motorcade .
riot police were brought in to remove several protesters who had laid themselves in front of a police van .
blair remained unscathed and spent about two hours in the store .
blair 's book , " a journey , " which was released earlier in the week , recounts his decade at 10 downing street from 1997 to 2007 .
the autobiography has angered iraq-war opponents with its defense of his decision to participate in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq . ' blair lied , millions died ' campaigners held signs outside the store reading " blair lied , millions died , " while chanting " arrest the butcher blair " and " blair , blair , bush 's man and blood , blood on their hands .

"
de gucht said that a " jewish lobby " that wielded much power over politics in the us and should not be underestimated could block progress toward peace in the middle east .
he added that " most jews " believed themselves to be right in matters of israeli-palestinian policy .
jewish groups slam comments the statements sparked criticism from the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- and germany 's central council of jews .
" once again we hear outrageous anti-semitism from a senior european official , " said ejc president moshe kantor , who warned of a new wave of anti-semitism in europe , adding , " the libel of jewish power is apparently acceptable at the highest levels of the eu . "
the european commission on friday distanced itself from de gucht 's remarks .
" for the commission , these are personal comments " that do not reflect the european union 's views , a european commission spokesman told the daily commission briefing .

israel , which had opposed the initial remarks , welcomed the statement .
foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said : " israel welcomes the fact that eu commission distanced itself from the comments and looks positively on the fact the mr. de gucht apologized . "
it 's not the first karel de gucht has stirred anger with his comments .
he faced criticism two years for remarks he made about corruption in the democratic republic of congo which triggered a diplomatic spat with belgium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 04.09.2010 belgium and the netherlands in political limbo after coalition talks fail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election results proved inconclusive in both belgium and the netherlands with coalition talks deadlocked in belgium and the netherlands , both european countries have been plunged into political crisis . nearly three months after inconclusive elections in the netherlands , the dutch liberal party and the christian democratic alliance have failed to form a coalition government with the support of the far-right party of freedom -lrb- pvv -rrb- led by anti-islamist politician geert wilders .
wilders told a news conference in the hague that his party had lost confidence in the cda 's ability to form a stable government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rightwing pvv-leader geert wilders has blamed his potential coalition partners " the trust of the freedom party in the christian democrats has recently declined to a low point , " wilders said in a statement broadcast on national television .
" we did n't cause this mess .
we are a stable party . "
the country has been in political stalemate since the june 9 parliamentary elections in which the ruling cda lost half its seats , to 21 , while the pvv emerged with 24 seats .
political observers see support for wilders increasing further should fresh elections be called .
the cda is seeking to form a minority government together with the conservative liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- , which emerged as the strongest party with 31 seats .
but such a minority government would require the tacit support of wilders ' pvv and its 24 seats to control 76 seats , in the 150-seat parliament .
the fallout was sparked by comments made by former prime minister ruud lubbers , tasked with brokering an agreement , who said he was against any cooperation with wilder 's party of freedom because of concerns over freedom of religion .
belgium in political turmoil belgium was also thrown into political turmoil as seven-party talks on forming a government collapsed on friday , september 3 .
the talks had centered on demands for power , influence and funding between the dutch-speaking flanders region and the poorer french-speaking province of wallonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party president elio di rupo throws in the towel elections on june 13 saw two diametrically opposed political parties winning the strongest mandates .
politicians have been trying since to get the two sides to agree on a government program - to no avail . on friday , the man leading the negotiations , french-speaking socialist elio di rupo , asked king albert ii to be relieved of his mission , according to a statement from the palace .
but the king was " withholding his decision " on whether to accept the move pending " consultations " with political leaders , the palace added . political demands the strongest party in flanders , the n-va , wants belgium 's status as a federal state to be replaced with a loose confederation , a move which would give more power and money to flanders .
di rupo offered the n-va a transfer of competences from federal to regional governments worth 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- , and to launch a reform of the law on government financing .
" all conditions were there for the center of gravity to shift from the federal state to the federated entities , " he said . but the n-va , backed by the more moderate cd & v , balked at parallel requests to give brussels - an independent , bilingual region within flanders , whose population is largely french-speaking - a fixed subsidy to patch up its chronic budget deficit .
di rupo initially suggested a 500-million-euro yearly handout , then cut his proposal in half , to 250 million euros .
" we need to start again , " said n-va leader bart de wever , indicating he could not accept a permanent handout for brussels while the reform of government financing still needed to be agreed upon . the political crisis leaves belgium without an effective government .
meanwhile , the country 's six-month-long presidency of the european union is being steered by yves leterme and his caretaker administration .

wilders told a news conference in the hague that his party had lost confidence in the cda 's ability to form a stable government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rightwing pvv-leader geert wilders has blamed his potential coalition partners " the trust of the freedom party in the christian democrats has recently declined to a low point , " wilders said in a statement broadcast on national television .
" we did n't cause this mess .
we are a stable party . "
the country has been in political stalemate since the june 9 parliamentary elections in which the ruling cda lost half its seats , to 21 , while the pvv emerged with 24 seats .
political observers see support for wilders increasing further should fresh elections be called .
the cda is seeking to form a minority government together with the conservative liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- , which emerged as the strongest party with 31 seats .
but such a minority government would require the tacit support of wilders ' pvv and its 24 seats to control 76 seats , in the 150-seat parliament .
the fallout was sparked by comments made by former prime minister ruud lubbers , tasked with brokering an agreement , who said he was against any cooperation with wilder 's party of freedom because of concerns over freedom of religion .
belgium in political turmoil belgium was also thrown into political turmoil as seven-party talks on forming a government collapsed on friday , september 3 .
the talks had centered on demands for power , influence and funding between the dutch-speaking flanders region and the poorer french-speaking province of wallonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party president elio di rupo throws in the towel elections on june 13 saw two diametrically opposed political parties winning the strongest mandates .
politicians have been trying since to get the two sides to agree on a government program - to no avail . on friday , the man leading the negotiations , french-speaking socialist elio di rupo , asked king albert ii to be relieved of his mission , according to a statement from the palace .
but the king was " withholding his decision " on whether to accept the move pending " consultations " with political leaders , the palace added . political demands the strongest party in flanders , the n-va , wants belgium 's status as a federal state to be replaced with a loose confederation , a move which would give more power and money to flanders .
di rupo offered the n-va a transfer of competences from federal to regional governments worth 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- , and to launch a reform of the law on government financing .
" all conditions were there for the center of gravity to shift from the federal state to the federated entities , " he said . but the n-va , backed by the more moderate cd & v , balked at parallel requests to give brussels - an independent , bilingual region within flanders , whose population is largely french-speaking - a fixed subsidy to patch up its chronic budget deficit .
di rupo initially suggested a 500-million-euro yearly handout , then cut his proposal in half , to 250 million euros .
" we need to start again , " said n-va leader bart de wever , indicating he could not accept a permanent handout for brussels while the reform of government financing still needed to be agreed upon . the political crisis leaves belgium without an effective government .
meanwhile , the country 's six-month-long presidency of the european union is being steered by yves leterme and his caretaker administration .

protestors say the plans are too expensive during a time of economic austerity . the protest movement against the multi-billion-euro railway project stuttgart 21 is showing no signs of losing momentum . on friday , sept .

protest organisers claimed the number of people taking part was closer to 65,000 . the campaign went well into the evening , with those taking part lighting candles , torches and flares .
among the protesters was former long-distance runner dieter baumann . the stuttgart 21 project aims to completely remodel the city 's train station , as well as transform the state of baden-wuerttemberg into a major hub of european rail transportation .
stuttgart would become part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . a waste of money ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned about the fallout from the construction site platforms are to be sunk underground , freeing up space in the city-center , and the current terminus-station should become a through-station , making journey times quicker . critics , however , say the plans are unnecessary and a waste of tax payers ' money .

the rallies are being backed by france 's opposition socialist party and the general confederation of labour -lrb- cgt -rrb- , france 's second largest trade union confederation .
protestors are also rallying against a government policy to revoke citizenship for naturalized immigrants found guilty of attacking police officers .
over 110 groups organized demonstrations in 130 towns in france , notably in the capital and the southern cities of marseille , bordeaux and toulouse .
roma lead paris march alongside celebrities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers claim turnout in paris at 50,000 in paris , demonstrators included romanian roma as well as political and artistic figures and union organizers .
they chanted : " no to xenophobia and pillory politics .
liberty , egality , fraternity . "
demonstrators including actress-singer jane birkin , staged a demonstration in support of undocumented migrants outside the ministry of immigration .
police estimate some 12,000 protestors attended demonstrations in paris alone , while organizers put that figure at 50,000 .
high school principal jean-louis tetrel told news agency reuters there was " a feeling of deepening rage against the government which is rather new , which has been growing in the past few months , " adding , " things are really boiling over now . "
turnout ' a disappointment ' for organizers the human rights league estimated a national turnout of 100,000 , but police say the figure was closer to 30,000 .
french interior minister brice hortefeux dismissed the protests , claiming that participation levels were a disappointment to organizers .
" today 's so-called ' defense of human rights ' demonstrations only managed to bring out , in total , across the whole of the territory a few tens of thousands , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 04.09.2010 berlin under pressure ahead of energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is deciding the future of germany 's nuclear power plants ahead of sunday 's energy summit in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel 's support for extending the life of nuclear power plants has come up against strong resistance from green campaigners and the opposition . the energy policies of germany 's ruling coalition have came under increased scrutiny and fire just as angela merkel was preparing to meet colleagues to discuss the burning issue of prolonging the operations of the country 's remaining nuclear power plants . speaking to the berlin radio station rbb inforadio on saturday , september 4 , the chairman of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , sigmar gabriel , claimed that policy was being " strongly politically influenced " by major energy companies . " i know of no government in the past , that so openly and boldly represents the interests of a tiny part of the economy , " gabriel said . he added it was clear merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her coalition partners free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- would want to extend the lifeline of old nuclear plants as they were electorally backed by the four biggest energy giants . the german chancellor , on the other hand , has argued that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running is indispensable during a transition to renewable sources . " as a bridging technology , until we have really reached the age of renewable energy , nuclear energy is necessary and sensible , " merkel said earlier in the week . what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are long-time opponents to nuclear power in 2002 , the then-ruling coalition of social democrats and greens passed a law that said all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go off line by 2022 at the latest . this sunday , merkel 's cabinet is meeting with business leaders to hammer out a new energy strategy .
germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one was granted . even within her own ranks , however , merkel is struggling to keep control of different factions .
rainer bruederle from the fdp has argued nuclear runtimes should be extended up to 20 years , whereas environment minister norbert roettgen has pressed for a shorter , 10-year extension . eu intervention ? meanwhile , the environmental organization greenpeace said that any extension of the lifespan of nuclear plants needs to be approved by the european commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claims the nuclear extension is only to cover until renewable sources are ready they argue that according to the euratom treaty , a decision like this has to be weighed up with the consequences for other member states too . there is an additional legal doubt that has been raised by germany 's interior and justice ministries that any extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if not approved by the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states . nine out of 16 german states oppose the extension , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . author : catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

the new synagogue was opened on friday by president christian wulff who expressed happiness that " the jewish community once again will have an architectural and religious center . "
a " small miracle " wulff spoke of " a small miracle . "
the " revival of jewish life in germany is continuing " thanks to the new synagogue , he said . " that 's a blessing for our country , a blessing for germany . "
in another sign that jewish life is thriving in germany , two rabbis , who have migrated from the former soviet union , were ordained last week at a ceremony in leipzig .
the rabbis graduated from the berlin orthodox seminary and more than 300 german and foreign jewish leaders attended the ordination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz used to be a center of european judaism " judaism is alive and well in germany , " said world jewish congress president ronald lauder at the ceremony , whose foundation supports the berlin seminary .
growing jewish community when hitler came to power in germany in 1933 , there were more than 530,000 jews living in the country .
by 1939 and the start of world war ii , this number had dwindled to 200,000 as many emigrated to escape nazi violence .
just a few thousand of these survived the war .
numbers today are back to more than 100,000 , as the government made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to move to germany and obtain citizenship .
in leipzig , numbers have grown from 30 worshippers in 1989 to nearly 1,300 – mostly immigrants from the former ussr .
the two new orthodox rabbis are among the new arrivals , with one originally from uzbekistan and one from lithuania .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mainz synagogue opening , wulff vowed unity synagogue as " a symbol of trust " before the nazis came to power , the western city of mainz was a center of european judaism for centuries .
the former synagogue in the city was desecrated by the nazis during the nationwide pogroms of november 1938 known as krystallnacht .
more than half of the pre-nazi 2,300 strong jewish community died in concentration camps , according to the mainz municipality .
the ten-million-euro -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- new synagogue has been designed by the cologne architect manuel herz and president wulff called it " a symbol of trust in our nation . "
wulff also used the opening ceremony to underline the importance of being tolerant and open-minded .
" anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia in all its forms represent today one of the great evils of our times , " he added .

law expert gerd hankel told dw that germany has learned nothing from the attack 's legal fallout . on september 4 , 2009 , german col. georg klein gave the order for an air strike in afghanistan on two tankers that had been hijacked by the taliban .
more than 140 people were killed , many of them civilians .
in the ensuing investigation , german prosecutors dropped proceedings against klein , finding that neither he nor any of the other officers were in a position to know that civilians were present at the time of the attack . gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research concentrates on the area of war crimes and international criminal law .
he talked to deutsche welle about the legal dimension of the attack , which has become known as the kunduz affair . dw : what makes determining the legality of this case so hard ? gerd hankel : it is very hard in a case like this to identify individual criminal responsibility ; that is , to make it clear that col. klein knew before the strike that a large number of civilians were likely to be killed . you mentioned criminal responsibility .
do you think a crime was committed ? what has been examined is whether a war crime , as defined by international criminal law , was committed .
that presumes that the perpetrator was sure the military goal was greater importance than the deaths in the civilian population .
he has to have known that .
showing this , which can not be verified , failed from the very beginning .
additionally , there is the possibility of looking at col. klein 's conduct in terms of regular german law to see if it was murder .
or manslaughter .
or involuntary manslaughter .
federal prosecutors looked at this and decided that he could not be accused of any wrongdoing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel klein was cleared of any wrongdoing the prosecutors dropped the case against klein and the military also decided not to press charges against him .
looking at the bigger picture , what went wrong a year ago in kunduz ? what went wrong is that col. klein should have warned the people who were near the tankers and did n't - even when the us pilots offered to do it with a so-called " show of force . "
one can say with good reason that he should have warned them before the strike .
but it can also be seen - as it has been by prosecutors - that is impossible to give advance warning if the point is to kill as many opponents as possible .
as insufferable as the thought is , his actions were within the framework of the law . it is almost as if we have only just realized that war means killing people .
could we prohibit soldiers to kill in war ? yes , there are a whole series of standards which prohibit just that - for example when it comes to civilians .
members of the civilian population may not be killed unless they are directly taking part in the fighting .
but so long as they do not , we can not kill civilians . however , soldiers are also trained to kill people in war .
is this training wrong ?
are they not being sensitive enough ? the problem is that people gradually lose a sense of what is and is not allowed .
then decisions that require a broad interpretation of the rules of law come to be made , as was the case with col. klein . it has not really been strictly defined by politicians what we are actually doing in afghanistan .
is it an " armed conflict " or is it war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two tankers were hit by us jets , killing 142 people that is a serious problem .
in my opinion , current conventional law allows for too much violence in a humanitarian mission - which is what we have in afghanistan .
this violence is counter-productive and does not help a society live at peace .
we can clearly see this from the american experience in iraq and now what the allied forces are experiencing in afghanistan . do there need to be better guidelines for soldiers ? certainly , clear guidelines would not be a bad thing .
but on the other hand , it is very difficult to behave appropriately in certain situations , because often decisions have to be taken very quickly .
in germany , this discussion has resulted in an increasing radicalization of what can be done .
there were engagement guidelines that forced soldiers into a somewhat passive role - which were ridiculed by the international community and other foreign troops in afghanistan .
i think col. klein gave his orders with a certain understanding of these rules .
he certainly also wanted to show that , " german soldiers are not toy soldiers , we can do things too ! " a year has gone .
have lessons been learned ? as it stands , no i do n't think any lessons have been learned .
there are a whole series of commands stating that the civilian population has to be protected , that attacks have to take into account that there should be no collateral damage .
but there have been no mandatory rules , and that 's a major letdown .
that means that you can willingly take a step back , but you always have the option of implementing the old rules and using unlimited amounts of violence . interview : joerg brunsmann / cb editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

law expert gerd hankel told dw that germany has learned nothing from the attack 's legal fallout . on september 4 , 2009 , german col. georg klein gave the order for an air strike in afghanistan on two tankers that had been hijacked by the taliban .
more than 140 people were killed , many of them civilians .
in the ensuing investigation , german prosecutors dropped proceedings against klein , finding that neither he nor any of the other officers were in a position to know that civilians were present at the time of the attack . gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research concentrates on the area of war crimes and international criminal law .
he talked to deutsche welle about the legal dimension of the attack , which has become known as the kunduz affair . dw : what makes determining the legality of this case so hard ? gerd hankel : it is very hard in a case like this to identify individual criminal responsibility ; that is , to make it clear that col. klein knew before the strike that a large number of civilians were likely to be killed . you mentioned criminal responsibility .
do you think a crime was committed ? what has been examined is whether a war crime , as defined by international criminal law , was committed .
that presumes that the perpetrator was sure the military goal was greater importance than the deaths in the civilian population .
he has to have known that .
showing this , which can not be verified , failed from the very beginning .
additionally , there is the possibility of looking at col. klein 's conduct in terms of regular german law to see if it was murder .
or manslaughter .
or involuntary manslaughter .
federal prosecutors looked at this and decided that he could not be accused of any wrongdoing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel klein was cleared of any wrongdoing the prosecutors dropped the case against klein and the military also decided not to press charges against him .
looking at the bigger picture , what went wrong a year ago in kunduz ? what went wrong is that col. klein should have warned the people who were near the tankers and did n't - even when the us pilots offered to do it with a so-called " show of force . "
one can say with good reason that he should have warned them before the strike .
but it can also be seen - as it has been by prosecutors - that is impossible to give advance warning if the point is to kill as many opponents as possible .
as insufferable as the thought is , his actions were within the framework of the law . it is almost as if we have only just realized that war means killing people .
could we prohibit soldiers to kill in war ? yes , there are a whole series of standards which prohibit just that - for example when it comes to civilians .
members of the civilian population may not be killed unless they are directly taking part in the fighting .
but so long as they do not , we can not kill civilians . however , soldiers are also trained to kill people in war .
is this training wrong ?
are they not being sensitive enough ? the problem is that people gradually lose a sense of what is and is not allowed .
then decisions that require a broad interpretation of the rules of law come to be made , as was the case with col. klein . it has not really been strictly defined by politicians what we are actually doing in afghanistan .
is it an " armed conflict " or is it war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two tankers were hit by us jets , killing 142 people that is a serious problem .
in my opinion , current conventional law allows for too much violence in a humanitarian mission - which is what we have in afghanistan .
this violence is counter-productive and does not help a society live at peace .
we can clearly see this from the american experience in iraq and now what the allied forces are experiencing in afghanistan . do there need to be better guidelines for soldiers ? certainly , clear guidelines would not be a bad thing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 04.09.2010 berlin under pressure ahead of energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is deciding the future of germany 's nuclear power plants ahead of sunday 's energy summit in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel 's support for extending the life of nuclear power plants has come up against strong resistance from green campaigners and the opposition . the energy policies of germany 's ruling coalition have came under increased scrutiny and fire just as angela merkel was preparing to meet colleagues to discuss the burning issue of prolonging the operations of the country 's remaining nuclear power plants . speaking to the berlin radio station rbb inforadio on saturday , september 4 , the chairman of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , sigmar gabriel , claimed that policy was being " strongly politically influenced " by major energy companies . " i know of no government in the past , that so openly and boldly represents the interests of a tiny part of the economy , " gabriel said . he added it was clear merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her coalition partners free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- would want to extend the lifeline of old nuclear plants as they were electorally backed by the four biggest energy giants . the german chancellor , on the other hand , has argued that keeping germany 's nuclear plants running is indispensable during a transition to renewable sources . " as a bridging technology , until we have really reached the age of renewable energy , nuclear energy is necessary and sensible , " merkel said earlier in the week . what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are long-time opponents to nuclear power in 2002 , the then-ruling coalition of social democrats and greens passed a law that said all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go off line by 2022 at the latest . this sunday , merkel 's cabinet is meeting with business leaders to hammer out a new energy strategy .
germany has 17 nuclear power plants , but it is not certain how many would be given extensions if one was granted . even within her own ranks , however , merkel is struggling to keep control of different factions .
rainer bruederle from the fdp has argued nuclear runtimes should be extended up to 20 years , whereas environment minister norbert roettgen has pressed for a shorter , 10-year extension . eu intervention ? meanwhile , the environmental organization greenpeace said that any extension of the lifespan of nuclear plants needs to be approved by the european commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claims the nuclear extension is only to cover until renewable sources are ready they argue that according to the euratom treaty , a decision like this has to be weighed up with the consequences for other member states too . there is an additional legal doubt that has been raised by germany 's interior and justice ministries that any extension of more than 10 years could be illegal if not approved by the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states . nine out of 16 german states oppose the extension , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . author : catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
de gucht said that a " jewish lobby " that wielded much power over politics in the us and should not be underestimated could block progress toward peace in the middle east .
he added that " most jews " believed themselves to be right in matters of israeli-palestinian policy .
jewish groups slam comments the statements sparked criticism from the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- and germany 's central council of jews .
" once again we hear outrageous anti-semitism from a senior european official , " said ejc president moshe kantor , who warned of a new wave of anti-semitism in europe , adding , " the libel of jewish power is apparently acceptable at the highest levels of the eu . "
the european commission on friday distanced itself from de gucht 's remarks .
" for the commission , these are personal comments " that do not reflect the european union 's views , a european commission spokesman told the daily commission briefing .
israel welcomes apology de gucht said friday that he " did not mean in any possible way to cause offence or stigmatize the jewish community ” and that anti-semitism had " no place in today 's world and is fundamentally against our european values . "
israel , which had opposed the initial remarks , welcomed the statement .
foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said : " israel welcomes the fact that eu commission distanced itself from the comments and looks positively on the fact the mr. de gucht apologized . "
it 's not the first karel de gucht has stirred anger with his comments .
he faced criticism two years for remarks he made about corruption in the democratic republic of congo which triggered a diplomatic spat with belgium .
