after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

the country ’ s other female biathlon hopefuls did not fare nearly so well . germany 's biathlon ace magdalena neuner lost to her slovakian rival by only the narrowest of margins but claimed germany 's first medal .
neuner , who has won six world championships , picked up a silver medal while anastastiya kuzmina emerged victorious in the 7.5 kilometer sprint skiing and shooting event .
kuzmina finished the skiing section 1.5 seconds ahead of the 23-year-old german , who also missed one target on the shooting range .
' one mistake is good ' despite being so close to her first olympic gold , neuner said that she was delighted with the result .
" i am very happy , it is a silver , it is great .
one mistake is good , " she said .
neuner won her first world championship in 2008 and was making her olympic debut .
she has a reputation as a fast skier but is also known for regularly missing shots .
" i was hardly nervous , very focused and looked forward to the race , " she said .
but neuner did admit to running out of strength .
" i gave everything i had , she said .
" if only i could have gone a little faster .
i lost strength in the last leg . "

she incurred one penalty point in shooting .
" i was in good shape and the skis went well , so here i am , " said kuzmina who admitted she was " surprised " to have won .

kuzmina finished the skiing section 1.5 seconds ahead of the 23-year-old german , who also missed one target on the shooting range .
' one mistake is good ' despite being so close to her first olympic gold , neuner said that she was delighted with the result .
" i am very happy , it is a silver , it is great .
one mistake is good , " she said .
neuner won her first world championship in 2008 and was making her olympic debut .
she has a reputation as a fast skier but is also known for regularly missing shots .
" i was hardly nervous , very focused and looked forward to the race , " she said .
but neuner did admit to running out of strength .
" i gave everything i had , she said .
" if only i could have gone a little faster .
i lost strength in the last leg . "
doubts about winner 's fitness kuzmina , whose fitness ahead of the games had been doubtful after she broke her left hand in a training fall last year , finished the 7.5 kilometer -lrb- 4.7 miles -rrb- ski course in 19 minutes , 55.6 seconds .
she incurred one penalty point in shooting .
" i was in good shape and the skis went well , so here i am , " said kuzmina who admitted she was " surprised " to have won .
marie dorin of france took bronze , 10.9 seconds behind kuzmina on the skiing course .
germany 's other female biathlon hopefuls were less successful with simone hauswald finishing in 26th place , andrea henkel in 27th and kati wilhelm in 30th spot. rc / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 dw-tv europe live journal - news with the week we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

dw asked nigerian journalist deji idowu to shed some light on the issue . deutsche welle : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been hospitalized in saudi arabia since november last year which left africa 's most populous country without a leader for more than two months .
why has it taken so long to replace him ?
deji idowu : the constitution says , if the president is not available , he should transmit a letter to the national assembly , empowering the vice-president to act , while he is not around .
unfortunately yar 'adua did not comply with that section of the constitution .
why not ?
journalists gathered that he actually broke down in the state house and had to be carried out in emergency .
so maybe the circumstances did not give room for that orderly transfer of power .
when he got to saudi arabia he was held incommunicado with everybody .
nobody in the nigerian government could reach him .
so nobody could even say for sure if there was a letter to the national assembly , which someone probably was hiding .
it could have been a political intrigue among the different ethnic groups of this country .
but at the end everybody was fed up .
so the national assembly and the houses of assembly in the states as well decided to empower the vice-president at least to act for now , so that the country can move on .
how likely is it that jonathan has to step down again , because the constitution was not respected ?
i do n't see that as a possibility .
yar 'adua is from the northwest , from the hausa fulani region , while jonathan is from bayelsa state in the south , where we have the niger delta problems .
the niger delta militants insisted that , if anything happened to jonathan , there would be problems in nigeria .
what do we know about the president 's health ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been unable to carry out his duties for more than two months it was officially announced that he had an inflammation of the outer membrane of the heart .
that is the problem he is coping with in saudi arabia .
but we know that all along he has had kidney problems .
the complication is getting to the point that he is having multiple organ failures .
medical experts in nigeria doubt that he can get active as a president again .
the president is very sick , no doubt about that .
but we know he 's alive .
the problem is that the part of the country he comes from will still wants him to hang on to power for selfish reasons , not for the national interest .
what kind of personality is jonathan as compared to yar 'adua ?
basically i would n't say there is much difference , because they belong to the same party , the people 's democratic party .
jonathan said that he is continuing from where yar 'adua stopped .
he says he will prioritize power projects and infrastructural developments .
did n't yar 'adua make a similar announcement before he was elected in 2007 , but little has happened since ?
the problem is that , since yar 'adua took over , he has been struggling with his health .
that has slowed him down in taking decisions .
how do the people react to their acting president ?
nobody actually has criticised the reshuffle for now , but many human rights lawyers in the country are saying the national assembly is wrong not to have followed the constitution .
people from north where yar 'adua comes from , are not particularly happy .
but those from the south and the middle belt seem to believe that it is proper for jonathan to act as president .
bildunterschrift : nigeria 's military has accepted the transfer of power how did nigeria 's strong military react to the political handover ?
that is the most interesting part of the whole scenario .
when the situation was rather tense , some people feared a coup , but the military came out and said they had no intention to dabble into the political arena and that the constitution should be followed .
so the military is ready to work with whoever is commander in chief and president .

" before , you had to go to the bank and get hold of the money with a weapon .
today you can do it electronically by stealing data . " but schaeuble has said that the government would be legally justified in buying the stolen data .
chancellor angela merkel is also in favor of acquiring the cd . " in principle , the decision was made two years ago , " schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine newspaper , referring to a similar case in 2007 , when the government handed over as much as five million euros for stolen tax data from liechtenstein . rc / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.02.2010 germany 's foreign minister triggers new barrage of criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the fdp become a one-man show under westerwelle ?
after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence .

the ceremony was originally scheduled for saturday , but was pushed back as protests and demonstrations rocked the eastern german city on the anniversary of its bombing during world war ii .
the friends of dresden germany society awarded gorbachev the 25,000-euro -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- prize for his perestroika reforms , which restructured the soviet political and economic systems and paved the way for a transition to democracy across the region .
gorbachev said he was " deeply moved " by the award .
the world 's problems would only be able to be solved through dialogue , he said , adding that " we proved this was possible . "
he also called for more efforts toward a peaceful resolution of conflicts and an end to the arms race .
on saturday , right-wing and left-wing activists faced off in the city with demonstrators successfully thwarting an attempt by neo-nazis to hold a march commemorating the 65th anniversary of the allied firebombing of dresden .
the city had planned a range of activities to mark the anniversary , both to remember the dead and to focus on broader issues of war and peace. hf / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march . ' thoughtlessness and narcissism ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegelmann also appeared in jasmin tabatabai 's film " the incomplete " soon after the novel 's publication in january , blogger dave pirmasens showed that multiple parts of " axolotl roadkill " are nearly identical to passages from a lesser known novel called " strobo , " published by a berlin blogger who writes under the name airen . plagiarism complaints against hegemann have since mounted and implicate elements ranging from the novel 's title to content from a short story hegemann published . the young author admits that she plagiarized parts of the novel , seeming at times contrite but at times willful about her use of others ' material . " i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it . " the novel 's publisher is releasing a second edition of the book with credit given to airen . copyright versus the right to copy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet encouraging copyright theft ?
the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication . " no hype in the world is going to help against the charges facing the book , " wrote die zeit .
" the originality of the work is now completely dubious - regardless of whether hegemann has an idiosyncratic view of authorship or whether her approach reflects the times . " ' a gifted young woman ' but hegemann 's views have also found a degree of support among german critics , who cite changing attitudes toward use of sources as well as instances of plagiarism in renowned classics . german newsmagazine der spiegel , for example , compared " axolotl roadkill " to modernist classics like " naked lunch " by william s. burroughs and " manhattan transfer " by john dos passos .
it noted the plethora of uncited sources in these works : " everything from newspaper articles to ads to all kinds of other texts are embedded in these foundational works of literary modernism . " hegemann is also still in the running for the leipzig book fair prize . " we believe that this young woman is extremely gifted , " verena auffermann , one of the book fair 's panelists , told dpa news agency after the plagiarism was uncovered . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence .

" in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .

the ceremony was originally scheduled for saturday , but was pushed back as protests and demonstrations rocked the eastern german city on the anniversary of its bombing during world war ii .
the friends of dresden germany society awarded gorbachev the 25,000-euro -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- prize for his perestroika reforms , which restructured the soviet political and economic systems and paved the way for a transition to democracy across the region .
gorbachev said he was " deeply moved " by the award .
the world 's problems would only be able to be solved through dialogue , he said , adding that " we proved this was possible . "
he also called for more efforts toward a peaceful resolution of conflicts and an end to the arms race .
on saturday , right-wing and left-wing activists faced off in the city with demonstrators successfully thwarting an attempt by neo-nazis to hold a march commemorating the 65th anniversary of the allied firebombing of dresden .
the city had planned a range of activities to mark the anniversary , both to remember the dead and to focus on broader issues of war and peace. hf / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 14.02.2010 young german author climbs bestseller list despite plagiarism claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann questions whether copyrights may go too far where is the line between stealing someone 's words and transforming them into something new ? 17-year-old helene hegemann 's new book is raising this question , following claims that she plagiarized parts of the novel . seventeen-year-old german author helene hegemann is no stranger to the spotlight , and revelations this week have brought her more attention than ever . hegemann first stepped into the public eye three years ago with the premiere of her play " ariel 15 " at a berlin theater , and this week , her first novel climbed to second place on the german bestseller list .
the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march . ' thoughtlessness and narcissism ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegelmann also appeared in jasmin tabatabai 's film " the incomplete " soon after the novel 's publication in january , blogger dave pirmasens showed that multiple parts of " axolotl roadkill " are nearly identical to passages from a lesser known novel called " strobo , " published by a berlin blogger who writes under the name airen . plagiarism complaints against hegemann have since mounted and implicate elements ranging from the novel 's title to content from a short story hegemann published . the young author admits that she plagiarized parts of the novel , seeming at times contrite but at times willful about her use of others ' material . " i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it . " the novel 's publisher is releasing a second edition of the book with credit given to airen . copyright versus the right to copy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet encouraging copyright theft ?
the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication . " no hype in the world is going to help against the charges facing the book , " wrote die zeit .
" the originality of the work is now completely dubious - regardless of whether hegemann has an idiosyncratic view of authorship or whether her approach reflects the times . " ' a gifted young woman ' but hegemann 's views have also found a degree of support among german critics , who cite changing attitudes toward use of sources as well as instances of plagiarism in renowned classics . german newsmagazine der spiegel , for example , compared " axolotl roadkill " to modernist classics like " naked lunch " by william s. burroughs and " manhattan transfer " by john dos passos .

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .

in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .

even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 14.02.2010 postcard from europe : berlinale buzz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this bear has been going for 60 years just when you thought the german capital had had enough of anniversary celebrations , the city is unrolling its red carpets for yet another party .
alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .
for a cool 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- , the berlinale offers a fine diversion from germany 's financial woes . author : alexa dvorson editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes just a week after robbe submitted a report detailing allegations of such treatment , known as hazing , at a mountain infantry training camp in mittenwald in southern germany to the parliament 's defense policy committee .

dw asked nigerian journalist deji idowu to shed some light on the issue . deutsche welle : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been hospitalized in saudi arabia since november last year which left africa 's most populous country without a leader for more than two months .
why has it taken so long to replace him ?
deji idowu : the constitution says , if the president is not available , he should transmit a letter to the national assembly , empowering the vice-president to act , while he is not around .
unfortunately yar 'adua did not comply with that section of the constitution .
why not ?
journalists gathered that he actually broke down in the state house and had to be carried out in emergency .
so maybe the circumstances did not give room for that orderly transfer of power .
when he got to saudi arabia he was held incommunicado with everybody .
nobody in the nigerian government could reach him .
so nobody could even say for sure if there was a letter to the national assembly , which someone probably was hiding .
it could have been a political intrigue among the different ethnic groups of this country .
but at the end everybody was fed up .
so the national assembly and the houses of assembly in the states as well decided to empower the vice-president at least to act for now , so that the country can move on .
how likely is it that jonathan has to step down again , because the constitution was not respected ?
i do n't see that as a possibility .
yar 'adua is from the northwest , from the hausa fulani region , while jonathan is from bayelsa state in the south , where we have the niger delta problems .
the niger delta militants insisted that , if anything happened to jonathan , there would be problems in nigeria .
what do we know about the president 's health ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been unable to carry out his duties for more than two months it was officially announced that he had an inflammation of the outer membrane of the heart .
that is the problem he is coping with in saudi arabia .
but we know that all along he has had kidney problems .
the complication is getting to the point that he is having multiple organ failures .
medical experts in nigeria doubt that he can get active as a president again .
the president is very sick , no doubt about that .
but we know he 's alive .
the problem is that the part of the country he comes from will still wants him to hang on to power for selfish reasons , not for the national interest .
what kind of personality is jonathan as compared to yar 'adua ?
basically i would n't say there is much difference , because they belong to the same party , the people 's democratic party .
jonathan said that he is continuing from where yar 'adua stopped .
he says he will prioritize power projects and infrastructural developments .
did n't yar 'adua make a similar announcement before he was elected in 2007 , but little has happened since ?
the problem is that , since yar 'adua took over , he has been struggling with his health .
that has slowed him down in taking decisions .
how do the people react to their acting president ?
nobody actually has criticised the reshuffle for now , but many human rights lawyers in the country are saying the national assembly is wrong not to have followed the constitution .
people from north where yar 'adua comes from , are not particularly happy .
but those from the south and the middle belt seem to believe that it is proper for jonathan to act as president .
bildunterschrift : nigeria 's military has accepted the transfer of power how did nigeria 's strong military react to the political handover ?
that is the most interesting part of the whole scenario .
when the situation was rather tense , some people feared a coup , but the military came out and said they had no intention to dabble into the political arena and that the constitution should be followed .
so the military is ready to work with whoever is commander in chief and president .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .
for a cool 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- , the berlinale offers a fine diversion from germany 's financial woes . author : alexa dvorson editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out .

the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication .

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march . ' thoughtlessness and narcissism ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegelmann also appeared in jasmin tabatabai 's film " the incomplete " soon after the novel 's publication in january , blogger dave pirmasens showed that multiple parts of " axolotl roadkill " are nearly identical to passages from a lesser known novel called " strobo , " published by a berlin blogger who writes under the name airen . plagiarism complaints against hegemann have since mounted and implicate elements ranging from the novel 's title to content from a short story hegemann published . the young author admits that she plagiarized parts of the novel , seeming at times contrite but at times willful about her use of others ' material . " i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it . " the novel 's publisher is releasing a second edition of the book with credit given to airen . copyright versus the right to copy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet encouraging copyright theft ?
the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication . " no hype in the world is going to help against the charges facing the book , " wrote die zeit .
" the originality of the work is now completely dubious - regardless of whether hegemann has an idiosyncratic view of authorship or whether her approach reflects the times . " ' a gifted young woman ' but hegemann 's views have also found a degree of support among german critics , who cite changing attitudes toward use of sources as well as instances of plagiarism in renowned classics . german newsmagazine der spiegel , for example , compared " axolotl roadkill " to modernist classics like " naked lunch " by william s. burroughs and " manhattan transfer " by john dos passos .
it noted the plethora of uncited sources in these works : " everything from newspaper articles to ads to all kinds of other texts are embedded in these foundational works of literary modernism . " hegemann is also still in the running for the leipzig book fair prize . " we believe that this young woman is extremely gifted , " verena auffermann , one of the book fair 's panelists , told dpa news agency after the plagiarism was uncovered . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many senses , his five-year presidency seems to have been an era of missed chances . however , it 's not just the glorious start of his presidency - the " orange revolution " - that deserves a prominent place in ukrainian history : the end merits one as well . there 's no clearer sign that ukraine has become a healthy democracy than the fact that the incumbent president dropped out of the election race in the first round , while the opposition candidate was peacefully elected president , without yushchenko using those " administrative resources " that are so commonly employed in former soviet regions in a bid to cling to power . that 's just the kind of system that the " orange revolution " was striving for - and it 's not just his successor viktor janukovych who 's now responsible to uphold it . but yushchenko 's biggest achievement lies in sending another signal to russia and other post-soviet states .
for these countries are yet to pass that most fundamental test of democracy , namely disposing of an incumbent leader and helping an opposition candidate into power by entirely peaceful means . of course many people in russia , and elsewhere , talk about democracy , rule of law and fighting corruption , but only the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has actively shown the world what this really means in practice . author : ingo mannteufel / msh editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuzmina finished the skiing section 1.5 seconds ahead of the 23-year-old german , who also missed one target on the shooting range .
' one mistake is good ' despite being so close to her first olympic gold , neuner said that she was delighted with the result .
" i am very happy , it is a silver , it is great .
one mistake is good , " she said .
neuner won her first world championship in 2008 and was making her olympic debut .
she has a reputation as a fast skier but is also known for regularly missing shots .
" i was hardly nervous , very focused and looked forward to the race , " she said .
but neuner did admit to running out of strength .
" i gave everything i had , she said .
" if only i could have gone a little faster .
i lost strength in the last leg . "
doubts about winner 's fitness kuzmina , whose fitness ahead of the games had been doubtful after she broke her left hand in a training fall last year , finished the 7.5 kilometer -lrb- 4.7 miles -rrb- ski course in 19 minutes , 55.6 seconds .
she incurred one penalty point in shooting .
" i was in good shape and the skis went well , so here i am , " said kuzmina who admitted she was " surprised " to have won .
marie dorin of france took bronze , 10.9 seconds behind kuzmina on the skiing course .
germany 's other female biathlon hopefuls were less successful with simone hauswald finishing in 26th place , andrea henkel in 27th and kati wilhelm in 30th spot. rc / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.02.2010 human rights lawyers criticize nigeria 's presidential appointment process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria 's new acting president 's rise to power raises questions by appointing goodluck jonathan as acting president , nigeria after a two-month leadership vacuum , has solved its political crisis at least for now .
dw asked nigerian journalist deji idowu to shed some light on the issue . deutsche welle : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been hospitalized in saudi arabia since november last year which left africa 's most populous country without a leader for more than two months .
why has it taken so long to replace him ?
deji idowu : the constitution says , if the president is not available , he should transmit a letter to the national assembly , empowering the vice-president to act , while he is not around .
unfortunately yar 'adua did not comply with that section of the constitution .
why not ?
journalists gathered that he actually broke down in the state house and had to be carried out in emergency .
so maybe the circumstances did not give room for that orderly transfer of power .
when he got to saudi arabia he was held incommunicado with everybody .
nobody in the nigerian government could reach him .
so nobody could even say for sure if there was a letter to the national assembly , which someone probably was hiding .
it could have been a political intrigue among the different ethnic groups of this country .
but at the end everybody was fed up .
so the national assembly and the houses of assembly in the states as well decided to empower the vice-president at least to act for now , so that the country can move on .
how likely is it that jonathan has to step down again , because the constitution was not respected ?
i do n't see that as a possibility .
yar 'adua is from the northwest , from the hausa fulani region , while jonathan is from bayelsa state in the south , where we have the niger delta problems .
the niger delta militants insisted that , if anything happened to jonathan , there would be problems in nigeria .
what do we know about the president 's health ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been unable to carry out his duties for more than two months it was officially announced that he had an inflammation of the outer membrane of the heart .
that is the problem he is coping with in saudi arabia .
but we know that all along he has had kidney problems .
the complication is getting to the point that he is having multiple organ failures .
medical experts in nigeria doubt that he can get active as a president again .
the president is very sick , no doubt about that .
but we know he 's alive .
the problem is that the part of the country he comes from will still wants him to hang on to power for selfish reasons , not for the national interest .
what kind of personality is jonathan as compared to yar 'adua ?
basically i would n't say there is much difference , because they belong to the same party , the people 's democratic party .
jonathan said that he is continuing from where yar 'adua stopped .
he says he will prioritize power projects and infrastructural developments .
did n't yar 'adua make a similar announcement before he was elected in 2007 , but little has happened since ?
the problem is that , since yar 'adua took over , he has been struggling with his health .
that has slowed him down in taking decisions .
how do the people react to their acting president ?
nobody actually has criticised the reshuffle for now , but many human rights lawyers in the country are saying the national assembly is wrong not to have followed the constitution .
people from north where yar 'adua comes from , are not particularly happy .
but those from the south and the middle belt seem to believe that it is proper for jonathan to act as president .
bildunterschrift : nigeria 's military has accepted the transfer of power how did nigeria 's strong military react to the political handover ?
that is the most interesting part of the whole scenario .
when the situation was rather tense , some people feared a coup , but the military came out and said they had no intention to dabble into the political arena and that the constitution should be followed .
so the military is ready to work with whoever is commander in chief and president .

did n't yar 'adua make a similar announcement before he was elected in 2007 , but little has happened since ?
the problem is that , since yar 'adua took over , he has been struggling with his health .
that has slowed him down in taking decisions .
how do the people react to their acting president ?
nobody actually has criticised the reshuffle for now , but many human rights lawyers in the country are saying the national assembly is wrong not to have followed the constitution .
people from north where yar 'adua comes from , are not particularly happy .

dw asked nigerian journalist deji idowu to shed some light on the issue . deutsche welle : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been hospitalized in saudi arabia since november last year which left africa 's most populous country without a leader for more than two months .
why has it taken so long to replace him ?
deji idowu : the constitution says , if the president is not available , he should transmit a letter to the national assembly , empowering the vice-president to act , while he is not around .
unfortunately yar 'adua did not comply with that section of the constitution .
why not ?
journalists gathered that he actually broke down in the state house and had to be carried out in emergency .
so maybe the circumstances did not give room for that orderly transfer of power .
when he got to saudi arabia he was held incommunicado with everybody .
nobody in the nigerian government could reach him .
so nobody could even say for sure if there was a letter to the national assembly , which someone probably was hiding .
it could have been a political intrigue among the different ethnic groups of this country .
but at the end everybody was fed up .
so the national assembly and the houses of assembly in the states as well decided to empower the vice-president at least to act for now , so that the country can move on .
how likely is it that jonathan has to step down again , because the constitution was not respected ?
i do n't see that as a possibility .
yar 'adua is from the northwest , from the hausa fulani region , while jonathan is from bayelsa state in the south , where we have the niger delta problems .
the niger delta militants insisted that , if anything happened to jonathan , there would be problems in nigeria .
what do we know about the president 's health ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been unable to carry out his duties for more than two months it was officially announced that he had an inflammation of the outer membrane of the heart .
that is the problem he is coping with in saudi arabia .
but we know that all along he has had kidney problems .
the complication is getting to the point that he is having multiple organ failures .
medical experts in nigeria doubt that he can get active as a president again .
the president is very sick , no doubt about that .
but we know he 's alive .
the problem is that the part of the country he comes from will still wants him to hang on to power for selfish reasons , not for the national interest .
what kind of personality is jonathan as compared to yar 'adua ?
basically i would n't say there is much difference , because they belong to the same party , the people 's democratic party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 14.02.2010 young german author climbs bestseller list despite plagiarism claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann questions whether copyrights may go too far where is the line between stealing someone 's words and transforming them into something new ? 17-year-old helene hegemann 's new book is raising this question , following claims that she plagiarized parts of the novel . seventeen-year-old german author helene hegemann is no stranger to the spotlight , and revelations this week have brought her more attention than ever . hegemann first stepped into the public eye three years ago with the premiere of her play " ariel 15 " at a berlin theater , and this week , her first novel climbed to second place on the german bestseller list .
the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march . ' thoughtlessness and narcissism ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegelmann also appeared in jasmin tabatabai 's film " the incomplete " soon after the novel 's publication in january , blogger dave pirmasens showed that multiple parts of " axolotl roadkill " are nearly identical to passages from a lesser known novel called " strobo , " published by a berlin blogger who writes under the name airen . plagiarism complaints against hegemann have since mounted and implicate elements ranging from the novel 's title to content from a short story hegemann published . the young author admits that she plagiarized parts of the novel , seeming at times contrite but at times willful about her use of others ' material . " i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it . " the novel 's publisher is releasing a second edition of the book with credit given to airen . copyright versus the right to copy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet encouraging copyright theft ?
the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication . " no hype in the world is going to help against the charges facing the book , " wrote die zeit .
" the originality of the work is now completely dubious - regardless of whether hegemann has an idiosyncratic view of authorship or whether her approach reflects the times . " ' a gifted young woman ' but hegemann 's views have also found a degree of support among german critics , who cite changing attitudes toward use of sources as well as instances of plagiarism in renowned classics . german newsmagazine der spiegel , for example , compared " axolotl roadkill " to modernist classics like " naked lunch " by william s. burroughs and " manhattan transfer " by john dos passos .
it noted the plethora of uncited sources in these works : " everything from newspaper articles to ads to all kinds of other texts are embedded in these foundational works of literary modernism . " hegemann is also still in the running for the leipzig book fair prize . " we believe that this young woman is extremely gifted , " verena auffermann , one of the book fair 's panelists , told dpa news agency after the plagiarism was uncovered . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march .

" i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it .

the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication . " no hype in the world is going to help against the charges facing the book , " wrote die zeit .
" the originality of the work is now completely dubious - regardless of whether hegemann has an idiosyncratic view of authorship or whether her approach reflects the times . " ' a gifted young woman ' but hegemann 's views have also found a degree of support among german critics , who cite changing attitudes toward use of sources as well as instances of plagiarism in renowned classics . german newsmagazine der spiegel , for example , compared " axolotl roadkill " to modernist classics like " naked lunch " by william s. burroughs and " manhattan transfer " by john dos passos .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .
for a cool 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- , the berlinale offers a fine diversion from germany 's financial woes . author : alexa dvorson editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .

the country ’ s other female biathlon hopefuls did not fare nearly so well . germany 's biathlon ace magdalena neuner lost to her slovakian rival by only the narrowest of margins but claimed germany 's first medal .
neuner , who has won six world championships , picked up a silver medal while anastastiya kuzmina emerged victorious in the 7.5 kilometer sprint skiing and shooting event .
kuzmina finished the skiing section 1.5 seconds ahead of the 23-year-old german , who also missed one target on the shooting range .
' one mistake is good ' despite being so close to her first olympic gold , neuner said that she was delighted with the result .
" i am very happy , it is a silver , it is great .
one mistake is good , " she said .
neuner won her first world championship in 2008 and was making her olympic debut .
she has a reputation as a fast skier but is also known for regularly missing shots .
" i was hardly nervous , very focused and looked forward to the race , " she said .
but neuner did admit to running out of strength .
" i gave everything i had , she said .
" if only i could have gone a little faster .
i lost strength in the last leg . "

she incurred one penalty point in shooting .

the country ’ s other female biathlon hopefuls did not fare nearly so well . germany 's biathlon ace magdalena neuner lost to her slovakian rival by only the narrowest of margins but claimed germany 's first medal .
neuner , who has won six world championships , picked up a silver medal while anastastiya kuzmina emerged victorious in the 7.5 kilometer sprint skiing and shooting event .
kuzmina finished the skiing section 1.5 seconds ahead of the 23-year-old german , who also missed one target on the shooting range .

" i am very happy , it is a silver , it is great .
one mistake is good , " she said .
neuner won her first world championship in 2008 and was making her olympic debut .
she has a reputation as a fast skier but is also known for regularly missing shots .
" i was hardly nervous , very focused and looked forward to the race , " she said .

she incurred one penalty point in shooting .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 14.02.2010 young german author climbs bestseller list despite plagiarism claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann questions whether copyrights may go too far where is the line between stealing someone 's words and transforming them into something new ? 17-year-old helene hegemann 's new book is raising this question , following claims that she plagiarized parts of the novel . seventeen-year-old german author helene hegemann is no stranger to the spotlight , and revelations this week have brought her more attention than ever . hegemann first stepped into the public eye three years ago with the premiere of her play " ariel 15 " at a berlin theater , and this week , her first novel climbed to second place on the german bestseller list .
the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march . ' thoughtlessness and narcissism ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegelmann also appeared in jasmin tabatabai 's film " the incomplete " soon after the novel 's publication in january , blogger dave pirmasens showed that multiple parts of " axolotl roadkill " are nearly identical to passages from a lesser known novel called " strobo , " published by a berlin blogger who writes under the name airen . plagiarism complaints against hegemann have since mounted and implicate elements ranging from the novel 's title to content from a short story hegemann published . the young author admits that she plagiarized parts of the novel , seeming at times contrite but at times willful about her use of others ' material . " i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it . " the novel 's publisher is releasing a second edition of the book with credit given to airen . copyright versus the right to copy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet encouraging copyright theft ?
the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication . " no hype in the world is going to help against the charges facing the book , " wrote die zeit .
" the originality of the work is now completely dubious - regardless of whether hegemann has an idiosyncratic view of authorship or whether her approach reflects the times . " ' a gifted young woman ' but hegemann 's views have also found a degree of support among german critics , who cite changing attitudes toward use of sources as well as instances of plagiarism in renowned classics . german newsmagazine der spiegel , for example , compared " axolotl roadkill " to modernist classics like " naked lunch " by william s. burroughs and " manhattan transfer " by john dos passos .
it noted the plethora of uncited sources in these works : " everything from newspaper articles to ads to all kinds of other texts are embedded in these foundational works of literary modernism . " hegemann is also still in the running for the leipzig book fair prize . " we believe that this young woman is extremely gifted , " verena auffermann , one of the book fair 's panelists , told dpa news agency after the plagiarism was uncovered . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.02.2010 human rights lawyers criticize nigeria 's presidential appointment process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria 's new acting president 's rise to power raises questions by appointing goodluck jonathan as acting president , nigeria after a two-month leadership vacuum , has solved its political crisis at least for now .
dw asked nigerian journalist deji idowu to shed some light on the issue . deutsche welle : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been hospitalized in saudi arabia since november last year which left africa 's most populous country without a leader for more than two months .
why has it taken so long to replace him ?
deji idowu : the constitution says , if the president is not available , he should transmit a letter to the national assembly , empowering the vice-president to act , while he is not around .
unfortunately yar 'adua did not comply with that section of the constitution .
why not ?
journalists gathered that he actually broke down in the state house and had to be carried out in emergency .
so maybe the circumstances did not give room for that orderly transfer of power .
when he got to saudi arabia he was held incommunicado with everybody .
nobody in the nigerian government could reach him .
so nobody could even say for sure if there was a letter to the national assembly , which someone probably was hiding .
it could have been a political intrigue among the different ethnic groups of this country .
but at the end everybody was fed up .
so the national assembly and the houses of assembly in the states as well decided to empower the vice-president at least to act for now , so that the country can move on .
how likely is it that jonathan has to step down again , because the constitution was not respected ?
i do n't see that as a possibility .
yar 'adua is from the northwest , from the hausa fulani region , while jonathan is from bayelsa state in the south , where we have the niger delta problems .
the niger delta militants insisted that , if anything happened to jonathan , there would be problems in nigeria .
what do we know about the president 's health ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been unable to carry out his duties for more than two months it was officially announced that he had an inflammation of the outer membrane of the heart .
that is the problem he is coping with in saudi arabia .
but we know that all along he has had kidney problems .
the complication is getting to the point that he is having multiple organ failures .
medical experts in nigeria doubt that he can get active as a president again .
the president is very sick , no doubt about that .
but we know he 's alive .
the problem is that the part of the country he comes from will still wants him to hang on to power for selfish reasons , not for the national interest .
what kind of personality is jonathan as compared to yar 'adua ?
basically i would n't say there is much difference , because they belong to the same party , the people 's democratic party .
jonathan said that he is continuing from where yar 'adua stopped .
he says he will prioritize power projects and infrastructural developments .
did n't yar 'adua make a similar announcement before he was elected in 2007 , but little has happened since ?
the problem is that , since yar 'adua took over , he has been struggling with his health .
that has slowed him down in taking decisions .
how do the people react to their acting president ?
nobody actually has criticised the reshuffle for now , but many human rights lawyers in the country are saying the national assembly is wrong not to have followed the constitution .
people from north where yar 'adua comes from , are not particularly happy .
but those from the south and the middle belt seem to believe that it is proper for jonathan to act as president .
bildunterschrift : nigeria 's military has accepted the transfer of power how did nigeria 's strong military react to the political handover ?
that is the most interesting part of the whole scenario .
when the situation was rather tense , some people feared a coup , but the military came out and said they had no intention to dabble into the political arena and that the constitution should be followed .
so the military is ready to work with whoever is commander in chief and president .

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march . ' thoughtlessness and narcissism ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegelmann also appeared in jasmin tabatabai 's film " the incomplete " soon after the novel 's publication in january , blogger dave pirmasens showed that multiple parts of " axolotl roadkill " are nearly identical to passages from a lesser known novel called " strobo , " published by a berlin blogger who writes under the name airen . plagiarism complaints against hegemann have since mounted and implicate elements ranging from the novel 's title to content from a short story hegemann published . the young author admits that she plagiarized parts of the novel , seeming at times contrite but at times willful about her use of others ' material . " i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it . " the novel 's publisher is releasing a second edition of the book with credit given to airen . copyright versus the right to copy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet encouraging copyright theft ?
the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication . " no hype in the world is going to help against the charges facing the book , " wrote die zeit .
" the originality of the work is now completely dubious - regardless of whether hegemann has an idiosyncratic view of authorship or whether her approach reflects the times . " ' a gifted young woman ' but hegemann 's views have also found a degree of support among german critics , who cite changing attitudes toward use of sources as well as instances of plagiarism in renowned classics . german newsmagazine der spiegel , for example , compared " axolotl roadkill " to modernist classics like " naked lunch " by william s. burroughs and " manhattan transfer " by john dos passos .
it noted the plethora of uncited sources in these works : " everything from newspaper articles to ads to all kinds of other texts are embedded in these foundational works of literary modernism .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .
for a cool 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- , the berlinale offers a fine diversion from germany 's financial woes . author : alexa dvorson editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

but five new reports of similar abuse indicate a bigger problem . on sunday , germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , was quoted by the weekly mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag as saying five more soldiers had come to him with stories of forced eating , drinking and vomiting .
this comes just a week after robbe submitted a report detailing allegations of such treatment , known as hazing , at a mountain infantry training camp in mittenwald in southern germany to the parliament 's defense policy committee .
the original report came from a conscript who said he and others were forced to drink alcohol and eat raw liver until they vomited .

robbe said he would inform the defense policy committee this coming week .
robbe also told bild am sonntag that he was concerned about a general problem with alcohol abuse and over-drinking in the bundeswehr .
" i have the impression that in certain parts of the bundeswehr there 's an after-hours alcohol problem that we must fight against , " he told the newspaper .

but five new reports of similar abuse indicate a bigger problem . on sunday , germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , was quoted by the weekly mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag as saying five more soldiers had come to him with stories of forced eating , drinking and vomiting .
this comes just a week after robbe submitted a report detailing allegations of such treatment , known as hazing , at a mountain infantry training camp in mittenwald in southern germany to the parliament 's defense policy committee .
the original report came from a conscript who said he and others were forced to drink alcohol and eat raw liver until they vomited .
" after the complaint from the soldier from the mountain infantry in mittenwald , more soldiers have now come forward with reports , both from the mittenwald unit and also from other sites , " bild am sonntag quoted robbe as saying .
robbe said he would inform the defense policy committee this coming week .
robbe also told bild am sonntag that he was concerned about a general problem with alcohol abuse and over-drinking in the bundeswehr .
" i have the impression that in certain parts of the bundeswehr there 's an after-hours alcohol problem that we must fight against , " he told the newspaper .
" the reports suggest that excessive alcohol consumption played a big role .
binge drinking should absolutely not be taking place in the bundeswehr , at locations within germany and abroad . "
the munich district attorney is currently investigating one soldier on suspicion of causing intentional injury as part of the ongoing investigation into the reports of hazing. hf / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ceremony was originally scheduled for saturday , but was pushed back as protests and demonstrations rocked the eastern german city on the anniversary of its bombing during world war ii .
the friends of dresden germany society awarded gorbachev the 25,000-euro -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- prize for his perestroika reforms , which restructured the soviet political and economic systems and paved the way for a transition to democracy across the region .
gorbachev said he was " deeply moved " by the award .
the world 's problems would only be able to be solved through dialogue , he said , adding that " we proved this was possible . "
he also called for more efforts toward a peaceful resolution of conflicts and an end to the arms race .
on saturday , right-wing and left-wing activists faced off in the city with demonstrators successfully thwarting an attempt by neo-nazis to hold a march commemorating the 65th anniversary of the allied firebombing of dresden .
the city had planned a range of activities to mark the anniversary , both to remember the dead and to focus on broader issues of war and peace. hf / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many senses , his five-year presidency seems to have been an era of missed chances . however , it 's not just the glorious start of his presidency - the " orange revolution " - that deserves a prominent place in ukrainian history : the end merits one as well . there 's no clearer sign that ukraine has become a healthy democracy than the fact that the incumbent president dropped out of the election race in the first round , while the opposition candidate was peacefully elected president , without yushchenko using those " administrative resources " that are so commonly employed in former soviet regions in a bid to cling to power . that 's just the kind of system that the " orange revolution " was striving for - and it 's not just his successor viktor janukovych who 's now responsible to uphold it . but yushchenko 's biggest achievement lies in sending another signal to russia and other post-soviet states .
for these countries are yet to pass that most fundamental test of democracy , namely disposing of an incumbent leader and helping an opposition candidate into power by entirely peaceful means . of course many people in russia , and elsewhere , talk about democracy , rule of law and fighting corruption , but only the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has actively shown the world what this really means in practice . author : ingo mannteufel / msh editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .
for a cool 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- , the berlinale offers a fine diversion from germany 's financial woes . author : alexa dvorson editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 14.02.2010 young german author climbs bestseller list despite plagiarism claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann questions whether copyrights may go too far where is the line between stealing someone 's words and transforming them into something new ? 17-year-old helene hegemann 's new book is raising this question , following claims that she plagiarized parts of the novel . seventeen-year-old german author helene hegemann is no stranger to the spotlight , and revelations this week have brought her more attention than ever . hegemann first stepped into the public eye three years ago with the premiere of her play " ariel 15 " at a berlin theater , and this week , her first novel climbed to second place on the german bestseller list .
the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march . ' thoughtlessness and narcissism ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegelmann also appeared in jasmin tabatabai 's film " the incomplete " soon after the novel 's publication in january , blogger dave pirmasens showed that multiple parts of " axolotl roadkill " are nearly identical to passages from a lesser known novel called " strobo , " published by a berlin blogger who writes under the name airen . plagiarism complaints against hegemann have since mounted and implicate elements ranging from the novel 's title to content from a short story hegemann published . the young author admits that she plagiarized parts of the novel , seeming at times contrite but at times willful about her use of others ' material . " i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it . " the novel 's publisher is releasing a second edition of the book with credit given to airen . copyright versus the right to copy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet encouraging copyright theft ?
the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

dw asked nigerian journalist deji idowu to shed some light on the issue . deutsche welle : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been hospitalized in saudi arabia since november last year which left africa 's most populous country without a leader for more than two months .
why has it taken so long to replace him ?
deji idowu : the constitution says , if the president is not available , he should transmit a letter to the national assembly , empowering the vice-president to act , while he is not around .
unfortunately yar 'adua did not comply with that section of the constitution .
why not ?
journalists gathered that he actually broke down in the state house and had to be carried out in emergency .
so maybe the circumstances did not give room for that orderly transfer of power .
when he got to saudi arabia he was held incommunicado with everybody .
nobody in the nigerian government could reach him .
so nobody could even say for sure if there was a letter to the national assembly , which someone probably was hiding .
it could have been a political intrigue among the different ethnic groups of this country .
but at the end everybody was fed up .
so the national assembly and the houses of assembly in the states as well decided to empower the vice-president at least to act for now , so that the country can move on .
how likely is it that jonathan has to step down again , because the constitution was not respected ?
i do n't see that as a possibility .
yar 'adua is from the northwest , from the hausa fulani region , while jonathan is from bayelsa state in the south , where we have the niger delta problems .
the niger delta militants insisted that , if anything happened to jonathan , there would be problems in nigeria .
what do we know about the president 's health ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been unable to carry out his duties for more than two months it was officially announced that he had an inflammation of the outer membrane of the heart .
that is the problem he is coping with in saudi arabia .
but we know that all along he has had kidney problems .
the complication is getting to the point that he is having multiple organ failures .
medical experts in nigeria doubt that he can get active as a president again .
the president is very sick , no doubt about that .
but we know he 's alive .
the problem is that the part of the country he comes from will still wants him to hang on to power for selfish reasons , not for the national interest .
what kind of personality is jonathan as compared to yar 'adua ?
basically i would n't say there is much difference , because they belong to the same party , the people 's democratic party .
jonathan said that he is continuing from where yar 'adua stopped .
he says he will prioritize power projects and infrastructural developments .
did n't yar 'adua make a similar announcement before he was elected in 2007 , but little has happened since ?
the problem is that , since yar 'adua took over , he has been struggling with his health .
that has slowed him down in taking decisions .
how do the people react to their acting president ?
nobody actually has criticised the reshuffle for now , but many human rights lawyers in the country are saying the national assembly is wrong not to have followed the constitution .
people from north where yar 'adua comes from , are not particularly happy .
but those from the south and the middle belt seem to believe that it is proper for jonathan to act as president .
bildunterschrift : nigeria 's military has accepted the transfer of power how did nigeria 's strong military react to the political handover ?
that is the most interesting part of the whole scenario .
when the situation was rather tense , some people feared a coup , but the military came out and said they had no intention to dabble into the political arena and that the constitution should be followed .
so the military is ready to work with whoever is commander in chief and president .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .

the country ’ s other female biathlon hopefuls did not fare nearly so well . germany 's biathlon ace magdalena neuner lost to her slovakian rival by only the narrowest of margins but claimed germany 's first medal .
neuner , who has won six world championships , picked up a silver medal while anastastiya kuzmina emerged victorious in the 7.5 kilometer sprint skiing and shooting event .
kuzmina finished the skiing section 1.5 seconds ahead of the 23-year-old german , who also missed one target on the shooting range .
' one mistake is good ' despite being so close to her first olympic gold , neuner said that she was delighted with the result .
" i am very happy , it is a silver , it is great .
one mistake is good , " she said .
neuner won her first world championship in 2008 and was making her olympic debut .
she has a reputation as a fast skier but is also known for regularly missing shots .
" i was hardly nervous , very focused and looked forward to the race , " she said .
but neuner did admit to running out of strength .
" i gave everything i had , she said .
" if only i could have gone a little faster .
i lost strength in the last leg . "
doubts about winner 's fitness kuzmina , whose fitness ahead of the games had been doubtful after she broke her left hand in a training fall last year , finished the 7.5 kilometer -lrb- 4.7 miles -rrb- ski course in 19 minutes , 55.6 seconds .
she incurred one penalty point in shooting .
" i was in good shape and the skis went well , so here i am , " said kuzmina who admitted she was " surprised " to have won .
marie dorin of france took bronze , 10.9 seconds behind kuzmina on the skiing course .
germany 's other female biathlon hopefuls were less successful with simone hauswald finishing in 26th place , andrea henkel in 27th and kati wilhelm in 30th spot. rc / reuters / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 dw-tv europe live euromaxx - highlights of the week we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .
for a cool 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- , the berlinale offers a fine diversion from germany 's financial woes . author : alexa dvorson editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.02.2010 human rights lawyers criticize nigeria 's presidential appointment process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria 's new acting president 's rise to power raises questions by appointing goodluck jonathan as acting president , nigeria after a two-month leadership vacuum , has solved its political crisis at least for now .
dw asked nigerian journalist deji idowu to shed some light on the issue . deutsche welle : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been hospitalized in saudi arabia since november last year which left africa 's most populous country without a leader for more than two months .
why has it taken so long to replace him ?
deji idowu : the constitution says , if the president is not available , he should transmit a letter to the national assembly , empowering the vice-president to act , while he is not around .
unfortunately yar 'adua did not comply with that section of the constitution .
why not ?
journalists gathered that he actually broke down in the state house and had to be carried out in emergency .
so maybe the circumstances did not give room for that orderly transfer of power .
when he got to saudi arabia he was held incommunicado with everybody .
nobody in the nigerian government could reach him .
so nobody could even say for sure if there was a letter to the national assembly , which someone probably was hiding .
it could have been a political intrigue among the different ethnic groups of this country .
but at the end everybody was fed up .
so the national assembly and the houses of assembly in the states as well decided to empower the vice-president at least to act for now , so that the country can move on .
how likely is it that jonathan has to step down again , because the constitution was not respected ?
i do n't see that as a possibility .
yar 'adua is from the northwest , from the hausa fulani region , while jonathan is from bayelsa state in the south , where we have the niger delta problems .
the niger delta militants insisted that , if anything happened to jonathan , there would be problems in nigeria .
what do we know about the president 's health ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been unable to carry out his duties for more than two months it was officially announced that he had an inflammation of the outer membrane of the heart .
that is the problem he is coping with in saudi arabia .
but we know that all along he has had kidney problems .
the complication is getting to the point that he is having multiple organ failures .
medical experts in nigeria doubt that he can get active as a president again .
the president is very sick , no doubt about that .
but we know he 's alive .
the problem is that the part of the country he comes from will still wants him to hang on to power for selfish reasons , not for the national interest .
what kind of personality is jonathan as compared to yar 'adua ?
basically i would n't say there is much difference , because they belong to the same party , the people 's democratic party .
jonathan said that he is continuing from where yar 'adua stopped .
he says he will prioritize power projects and infrastructural developments .
did n't yar 'adua make a similar announcement before he was elected in 2007 , but little has happened since ?
the problem is that , since yar 'adua took over , he has been struggling with his health .
that has slowed him down in taking decisions .
how do the people react to their acting president ?
nobody actually has criticised the reshuffle for now , but many human rights lawyers in the country are saying the national assembly is wrong not to have followed the constitution .
people from north where yar 'adua comes from , are not particularly happy .
but those from the south and the middle belt seem to believe that it is proper for jonathan to act as president .
bildunterschrift : nigeria 's military has accepted the transfer of power how did nigeria 's strong military react to the political handover ?
that is the most interesting part of the whole scenario .
when the situation was rather tense , some people feared a coup , but the military came out and said they had no intention to dabble into the political arena and that the constitution should be followed .
so the military is ready to work with whoever is commander in chief and president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 14.02.2010 young german author climbs bestseller list despite plagiarism claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann questions whether copyrights may go too far where is the line between stealing someone 's words and transforming them into something new ? 17-year-old helene hegemann 's new book is raising this question , following claims that she plagiarized parts of the novel . seventeen-year-old german author helene hegemann is no stranger to the spotlight , and revelations this week have brought her more attention than ever . hegemann first stepped into the public eye three years ago with the premiere of her play " ariel 15 " at a berlin theater , and this week , her first novel climbed to second place on the german bestseller list .
the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march . ' thoughtlessness and narcissism ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegelmann also appeared in jasmin tabatabai 's film " the incomplete " soon after the novel 's publication in january , blogger dave pirmasens showed that multiple parts of " axolotl roadkill " are nearly identical to passages from a lesser known novel called " strobo , " published by a berlin blogger who writes under the name airen . plagiarism complaints against hegemann have since mounted and implicate elements ranging from the novel 's title to content from a short story hegemann published . the young author admits that she plagiarized parts of the novel , seeming at times contrite but at times willful about her use of others ' material . " i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it . " the novel 's publisher is releasing a second edition of the book with credit given to airen . copyright versus the right to copy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet encouraging copyright theft ?
the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication . " no hype in the world is going to help against the charges facing the book , " wrote die zeit .
" the originality of the work is now completely dubious - regardless of whether hegemann has an idiosyncratic view of authorship or whether her approach reflects the times . " ' a gifted young woman ' but hegemann 's views have also found a degree of support among german critics , who cite changing attitudes toward use of sources as well as instances of plagiarism in renowned classics . german newsmagazine der spiegel , for example , compared " axolotl roadkill " to modernist classics like " naked lunch " by william s. burroughs and " manhattan transfer " by john dos passos .
it noted the plethora of uncited sources in these works : " everything from newspaper articles to ads to all kinds of other texts are embedded in these foundational works of literary modernism . " hegemann is also still in the running for the leipzig book fair prize . " we believe that this young woman is extremely gifted , " verena auffermann , one of the book fair 's panelists , told dpa news agency after the plagiarism was uncovered . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but five new reports of similar abuse indicate a bigger problem . on sunday , germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , was quoted by the weekly mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag as saying five more soldiers had come to him with stories of forced eating , drinking and vomiting .
this comes just a week after robbe submitted a report detailing allegations of such treatment , known as hazing , at a mountain infantry training camp in mittenwald in southern germany to the parliament 's defense policy committee .
the original report came from a conscript who said he and others were forced to drink alcohol and eat raw liver until they vomited .
" after the complaint from the soldier from the mountain infantry in mittenwald , more soldiers have now come forward with reports , both from the mittenwald unit and also from other sites , " bild am sonntag quoted robbe as saying .
robbe said he would inform the defense policy committee this coming week .
robbe also told bild am sonntag that he was concerned about a general problem with alcohol abuse and over-drinking in the bundeswehr .
" i have the impression that in certain parts of the bundeswehr there 's an after-hours alcohol problem that we must fight against , " he told the newspaper .
" the reports suggest that excessive alcohol consumption played a big role .
binge drinking should absolutely not be taking place in the bundeswehr , at locations within germany and abroad . "
the munich district attorney is currently investigating one soldier on suspicion of causing intentional injury as part of the ongoing investigation into the reports of hazing. hf / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many senses , his five-year presidency seems to have been an era of missed chances . however , it 's not just the glorious start of his presidency - the " orange revolution " - that deserves a prominent place in ukrainian history : the end merits one as well . there 's no clearer sign that ukraine has become a healthy democracy than the fact that the incumbent president dropped out of the election race in the first round , while the opposition candidate was peacefully elected president , without yushchenko using those " administrative resources " that are so commonly employed in former soviet regions in a bid to cling to power . that 's just the kind of system that the " orange revolution " was striving for - and it 's not just his successor viktor janukovych who 's now responsible to uphold it . but yushchenko 's biggest achievement lies in sending another signal to russia and other post-soviet states .
for these countries are yet to pass that most fundamental test of democracy , namely disposing of an incumbent leader and helping an opposition candidate into power by entirely peaceful means . of course many people in russia , and elsewhere , talk about democracy , rule of law and fighting corruption , but only the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has actively shown the world what this really means in practice . author : ingo mannteufel / msh editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

" pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

the country ’ s other female biathlon hopefuls did not fare nearly so well . germany 's biathlon ace magdalena neuner lost to her slovakian rival by only the narrowest of margins but claimed germany 's first medal .
neuner , who has won six world championships , picked up a silver medal while anastastiya kuzmina emerged victorious in the 7.5 kilometer sprint skiing and shooting event .
kuzmina finished the skiing section 1.5 seconds ahead of the 23-year-old german , who also missed one target on the shooting range .
' one mistake is good ' despite being so close to her first olympic gold , neuner said that she was delighted with the result .
" i am very happy , it is a silver , it is great .
one mistake is good , " she said .
neuner won her first world championship in 2008 and was making her olympic debut .
she has a reputation as a fast skier but is also known for regularly missing shots .
" i was hardly nervous , very focused and looked forward to the race , " she said .
but neuner did admit to running out of strength .
" i gave everything i had , she said .
" if only i could have gone a little faster .
i lost strength in the last leg . "

she incurred one penalty point in shooting .
" i was in good shape and the skis went well , so here i am , " said kuzmina who admitted she was " surprised " to have won .

the country ’ s other female biathlon hopefuls did not fare nearly so well . germany 's biathlon ace magdalena neuner lost to her slovakian rival by only the narrowest of margins but claimed germany 's first medal .
neuner , who has won six world championships , picked up a silver medal while anastastiya kuzmina emerged victorious in the 7.5 kilometer sprint skiing and shooting event .
kuzmina finished the skiing section 1.5 seconds ahead of the 23-year-old german , who also missed one target on the shooting range .
' one mistake is good ' despite being so close to her first olympic gold , neuner said that she was delighted with the result .
" i am very happy , it is a silver , it is great .
one mistake is good , " she said .
neuner won her first world championship in 2008 and was making her olympic debut .
she has a reputation as a fast skier but is also known for regularly missing shots .
" i was hardly nervous , very focused and looked forward to the race , " she said .
but neuner did admit to running out of strength .
" i gave everything i had , she said .
" if only i could have gone a little faster .
i lost strength in the last leg . "

she incurred one penalty point in shooting .
" i was in good shape and the skis went well , so here i am , " said kuzmina who admitted she was " surprised " to have won .
marie dorin of france took bronze , 10.9 seconds behind kuzmina on the skiing course .

" if germany buys stolen bank data , we will work for a change in the law so that the complete swiss accounts of german people holding public office have to be disclosed , " he said . heer is head of the right-wing svp in the canton of zurich and president of the switzerland 's taxpayers ' federation . thousands of names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is believed to be losing millions of euros to tax evasion switzerland is concerned about germany 's intent to buy a stolen disc containing names of 1,500 people with swiss accounts who may have evaded german taxation . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said at the beginning of february that germany was prepared to pay 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- for the disc . the german state of baden-wuerttemberg has been offered a second disc containing 2,000 names , which according to german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau includes information from bank groups ubs and credit suisse . rising tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax affair has inflamed passions in switzerland and provoked anti-german sentiments the tax data affair has soured relations between germany and its alpine neighbor , which sees the purchasing of the disc as another attack on its cherished banking secrecy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.02.2010 germany 's foreign minister triggers new barrage of criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the fdp become a one-man show under westerwelle ?
after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .
even the relative dissident andreas pinkwart praised his party leader 's bravery . pinkwart said westerwelle 's comments on hartz iv voiced " what the millions of german workers and middle class people , who keep things running day after day , are really thinking .

after getting blasted over his views on welfare , germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is now facing a different kind of criticism - that his pro-business free democratic party has turned into a one-man show . " party leadership needs to be more of a team game , " vice-chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , andreas pinkwart said in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the fdp needs to have more faces in the public sphere . " pinkwart suggested a few colleagues - including his superior , party chairman christian lindner , and former foreign minister hans dietrich genscher - as examples of fdp politicians who could handle greater responsibility . the fdp is losing ground hand over fist in opinion polls , and party leader guido westerwelle is on the defensive after his controversial criticism of a recent constitutional court ruling that the german welfare system does n't do enough to help the long-term unemployed . the party 's loss of seven percentage points - almost half of its support - in opinion polls since september 's general election show that voters are currently " very disappointed with the fdp , " pinkwart said . westerwelle fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is one of germany 's most visible politicians the february survey also showed that only 25 percent of people think the new coalition between chancellor merkel 's christian democrats and the fdp is performing better than the former " grand coalition " of the christian democrats and social democrats .
meanwhile , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the former administration had performed better . westerwelle , facing a torrent of criticism from opposing parties as well , has defended his earlier comments , where he stated that promising people prosperity even if they did n't work for it would encourage germans to indulge in " latter-day roman decadence . " " someone who works must have more than someone who does n't , " westerwelle told the german daily die welt .
" you 've got to be allowed to say that .
anything else would be socialism . " the german constitutional court ruled that germany 's welfare system for the long-term unemployed , hartz iv , did not provide enough money to keep people above the poverty line .
essentially , the court judged that hartz iv payments were insufficient to uphold human rights , and should therefore be increased . " the people criticizing me most loudly are the ones who botched hartz iv in the first place , " westerwelle told the mass-publication sunday tabloid bild am sonntag .
" at the end of the day , hartz iv is the brainchild of the social democrats and the greens , " he said , referring to the coalition which ruled germany from 1998 until 2005 . critics spare no words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has distanced herself from westerwelle 's views on welware perhaps the harshest criticism of westerwelle has come from the former party chairman of the christian democrats , heiner geissler , who picked up on the fdp leader 's reference to roman opulence . " latter-day roman decadence was symbolized by the super rich who , after enjoying their hedonistic feasts , bathed in ass ' milk and then named emperor caligula - an ass - as their consul . " in the interview with newspaper die welt , geissler went on to say foreign minister westerwelle 's analogy was therefore true , insofar as " an ass became foreign minister " 100 days ago . westerwelle 's own party , however , has closed ranks on this issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 14.02.2010 young german author climbs bestseller list despite plagiarism claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann questions whether copyrights may go too far where is the line between stealing someone 's words and transforming them into something new ? 17-year-old helene hegemann 's new book is raising this question , following claims that she plagiarized parts of the novel . seventeen-year-old german author helene hegemann is no stranger to the spotlight , and revelations this week have brought her more attention than ever . hegemann first stepped into the public eye three years ago with the premiere of her play " ariel 15 " at a berlin theater , and this week , her first novel climbed to second place on the german bestseller list .
the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march . ' thoughtlessness and narcissism ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegelmann also appeared in jasmin tabatabai 's film " the incomplete " soon after the novel 's publication in january , blogger dave pirmasens showed that multiple parts of " axolotl roadkill " are nearly identical to passages from a lesser known novel called " strobo , " published by a berlin blogger who writes under the name airen . plagiarism complaints against hegemann have since mounted and implicate elements ranging from the novel 's title to content from a short story hegemann published . the young author admits that she plagiarized parts of the novel , seeming at times contrite but at times willful about her use of others ' material . " i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it . " the novel 's publisher is releasing a second edition of the book with credit given to airen . copyright versus the right to copy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet encouraging copyright theft ?
the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication . " no hype in the world is going to help against the charges facing the book , " wrote die zeit .
" the originality of the work is now completely dubious - regardless of whether hegemann has an idiosyncratic view of authorship or whether her approach reflects the times . " ' a gifted young woman ' but hegemann 's views have also found a degree of support among german critics , who cite changing attitudes toward use of sources as well as instances of plagiarism in renowned classics . german newsmagazine der spiegel , for example , compared " axolotl roadkill " to modernist classics like " naked lunch " by william s. burroughs and " manhattan transfer " by john dos passos .
it noted the plethora of uncited sources in these works : " everything from newspaper articles to ads to all kinds of other texts are embedded in these foundational works of literary modernism . " hegemann is also still in the running for the leipzig book fair prize . " we believe that this young woman is extremely gifted , " verena auffermann , one of the book fair 's panelists , told dpa news agency after the plagiarism was uncovered . author : greg wiser editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .

the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .
with 400 films and over a quarter of a million tickets sold , the eleven-day event is a world unto itself - a cinematic lens to zoom in on the rest of the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexa dvorson says the berlinale has matured impressively in 1971 , a german film with gay subject matter caused a scandal ; today , gay and lesbian films have their own prize category at the festival 's awards ceremony . once chided for not being international enough , the festival is screening films from 130 countries this year .
even neighborhood movie houses , whose earnings always shrink during the film festival , will be red-carpet venues this year . all this requires supreme organization and a lot of legwork .
when a reporter asks about the festival 's funding , kosslick responds with a swabian saying : " when the candles cost more than the birthday cake , you have to reconsider a bit . " but thanks to some new sponsors , the candles have been lit .
for a cool 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- , the berlinale offers a fine diversion from germany 's financial woes . author : alexa dvorson editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the book " axolotl roadkill " follows a teenage girl who lives a life of sex and drugs in berlin 's nightclubs instead of going to school . the novel 's protagonist shares at least superficial similarities with the young author .
after her mother 's death , hegemann moved to berlin to live with her father , an established theater director and professor .
hegemann left school early after receiving the diploma conferred for completing the tenth grade . hegemann told deutsche welle that the novel is not an autobiography , though .
she said , " i just find the book entertaining .
in literature - and in all forms of art - it 's possible to experience things which you 'd have to bear the consequences for if you were to actually live them out . " but " axolotl roadkill " has gotten less attention lately for its racy content than for allegations that hegemann plagiarized passages from multiple sources .
the claims follow a flurry of critical praise for the book and its nomination for a prize at the leipzig book fair in march .

" i think there are good ethical grounds for giving sources for a book - and the fact that i neglected to do so reflects my thoughtlessness and my narcissism , " hegemann said in an interview with die welt , adding , " but for me personally , it doesn ’ t matter at all where people get their material - what matters is what they do with it .

the controversy facing hegemann touches on the broader issue of how the internet generation relates to and uses content they find on the web .
many school and university officials in recent years have raised questions about how to deal with students ' plagiarism of internet sources . hegemann has said she supports a shift away from copyrights and toward a right to copy . " if my novel is interpreted as representing our time , then it has to be recognized that the novel was created in accord with what we saw in the last decade - that is , with the rejection of all of these copyright excesses and the embrace of a right to copy and to transform , " hegemann told die welt . meanwhile , though , many critics in germany have taken a critical stance toward hegemann 's views on copyright and even overturned some of the praise the book received upon its publication .

dw asked nigerian journalist deji idowu to shed some light on the issue . deutsche welle : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been hospitalized in saudi arabia since november last year which left africa 's most populous country without a leader for more than two months .
why has it taken so long to replace him ?
deji idowu : the constitution says , if the president is not available , he should transmit a letter to the national assembly , empowering the vice-president to act , while he is not around .
unfortunately yar 'adua did not comply with that section of the constitution .
why not ?
journalists gathered that he actually broke down in the state house and had to be carried out in emergency .
so maybe the circumstances did not give room for that orderly transfer of power .
when he got to saudi arabia he was held incommunicado with everybody .
nobody in the nigerian government could reach him .
so nobody could even say for sure if there was a letter to the national assembly , which someone probably was hiding .
it could have been a political intrigue among the different ethnic groups of this country .
but at the end everybody was fed up .
so the national assembly and the houses of assembly in the states as well decided to empower the vice-president at least to act for now , so that the country can move on .
how likely is it that jonathan has to step down again , because the constitution was not respected ?
i do n't see that as a possibility .
yar 'adua is from the northwest , from the hausa fulani region , while jonathan is from bayelsa state in the south , where we have the niger delta problems .
the niger delta militants insisted that , if anything happened to jonathan , there would be problems in nigeria .
what do we know about the president 's health ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been unable to carry out his duties for more than two months it was officially announced that he had an inflammation of the outer membrane of the heart .
that is the problem he is coping with in saudi arabia .
but we know that all along he has had kidney problems .
the complication is getting to the point that he is having multiple organ failures .
medical experts in nigeria doubt that he can get active as a president again .
the president is very sick , no doubt about that .
but we know he 's alive .
the problem is that the part of the country he comes from will still wants him to hang on to power for selfish reasons , not for the national interest .
what kind of personality is jonathan as compared to yar 'adua ?
basically i would n't say there is much difference , because they belong to the same party , the people 's democratic party .
jonathan said that he is continuing from where yar 'adua stopped .
he says he will prioritize power projects and infrastructural developments .
did n't yar 'adua make a similar announcement before he was elected in 2007 , but little has happened since ?
the problem is that , since yar 'adua took over , he has been struggling with his health .
that has slowed him down in taking decisions .
how do the people react to their acting president ?
nobody actually has criticised the reshuffle for now , but many human rights lawyers in the country are saying the national assembly is wrong not to have followed the constitution .
people from north where yar 'adua comes from , are not particularly happy .
but those from the south and the middle belt seem to believe that it is proper for jonathan to act as president .
bildunterschrift : nigeria 's military has accepted the transfer of power how did nigeria 's strong military react to the political handover ?
that is the most interesting part of the whole scenario .
when the situation was rather tense , some people feared a coup , but the military came out and said they had no intention to dabble into the political arena and that the constitution should be followed .
so the military is ready to work with whoever is commander in chief and president .

alexa dvorson has this postcard on the 60th berlin film festival . an unusually harsh winter has turned most of berlin 's sidewalks into uneven ice rinks that people tread at their peril .
the scores of resulting injuries have been front-page news in the local papers . but that did n't stop a brigade of reporters from packing a pressroom on a recent monday morning .
it was standing room only as a thousand souls gathered for this year 's first news conference of the berlinale , one of the world 's highest-profile film festivals .
the way the blitzing cameras clustered around the speakers , you 'd think george clooney had just walked in .
before festival director dieter kosslick and his team of coordinators announced this year 's coming attractions , we were treated to a short film montage celebrating sixty years of the festival with all its inherent contradictions . black-and-white footage from the late 1950s shows a post-war berlin still knee-deep in rubble and guilt , yet determined to define itself as " a window to the free world . "
an ebullient mayor willy brandt inaugurates the film festival in triumphant spirit , proclaiming , " berlin will live ! "
as locals swoon at movie stars wandering through town without limousines or bodyguards , an excited news anchor declares the berlinale a people 's film festival where audiences , and not just juries , can vote for their favorite movie . when brandt served as german chancellor during the cold war , his open-door policy helped the berlinale anchor itself as a platform for east-west dialogue , a tradition that still endures in a united europe .
add the buzz of celebrity culture , and you get a curious cocktail . red carpet city when the archived snippets gave way to a chapter dubbed " vanity fair , " a few movie stars played themselves : sheer icons of egotism .
in one outtake , a subtitled french actor declares , " since my mother blessed me with such good looks , i would have been a fool not to pursue a film career . " cut to a clip of jack nicholson , who extolls the aesthetics of his derrière and suggests a rear-end shot for a poster about his latest film . vanity aside , the berlinale is a serious undertaking , and it 's matured impressively in 60 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.02.2010 human rights lawyers criticize nigeria 's presidential appointment process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria 's new acting president 's rise to power raises questions by appointing goodluck jonathan as acting president , nigeria after a two-month leadership vacuum , has solved its political crisis at least for now .
dw asked nigerian journalist deji idowu to shed some light on the issue . deutsche welle : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been hospitalized in saudi arabia since november last year which left africa 's most populous country without a leader for more than two months .
why has it taken so long to replace him ?
deji idowu : the constitution says , if the president is not available , he should transmit a letter to the national assembly , empowering the vice-president to act , while he is not around .
unfortunately yar 'adua did not comply with that section of the constitution .
why not ?
journalists gathered that he actually broke down in the state house and had to be carried out in emergency .
so maybe the circumstances did not give room for that orderly transfer of power .
when he got to saudi arabia he was held incommunicado with everybody .
nobody in the nigerian government could reach him .
so nobody could even say for sure if there was a letter to the national assembly , which someone probably was hiding .
it could have been a political intrigue among the different ethnic groups of this country .
but at the end everybody was fed up .
so the national assembly and the houses of assembly in the states as well decided to empower the vice-president at least to act for now , so that the country can move on .
how likely is it that jonathan has to step down again , because the constitution was not respected ?
i do n't see that as a possibility .
yar 'adua is from the northwest , from the hausa fulani region , while jonathan is from bayelsa state in the south , where we have the niger delta problems .
the niger delta militants insisted that , if anything happened to jonathan , there would be problems in nigeria .
what do we know about the president 's health ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president umaru musa yar 'adua has been unable to carry out his duties for more than two months it was officially announced that he had an inflammation of the outer membrane of the heart .
that is the problem he is coping with in saudi arabia .
but we know that all along he has had kidney problems .
the complication is getting to the point that he is having multiple organ failures .
medical experts in nigeria doubt that he can get active as a president again .
the president is very sick , no doubt about that .
but we know he 's alive .
the problem is that the part of the country he comes from will still wants him to hang on to power for selfish reasons , not for the national interest .
what kind of personality is jonathan as compared to yar 'adua ?
basically i would n't say there is much difference , because they belong to the same party , the people 's democratic party .
jonathan said that he is continuing from where yar 'adua stopped .
he says he will prioritize power projects and infrastructural developments .
did n't yar 'adua make a similar announcement before he was elected in 2007 , but little has happened since ?
the problem is that , since yar 'adua took over , he has been struggling with his health .
that has slowed him down in taking decisions .
how do the people react to their acting president ?
nobody actually has criticised the reshuffle for now , but many human rights lawyers in the country are saying the national assembly is wrong not to have followed the constitution .
people from north where yar 'adua comes from , are not particularly happy .
but those from the south and the middle belt seem to believe that it is proper for jonathan to act as president .
bildunterschrift : nigeria 's military has accepted the transfer of power how did nigeria 's strong military react to the political handover ?

when the situation was rather tense , some people feared a coup , but the military came out and said they had no intention to dabble into the political arena and that the constitution should be followed .
so the military is ready to work with whoever is commander in chief and president .
