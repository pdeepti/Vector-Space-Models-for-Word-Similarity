the 22-year-old rising star , driving for the red bull team , picked up where he left off last season , when he won the closing race in abu dhabi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull 's vettel is looking to be no. 1 it was bad news for seven-time world champion schumacher , who now finds himself starting four rows back from vettel in sunday 's final , with plenty of other heavyweights still in front of him .
after qualifying , schumacher admitted that he had found it hard to reach peak performance , but said he was happy that his team was working well .
" it is a long race and the season is even longer , " he said .
strong german debut starting next to vettel in second is brazilian felipe massa , with his ferrari colleague , spaniard fernando alonso , one row behind , in third .
britain 's lewis hamilton in a mclaren will be starting fourth and schumacher 's german teammate , nico rosberg , is fifth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes is banking on homegrown talent rounding out the top ten are mark webber in the second red bull car in sixth , reigning world champion jenson button for mclaren in eighth , renault 's robert kubica in ninth and german adrian sutil for force india in tenth .
for ferrari , schumacher 's former employer , it was a solid start to the season after last year 's dreadful beginning .
the italians , with massa and alonso , look set to give vettel - and schumacher - a run for their money .
in fact , no one seemed terribly impressed by schumacher 's performance , but then again , everyone also knows that he is one of the toughest competitors the sport ever had .
and , with four germans in the top ten for sunday 's final , chances are that at least one of them will be finishing on the podium. gb / dpa / afp / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .
" time is running out , so i 'm sure this is going to be something that we 'll deal with , if the un security council fails , when we have our eu foreign ministers meeting , " the finnish minister said .
he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .
without going into detail , stubb said that member states had suggested a variety of supplemental sanctions which included restrictions in the energy and financial sectors. gb / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 13.03.2010 vatican says bid to link pope to abuse has failed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican claims there 's a campaign to discredit the pope the vatican has dismissed attempts to link pope benedict xvi to a raft of child sex abuse revelations in germany , denying accusations that he had once tried to cover up the actions of pedophile priests . in a reaction to the widening pedophile scandal in germany , the vatican has rallied around the pontiff , claiming that " certain elements " had launched a targeted campaign to discredit the catholic church .
" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .

the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .

the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .

the 22-year-old rising star , driving for the red bull team , picked up where he left off last season , when he won the closing race in abu dhabi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull 's vettel is looking to be no. 1 it was bad news for seven-time world champion schumacher , who now finds himself starting four rows back from vettel in sunday 's final , with plenty of other heavyweights still in front of him .
after qualifying , schumacher admitted that he had found it hard to reach peak performance , but said he was happy that his team was working well .
" it is a long race and the season is even longer , " he said .
strong german debut starting next to vettel in second is brazilian felipe massa , with his ferrari colleague , spaniard fernando alonso , one row behind , in third .
britain 's lewis hamilton in a mclaren will be starting fourth and schumacher 's german teammate , nico rosberg , is fifth .

for ferrari , schumacher 's former employer , it was a solid start to the season after last year 's dreadful beginning .
the italians , with massa and alonso , look set to give vettel - and schumacher - a run for their money .
in fact , no one seemed terribly impressed by schumacher 's performance , but then again , everyone also knows that he is one of the toughest competitors the sport ever had .
and , with four germans in the top ten for sunday 's final , chances are that at least one of them will be finishing on the podium. gb / dpa / afp / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tourism - berlin style " many of those ravers who come to berlin know more about the subculture than the people who live in this city , " says rapp .
" they have a specific image in their head .
and by partying they themselves turn that image into reality - they are ' berlin ' even if they are n't germans . "
berlin has become an international metropolis .
the city is no longer merely the place where the wall came down , or the former capital of hitler 's regime .
it also is the destination for countless people who want to party in one of the hundreds of clubs .
this kind of tourism is different from regular mass tourism .
it 's about the individual 's quest to find something unique and special .
and it seems that berlin is at the forefront of this new trend .

" we are happy because we got an important victory .

stuttgart had most of the possession during the first half , but some superb saves from schalke goalkeeper manual neuer denied several goal scoring opportunities by stuttgart 's pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic .
brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .

schalke are now on 54 points , one point ahead of bayern munich , who can recapture the lead when they host freiburg on saturday .
stuttgart remain in seventh place with 35 points .
" we are happy because we got an important victory .
but we must continue to work hard .
i hope we can play in the same way as today in the next games , " said former germany striker kuranyi .
stuttgart had most of the possession during the first half , but some superb saves from schalke goalkeeper manual neuer denied several goal scoring opportunities by stuttgart 's pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic .
brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .
goalkeeper jens lehmann had no chance of stopping the schalke onslaught .
but tasci made up for his blunder four minutes later when he headed the 1-1 equalizer .
stuttgart tried to play the offside trap but ivan rakitic 's cross found schalke captain heiko westermann , who gave kuranyi an easy tap in to score the winner .
bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi scores his 14th goal of the season schalke coach felix magath played down his team 's title chances after the game , but their current winning streak at this stage of the season speaks volumes .
his former side wolfsburg went top of the table at a similar stage last season and went on to win the championship .
" my team played as it always does .
more controlled in the first half and more energetic in the second , " magath told reporters .
" but we can thank -lrb- goalkeeper -rrb- manuel neuer that we did n't concede in the first half .
after we took the lead we failed to put more pressure on .
we were lucky to get away with a win . "
schalke have now won their last eight home matches and kuranyi 's 14th league goal of the season makes him the bundesliga 's joint top goalscorer along with bayer leverkusen 's stefan kiessling .
but magath knows that with matches scheduled against hamburg , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich in the coming weeks the stuttgart match will be a hard act to follow. nrt / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel has defended her foreign minister . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle pronounced his whirlwind tour of south america a success on saturday , despite criticism in germany that he combined his official diplomatic trip with personal interests .
shortly before his return to berlin , the foreign minister said his four-country tour , which he wrapped up friday in brazil , was a success for " foreign policy , economic and academic relations and for cultural politics . "
westerwelle , a member of the pro-business free democratic party , was heavily criticized for bringing along his partner , michael mronz , on his latest trip to latin america .
critics accused mronz of allegedly pursuing business opportunities in the sporting events industry .
a business partner of westerwelle 's brother was also part of a delegation to asia earlier this year .
controversy continues green party chairwoman claudia roth accused westerwelle of favoritism .

for berlin , relegation is getting ever more likely . arjen robben on saturday saved bayern munich with two goals to bring the team back to the top of the bundesliga standings , a spot they had lost to schalke a day earlier .
bayern beat freiburg 2-1 , but for some time it looked as if munich was having a hard time getting those three points . cedrick makiadi put freiburg ahead half an hour into the match and bayern fans had to wait until the 76th minute to see robben level the score with a free kick from just outside the penalty area .
seven minutes later , freiburg 's ivica banovic upended thomas mueller - and robben smashed home the ensuing penalty sealing bayern 's victory .
" he is scoring goals and making them , " bayern 's coach louis van gaal said after the game .
" it 's incredible what he is doing this season and i am just glad we have him at bayern . "
munich is now on top at 56 points , ahead of schalke with 54 , who beat stuttgart on friday .

after the final whistle , berlin fans were so irate that some 100 stormed the pitch armed with flag poles .
it took police to prevent them from getting to the dressing rooms to vent their anger at the players .
berlin now is at the bottom of the table , five points adrift of freiburg and eight behind hanover .
in other games on saturday , dortmund climbed to fourth overall by hammering neighbors bochum 4-1 .

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .
" time is running out , so i 'm sure this is going to be something that we 'll deal with , if the un security council fails , when we have our eu foreign ministers meeting , " the finnish minister said .
he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .
without going into detail , stubb said that member states had suggested a variety of supplemental sanctions which included restrictions in the energy and financial sectors. gb / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .
technical work is ongoing and has not yet been concluded .
all the rest is speculation . " smh / nrt / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 13.03.2010 vatican says bid to link pope to abuse has failed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican claims there 's a campaign to discredit the pope the vatican has dismissed attempts to link pope benedict xvi to a raft of child sex abuse revelations in germany , denying accusations that he had once tried to cover up the actions of pedophile priests . in a reaction to the widening pedophile scandal in germany , the vatican has rallied around the pontiff , claiming that " certain elements " had launched a targeted campaign to discredit the catholic church .
" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schalke are now on 54 points , one point ahead of bayern munich , who can recapture the lead when they host freiburg on saturday .
stuttgart remain in seventh place with 35 points .
" we are happy because we got an important victory .
but we must continue to work hard .
i hope we can play in the same way as today in the next games , " said former germany striker kuranyi .
stuttgart had most of the possession during the first half , but some superb saves from schalke goalkeeper manual neuer denied several goal scoring opportunities by stuttgart 's pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic .
brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .
goalkeeper jens lehmann had no chance of stopping the schalke onslaught .
but tasci made up for his blunder four minutes later when he headed the 1-1 equalizer .
stuttgart tried to play the offside trap but ivan rakitic 's cross found schalke captain heiko westermann , who gave kuranyi an easy tap in to score the winner .
bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi scores his 14th goal of the season schalke coach felix magath played down his team 's title chances after the game , but their current winning streak at this stage of the season speaks volumes .
his former side wolfsburg went top of the table at a similar stage last season and went on to win the championship .
" my team played as it always does .
more controlled in the first half and more energetic in the second , " magath told reporters .
" but we can thank -lrb- goalkeeper -rrb- manuel neuer that we did n't concede in the first half .
after we took the lead we failed to put more pressure on .
we were lucky to get away with a win . "
schalke have now won their last eight home matches and kuranyi 's 14th league goal of the season makes him the bundesliga 's joint top goalscorer along with bayer leverkusen 's stefan kiessling .
but magath knows that with matches scheduled against hamburg , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich in the coming weeks the stuttgart match will be a hard act to follow. nrt / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 22-year-old rising star , driving for the red bull team , picked up where he left off last season , when he won the closing race in abu dhabi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull 's vettel is looking to be no. 1 it was bad news for seven-time world champion schumacher , who now finds himself starting four rows back from vettel in sunday 's final , with plenty of other heavyweights still in front of him .
after qualifying , schumacher admitted that he had found it hard to reach peak performance , but said he was happy that his team was working well .
" it is a long race and the season is even longer , " he said .
strong german debut starting next to vettel in second is brazilian felipe massa , with his ferrari colleague , spaniard fernando alonso , one row behind , in third .
britain 's lewis hamilton in a mclaren will be starting fourth and schumacher 's german teammate , nico rosberg , is fifth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes is banking on homegrown talent rounding out the top ten are mark webber in the second red bull car in sixth , reigning world champion jenson button for mclaren in eighth , renault 's robert kubica in ninth and german adrian sutil for force india in tenth .
for ferrari , schumacher 's former employer , it was a solid start to the season after last year 's dreadful beginning .
the italians , with massa and alonso , look set to give vettel - and schumacher - a run for their money .
in fact , no one seemed terribly impressed by schumacher 's performance , but then again , everyone also knows that he is one of the toughest competitors the sport ever had .
and , with four germans in the top ten for sunday 's final , chances are that at least one of them will be finishing on the podium. gb / dpa / afp / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven minutes later , freiburg 's ivica banovic upended thomas mueller - and robben smashed home the ensuing penalty sealing bayern 's victory .
" he is scoring goals and making them , " bayern 's coach louis van gaal said after the game .

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .

every weekend , thousands of tourists come to berlin 's famous nightclubs and experience a city which is unique in europe and around the world . a list of must-see places in berlin has always included the brandenburg gate , the reichstag , museum island , and parts of the former berlin wall .
however , now that over half the tourists coming to berlin are under 40 - around a third even younger than 30 - berlin 's nightclubs are becoming just as popular as the city 's tourist attractions .
in clubs like berghain , watergate , bar 25 , wmf , or weekend , music from the world 's most famous - and expensive - djs provides the soundtrack for the 15,000 tourists that come to party in the german capital every weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the young , techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall in 1989 these nightclub tourists come to berlin to experience a unique nightlife subculture .
they arrive with low budget airlines and , having passed safely through customs , head straight to the famous clubs .
take the berghain for instance .
what was a power plant 20 years ago is now a place where you can party till you drop .
more than two thirds of the guests are from outside germany .
illegal was in according to a british music magazine , ten of the best 100 clubs worldwide are in berlin .
and over the last years berlin has grown increasingly international - especially in its club scene .
" that 's what is driving this city forward and what has changed the city , " said tobias rapp , author and journalist for germany 's spiegel news magazine .
he has been following berlin 's rise to its status as a nightclub capital .
after the fall of the wall , young people discovered the eastern part of the city , which at that time was run down and neglected .
people used old basements and abandoned houses for parties .
there was plenty of space just waiting to be discovered , recalls thomas andrezak - also known as dj tanith .
he moved to berlin in 1987 and was among those who founded the legendary tresor club in the underground vaults of a former department store .
bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of nightclub tourists descend on berlin every weekend " it really was a place of adventure and you never knew what you 'd discover , " he said .
" when we found these underground rooms for the tresor , the place was full of old stuff , there were old russian posters from the 1960s .
it looked as if had been abandoned for decades . "
the key slogan at that time was : illegal .
no one cared about regulations , laws or property rights .
but illegal did n't necessarily mean that something was actually forbidden - it was a term used to describe a certain aesthetic approach .
new ideas emerged from those new found spaces .
art , music , fashion and design were blended together - and the underground avant-garde of the 1990s began .
it was a time for experiments .
" ' illegal ' was the term we used to describe taking over spaces that no else cared about , " said dj tanith .
" techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall - it was the music played in illegal clubs till the early hours of the morning . "
free and wild now a thing of the past but the club scene has changed .
the days of illegal parties in rundown buildings are over .
investors have moved in and clubbing has become big business .
by now , the sector is generating huge profits and the revenues are significant to the city - and so are the jobs provided .
currently around 10,000 people are employed in the sector , and it is estimated this number will increase threefold in the coming years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is actively trying to promote its image as party capital for years , the clubs had to struggle with the city 's authorities to survive .
but now berlin has realized that its famous nightlife is a major asset for the city and a unique opportunity .
today , it 's actively promoted in the city 's image campaigns .
things might have been toned down since the wild days of illegal parties 20 years ago , but berlin remains one of europe 's places to be when it comes to nightlife and clubbing .
tourism - berlin style " many of those ravers who come to berlin know more about the subculture than the people who live in this city , " says rapp .
" they have a specific image in their head .
and by partying they themselves turn that image into reality - they are ' berlin ' even if they are n't germans . "
berlin has become an international metropolis .
the city is no longer merely the place where the wall came down , or the former capital of hitler 's regime .
it also is the destination for countless people who want to party in one of the hundreds of clubs .
this kind of tourism is different from regular mass tourism .
it 's about the individual 's quest to find something unique and special .
and it seems that berlin is at the forefront of this new trend .

schalke are now on 54 points , one point ahead of bayern munich , who can recapture the lead when they host freiburg on saturday .
stuttgart remain in seventh place with 35 points .
" we are happy because we got an important victory .
but we must continue to work hard .
i hope we can play in the same way as today in the next games , " said former germany striker kuranyi .
stuttgart had most of the possession during the first half , but some superb saves from schalke goalkeeper manual neuer denied several goal scoring opportunities by stuttgart 's pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic .
brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .
goalkeeper jens lehmann had no chance of stopping the schalke onslaught .
but tasci made up for his blunder four minutes later when he headed the 1-1 equalizer .
stuttgart tried to play the offside trap but ivan rakitic 's cross found schalke captain heiko westermann , who gave kuranyi an easy tap in to score the winner .
bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi scores his 14th goal of the season schalke coach felix magath played down his team 's title chances after the game , but their current winning streak at this stage of the season speaks volumes .
his former side wolfsburg went top of the table at a similar stage last season and went on to win the championship .
" my team played as it always does .
more controlled in the first half and more energetic in the second , " magath told reporters .
" but we can thank -lrb- goalkeeper -rrb- manuel neuer that we did n't concede in the first half .
after we took the lead we failed to put more pressure on .
we were lucky to get away with a win . "
schalke have now won their last eight home matches and kuranyi 's 14th league goal of the season makes him the bundesliga 's joint top goalscorer along with bayer leverkusen 's stefan kiessling .
but magath knows that with matches scheduled against hamburg , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich in the coming weeks the stuttgart match will be a hard act to follow. nrt / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and by partying they themselves turn that image into reality - they are ' berlin ' even if they are n't germans . "
berlin has become an international metropolis .
the city is no longer merely the place where the wall came down , or the former capital of hitler 's regime .
it also is the destination for countless people who want to party in one of the hundreds of clubs .
this kind of tourism is different from regular mass tourism .
it 's about the individual 's quest to find something unique and special .
and it seems that berlin is at the forefront of this new trend .

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .
" time is running out , so i 'm sure this is going to be something that we 'll deal with , if the un security council fails , when we have our eu foreign ministers meeting , " the finnish minister said .
he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .
without going into detail , stubb said that member states had suggested a variety of supplemental sanctions which included restrictions in the energy and financial sectors. gb / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 22-year-old rising star , driving for the red bull team , picked up where he left off last season , when he won the closing race in abu dhabi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull 's vettel is looking to be no. 1 it was bad news for seven-time world champion schumacher , who now finds himself starting four rows back from vettel in sunday 's final , with plenty of other heavyweights still in front of him .
after qualifying , schumacher admitted that he had found it hard to reach peak performance , but said he was happy that his team was working well .
" it is a long race and the season is even longer , " he said .
strong german debut starting next to vettel in second is brazilian felipe massa , with his ferrari colleague , spaniard fernando alonso , one row behind , in third .
britain 's lewis hamilton in a mclaren will be starting fourth and schumacher 's german teammate , nico rosberg , is fifth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes is banking on homegrown talent rounding out the top ten are mark webber in the second red bull car in sixth , reigning world champion jenson button for mclaren in eighth , renault 's robert kubica in ninth and german adrian sutil for force india in tenth .
for ferrari , schumacher 's former employer , it was a solid start to the season after last year 's dreadful beginning .
the italians , with massa and alonso , look set to give vettel - and schumacher - a run for their money .
in fact , no one seemed terribly impressed by schumacher 's performance , but then again , everyone also knows that he is one of the toughest competitors the sport ever had .
and , with four germans in the top ten for sunday 's final , chances are that at least one of them will be finishing on the podium. gb / dpa / afp / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .
technical work is ongoing and has not yet been concluded .

schalke are now on 54 points , one point ahead of bayern munich , who can recapture the lead when they host freiburg on saturday .
stuttgart remain in seventh place with 35 points .
" we are happy because we got an important victory .
but we must continue to work hard .
i hope we can play in the same way as today in the next games , " said former germany striker kuranyi .
stuttgart had most of the possession during the first half , but some superb saves from schalke goalkeeper manual neuer denied several goal scoring opportunities by stuttgart 's pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic .
brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .
goalkeeper jens lehmann had no chance of stopping the schalke onslaught .
but tasci made up for his blunder four minutes later when he headed the 1-1 equalizer .
stuttgart tried to play the offside trap but ivan rakitic 's cross found schalke captain heiko westermann , who gave kuranyi an easy tap in to score the winner .
bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi scores his 14th goal of the season schalke coach felix magath played down his team 's title chances after the game , but their current winning streak at this stage of the season speaks volumes .
his former side wolfsburg went top of the table at a similar stage last season and went on to win the championship .
" my team played as it always does .
more controlled in the first half and more energetic in the second , " magath told reporters .
" but we can thank -lrb- goalkeeper -rrb- manuel neuer that we did n't concede in the first half .
after we took the lead we failed to put more pressure on .
we were lucky to get away with a win . "
schalke have now won their last eight home matches and kuranyi 's 14th league goal of the season makes him the bundesliga 's joint top goalscorer along with bayer leverkusen 's stefan kiessling .
but magath knows that with matches scheduled against hamburg , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich in the coming weeks the stuttgart match will be a hard act to follow. nrt / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .
" time is running out , so i 'm sure this is going to be something that we 'll deal with , if the un security council fails , when we have our eu foreign ministers meeting , " the finnish minister said .
he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .
without going into detail , stubb said that member states had suggested a variety of supplemental sanctions which included restrictions in the energy and financial sectors. gb / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schalke are now on 54 points , one point ahead of bayern munich , who can recapture the lead when they host freiburg on saturday .
stuttgart remain in seventh place with 35 points .
" we are happy because we got an important victory .
but we must continue to work hard .
i hope we can play in the same way as today in the next games , " said former germany striker kuranyi .
stuttgart had most of the possession during the first half , but some superb saves from schalke goalkeeper manual neuer denied several goal scoring opportunities by stuttgart 's pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic .
brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .
goalkeeper jens lehmann had no chance of stopping the schalke onslaught .
but tasci made up for his blunder four minutes later when he headed the 1-1 equalizer .
stuttgart tried to play the offside trap but ivan rakitic 's cross found schalke captain heiko westermann , who gave kuranyi an easy tap in to score the winner .
bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi scores his 14th goal of the season schalke coach felix magath played down his team 's title chances after the game , but their current winning streak at this stage of the season speaks volumes .

schalke have now won their last eight home matches and kuranyi 's 14th league goal of the season makes him the bundesliga 's joint top goalscorer along with bayer leverkusen 's stefan kiessling .

seven minutes later , freiburg 's ivica banovic upended thomas mueller - and robben smashed home the ensuing penalty sealing bayern 's victory .
" he is scoring goals and making them , " bayern 's coach louis van gaal said after the game .

every weekend , thousands of tourists come to berlin 's famous nightclubs and experience a city which is unique in europe and around the world . a list of must-see places in berlin has always included the brandenburg gate , the reichstag , museum island , and parts of the former berlin wall .
however , now that over half the tourists coming to berlin are under 40 - around a third even younger than 30 - berlin 's nightclubs are becoming just as popular as the city 's tourist attractions .
in clubs like berghain , watergate , bar 25 , wmf , or weekend , music from the world 's most famous - and expensive - djs provides the soundtrack for the 15,000 tourists that come to party in the german capital every weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the young , techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall in 1989 these nightclub tourists come to berlin to experience a unique nightlife subculture .
they arrive with low budget airlines and , having passed safely through customs , head straight to the famous clubs .
take the berghain for instance .
what was a power plant 20 years ago is now a place where you can party till you drop .
more than two thirds of the guests are from outside germany .
illegal was in according to a british music magazine , ten of the best 100 clubs worldwide are in berlin .
and over the last years berlin has grown increasingly international - especially in its club scene .
" that 's what is driving this city forward and what has changed the city , " said tobias rapp , author and journalist for germany 's spiegel news magazine .
he has been following berlin 's rise to its status as a nightclub capital .
after the fall of the wall , young people discovered the eastern part of the city , which at that time was run down and neglected .
people used old basements and abandoned houses for parties .
there was plenty of space just waiting to be discovered , recalls thomas andrezak - also known as dj tanith .
he moved to berlin in 1987 and was among those who founded the legendary tresor club in the underground vaults of a former department store .
bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of nightclub tourists descend on berlin every weekend " it really was a place of adventure and you never knew what you 'd discover , " he said .
" when we found these underground rooms for the tresor , the place was full of old stuff , there were old russian posters from the 1960s .
it looked as if had been abandoned for decades . "
the key slogan at that time was : illegal .
no one cared about regulations , laws or property rights .
but illegal did n't necessarily mean that something was actually forbidden - it was a term used to describe a certain aesthetic approach .
new ideas emerged from those new found spaces .
art , music , fashion and design were blended together - and the underground avant-garde of the 1990s began .
it was a time for experiments .

every weekend , thousands of tourists come to berlin 's famous nightclubs and experience a city which is unique in europe and around the world . a list of must-see places in berlin has always included the brandenburg gate , the reichstag , museum island , and parts of the former berlin wall .
however , now that over half the tourists coming to berlin are under 40 - around a third even younger than 30 - berlin 's nightclubs are becoming just as popular as the city 's tourist attractions .
in clubs like berghain , watergate , bar 25 , wmf , or weekend , music from the world 's most famous - and expensive - djs provides the soundtrack for the 15,000 tourists that come to party in the german capital every weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the young , techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall in 1989 these nightclub tourists come to berlin to experience a unique nightlife subculture .
they arrive with low budget airlines and , having passed safely through customs , head straight to the famous clubs .
take the berghain for instance .
what was a power plant 20 years ago is now a place where you can party till you drop .
more than two thirds of the guests are from outside germany .
illegal was in according to a british music magazine , ten of the best 100 clubs worldwide are in berlin .
and over the last years berlin has grown increasingly international - especially in its club scene .
" that 's what is driving this city forward and what has changed the city , " said tobias rapp , author and journalist for germany 's spiegel news magazine .
he has been following berlin 's rise to its status as a nightclub capital .
after the fall of the wall , young people discovered the eastern part of the city , which at that time was run down and neglected .
people used old basements and abandoned houses for parties .
there was plenty of space just waiting to be discovered , recalls thomas andrezak - also known as dj tanith .
he moved to berlin in 1987 and was among those who founded the legendary tresor club in the underground vaults of a former department store .
bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of nightclub tourists descend on berlin every weekend " it really was a place of adventure and you never knew what you 'd discover , " he said .
" when we found these underground rooms for the tresor , the place was full of old stuff , there were old russian posters from the 1960s .
it looked as if had been abandoned for decades . "
the key slogan at that time was : illegal .
no one cared about regulations , laws or property rights .
but illegal did n't necessarily mean that something was actually forbidden - it was a term used to describe a certain aesthetic approach .
new ideas emerged from those new found spaces .
art , music , fashion and design were blended together - and the underground avant-garde of the 1990s began .
it was a time for experiments .
" ' illegal ' was the term we used to describe taking over spaces that no else cared about , " said dj tanith .
" techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall - it was the music played in illegal clubs till the early hours of the morning . "
free and wild now a thing of the past but the club scene has changed .
the days of illegal parties in rundown buildings are over .
investors have moved in and clubbing has become big business .
by now , the sector is generating huge profits and the revenues are significant to the city - and so are the jobs provided .

schalke are now on 54 points , one point ahead of bayern munich , who can recapture the lead when they host freiburg on saturday .
stuttgart remain in seventh place with 35 points .
" we are happy because we got an important victory .
but we must continue to work hard .
i hope we can play in the same way as today in the next games , " said former germany striker kuranyi .
stuttgart had most of the possession during the first half , but some superb saves from schalke goalkeeper manual neuer denied several goal scoring opportunities by stuttgart 's pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic .
brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .
goalkeeper jens lehmann had no chance of stopping the schalke onslaught .
but tasci made up for his blunder four minutes later when he headed the 1-1 equalizer .
stuttgart tried to play the offside trap but ivan rakitic 's cross found schalke captain heiko westermann , who gave kuranyi an easy tap in to score the winner .

schalke have now won their last eight home matches and kuranyi 's 14th league goal of the season makes him the bundesliga 's joint top goalscorer along with bayer leverkusen 's stefan kiessling .

schalke are now on 54 points , one point ahead of bayern munich , who can recapture the lead when they host freiburg on saturday .
stuttgart remain in seventh place with 35 points .
" we are happy because we got an important victory .
but we must continue to work hard .
i hope we can play in the same way as today in the next games , " said former germany striker kuranyi .
stuttgart had most of the possession during the first half , but some superb saves from schalke goalkeeper manual neuer denied several goal scoring opportunities by stuttgart 's pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic .
brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .
goalkeeper jens lehmann had no chance of stopping the schalke onslaught .
but tasci made up for his blunder four minutes later when he headed the 1-1 equalizer .
stuttgart tried to play the offside trap but ivan rakitic 's cross found schalke captain heiko westermann , who gave kuranyi an easy tap in to score the winner .
bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi scores his 14th goal of the season schalke coach felix magath played down his team 's title chances after the game , but their current winning streak at this stage of the season speaks volumes .
his former side wolfsburg went top of the table at a similar stage last season and went on to win the championship .
" my team played as it always does .
more controlled in the first half and more energetic in the second , " magath told reporters .
" but we can thank -lrb- goalkeeper -rrb- manuel neuer that we did n't concede in the first half .
after we took the lead we failed to put more pressure on .
we were lucky to get away with a win . "
schalke have now won their last eight home matches and kuranyi 's 14th league goal of the season makes him the bundesliga 's joint top goalscorer along with bayer leverkusen 's stefan kiessling .
but magath knows that with matches scheduled against hamburg , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich in the coming weeks the stuttgart match will be a hard act to follow. nrt / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .
technical work is ongoing and has not yet been concluded .

a business partner of westerwelle 's brother was also part of a delegation to asia earlier this year .

chancellor angela merkel has defended her foreign minister . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle pronounced his whirlwind tour of south america a success on saturday , despite criticism in germany that he combined his official diplomatic trip with personal interests .
shortly before his return to berlin , the foreign minister said his four-country tour , which he wrapped up friday in brazil , was a success for " foreign policy , economic and academic relations and for cultural politics . "
westerwelle , a member of the pro-business free democratic party , was heavily criticized for bringing along his partner , michael mronz , on his latest trip to latin america .
critics accused mronz of allegedly pursuing business opportunities in the sporting events industry .
a business partner of westerwelle 's brother was also part of a delegation to asia earlier this year .
controversy continues green party chairwoman claudia roth accused westerwelle of favoritism .
" he mixed private business interests of his family and his partner with german foreign policy , " roth told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth says westerwelle is mixing private interests with foreign policy the criticism prompted german chancellor angela merkel to speak out in defense of westerwelle and his selection of business delegations , saying she was " confident that the foreign minister 's selections were in full compliance with the rules , " according to a statement from berlin on friday .
westerwelle fights back westerwelle has strongly denied the allegations and said his accusers were attempting to defame him ahead of the vital state election in north rhine-westphalia in may . he added that all delegations he has brought with him since becoming foreign minister late last year " fully deserved to represent germany and its economic interests abroad . "
fdp parliamentary faction leader birgit homburger also came out in defense of her leader , saying that westerwelle was " as good a foreign minister as he is a party leader , " and said opposition parties " should ask themselves if they still support the rules of democratic behavior .

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .

he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .
" time is running out , so i 'm sure this is going to be something that we 'll deal with , if the un security council fails , when we have our eu foreign ministers meeting , " the finnish minister said .
he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .
without going into detail , stubb said that member states had suggested a variety of supplemental sanctions which included restrictions in the energy and financial sectors. gb / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 13.03.2010 berlin 's club scene shifts the focus of tourism to the city großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party crowd creates a ' berlin ' which would n't exist without them young people looking to party love germany 's capital city .
every weekend , thousands of tourists come to berlin 's famous nightclubs and experience a city which is unique in europe and around the world . a list of must-see places in berlin has always included the brandenburg gate , the reichstag , museum island , and parts of the former berlin wall .
however , now that over half the tourists coming to berlin are under 40 - around a third even younger than 30 - berlin 's nightclubs are becoming just as popular as the city 's tourist attractions .
in clubs like berghain , watergate , bar 25 , wmf , or weekend , music from the world 's most famous - and expensive - djs provides the soundtrack for the 15,000 tourists that come to party in the german capital every weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the young , techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall in 1989 these nightclub tourists come to berlin to experience a unique nightlife subculture .
they arrive with low budget airlines and , having passed safely through customs , head straight to the famous clubs .
take the berghain for instance .
what was a power plant 20 years ago is now a place where you can party till you drop .
more than two thirds of the guests are from outside germany .
illegal was in according to a british music magazine , ten of the best 100 clubs worldwide are in berlin .
and over the last years berlin has grown increasingly international - especially in its club scene .
" that 's what is driving this city forward and what has changed the city , " said tobias rapp , author and journalist for germany 's spiegel news magazine .
he has been following berlin 's rise to its status as a nightclub capital .
after the fall of the wall , young people discovered the eastern part of the city , which at that time was run down and neglected .
people used old basements and abandoned houses for parties .
there was plenty of space just waiting to be discovered , recalls thomas andrezak - also known as dj tanith .
he moved to berlin in 1987 and was among those who founded the legendary tresor club in the underground vaults of a former department store .
bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of nightclub tourists descend on berlin every weekend " it really was a place of adventure and you never knew what you 'd discover , " he said .
" when we found these underground rooms for the tresor , the place was full of old stuff , there were old russian posters from the 1960s .
it looked as if had been abandoned for decades . "
the key slogan at that time was : illegal .
no one cared about regulations , laws or property rights .
but illegal did n't necessarily mean that something was actually forbidden - it was a term used to describe a certain aesthetic approach .
new ideas emerged from those new found spaces .
art , music , fashion and design were blended together - and the underground avant-garde of the 1990s began .
it was a time for experiments .
" ' illegal ' was the term we used to describe taking over spaces that no else cared about , " said dj tanith .
" techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall - it was the music played in illegal clubs till the early hours of the morning . "
free and wild now a thing of the past but the club scene has changed .
the days of illegal parties in rundown buildings are over .
investors have moved in and clubbing has become big business .
by now , the sector is generating huge profits and the revenues are significant to the city - and so are the jobs provided .
currently around 10,000 people are employed in the sector , and it is estimated this number will increase threefold in the coming years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is actively trying to promote its image as party capital for years , the clubs had to struggle with the city 's authorities to survive .
but now berlin has realized that its famous nightlife is a major asset for the city and a unique opportunity .
today , it 's actively promoted in the city 's image campaigns .
things might have been toned down since the wild days of illegal parties 20 years ago , but berlin remains one of europe 's places to be when it comes to nightlife and clubbing .
tourism - berlin style " many of those ravers who come to berlin know more about the subculture than the people who live in this city , " says rapp .
" they have a specific image in their head .
and by partying they themselves turn that image into reality - they are ' berlin ' even if they are n't germans . "
berlin has become an international metropolis .
the city is no longer merely the place where the wall came down , or the former capital of hitler 's regime .
it also is the destination for countless people who want to party in one of the hundreds of clubs .
this kind of tourism is different from regular mass tourism .
it 's about the individual 's quest to find something unique and special .
and it seems that berlin is at the forefront of this new trend .

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .
technical work is ongoing and has not yet been concluded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 13.03.2010 vatican says bid to link pope to abuse has failed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican claims there 's a campaign to discredit the pope the vatican has dismissed attempts to link pope benedict xvi to a raft of child sex abuse revelations in germany , denying accusations that he had once tried to cover up the actions of pedophile priests . in a reaction to the widening pedophile scandal in germany , the vatican has rallied around the pontiff , claiming that " certain elements " had launched a targeted campaign to discredit the catholic church .
" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 13.03.2010 vatican says bid to link pope to abuse has failed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican claims there 's a campaign to discredit the pope the vatican has dismissed attempts to link pope benedict xvi to a raft of child sex abuse revelations in germany , denying accusations that he had once tried to cover up the actions of pedophile priests . in a reaction to the widening pedophile scandal in germany , the vatican has rallied around the pontiff , claiming that " certain elements " had launched a targeted campaign to discredit the catholic church .
" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .

" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .
" time is running out , so i 'm sure this is going to be something that we 'll deal with , if the un security council fails , when we have our eu foreign ministers meeting , " the finnish minister said .
he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .
without going into detail , stubb said that member states had suggested a variety of supplemental sanctions which included restrictions in the energy and financial sectors. gb / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .
goalkeeper jens lehmann had no chance of stopping the schalke onslaught .

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .
technical work is ongoing and has not yet been concluded .

chancellor angela merkel has defended her foreign minister . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle pronounced his whirlwind tour of south america a success on saturday , despite criticism in germany that he combined his official diplomatic trip with personal interests .
shortly before his return to berlin , the foreign minister said his four-country tour , which he wrapped up friday in brazil , was a success for " foreign policy , economic and academic relations and for cultural politics . "
westerwelle , a member of the pro-business free democratic party , was heavily criticized for bringing along his partner , michael mronz , on his latest trip to latin america .
critics accused mronz of allegedly pursuing business opportunities in the sporting events industry .
a business partner of westerwelle 's brother was also part of a delegation to asia earlier this year .
controversy continues green party chairwoman claudia roth accused westerwelle of favoritism .
" he mixed private business interests of his family and his partner with german foreign policy , " roth told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth says westerwelle is mixing private interests with foreign policy the criticism prompted german chancellor angela merkel to speak out in defense of westerwelle and his selection of business delegations , saying she was " confident that the foreign minister 's selections were in full compliance with the rules , " according to a statement from berlin on friday .
westerwelle fights back westerwelle has strongly denied the allegations and said his accusers were attempting to defame him ahead of the vital state election in north rhine-westphalia in may . he added that all delegations he has brought with him since becoming foreign minister late last year " fully deserved to represent germany and its economic interests abroad . "
fdp parliamentary faction leader birgit homburger also came out in defense of her leader , saying that westerwelle was " as good a foreign minister as he is a party leader , " and said opposition parties " should ask themselves if they still support the rules of democratic behavior .

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .
" time is running out , so i 'm sure this is going to be something that we 'll deal with , if the un security council fails , when we have our eu foreign ministers meeting , " the finnish minister said .
he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .

schalke are now on 54 points , one point ahead of bayern munich , who can recapture the lead when they host freiburg on saturday .
stuttgart remain in seventh place with 35 points .
" we are happy because we got an important victory .
but we must continue to work hard .
i hope we can play in the same way as today in the next games , " said former germany striker kuranyi .
stuttgart had most of the possession during the first half , but some superb saves from schalke goalkeeper manual neuer denied several goal scoring opportunities by stuttgart 's pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic .
brazilian edu came on for schalke for the second half and opened the scoring less than a minute later , taking advantage of a poor clearance by stuttgart defender serdar tasci .
goalkeeper jens lehmann had no chance of stopping the schalke onslaught .
but tasci made up for his blunder four minutes later when he headed the 1-1 equalizer .
stuttgart tried to play the offside trap but ivan rakitic 's cross found schalke captain heiko westermann , who gave kuranyi an easy tap in to score the winner .
bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi scores his 14th goal of the season schalke coach felix magath played down his team 's title chances after the game , but their current winning streak at this stage of the season speaks volumes .
his former side wolfsburg went top of the table at a similar stage last season and went on to win the championship .
" my team played as it always does .
more controlled in the first half and more energetic in the second , " magath told reporters .
" but we can thank -lrb- goalkeeper -rrb- manuel neuer that we did n't concede in the first half .
after we took the lead we failed to put more pressure on .
we were lucky to get away with a win . "
schalke have now won their last eight home matches and kuranyi 's 14th league goal of the season makes him the bundesliga 's joint top goalscorer along with bayer leverkusen 's stefan kiessling .
but magath knows that with matches scheduled against hamburg , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich in the coming weeks the stuttgart match will be a hard act to follow. nrt / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 22-year-old rising star , driving for the red bull team , picked up where he left off last season , when he won the closing race in abu dhabi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull 's vettel is looking to be no. 1 it was bad news for seven-time world champion schumacher , who now finds himself starting four rows back from vettel in sunday 's final , with plenty of other heavyweights still in front of him .
after qualifying , schumacher admitted that he had found it hard to reach peak performance , but said he was happy that his team was working well .
" it is a long race and the season is even longer , " he said .
strong german debut starting next to vettel in second is brazilian felipe massa , with his ferrari colleague , spaniard fernando alonso , one row behind , in third .
britain 's lewis hamilton in a mclaren will be starting fourth and schumacher 's german teammate , nico rosberg , is fifth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes is banking on homegrown talent rounding out the top ten are mark webber in the second red bull car in sixth , reigning world champion jenson button for mclaren in eighth , renault 's robert kubica in ninth and german adrian sutil for force india in tenth .
for ferrari , schumacher 's former employer , it was a solid start to the season after last year 's dreadful beginning .
the italians , with massa and alonso , look set to give vettel - and schumacher - a run for their money .
in fact , no one seemed terribly impressed by schumacher 's performance , but then again , everyone also knows that he is one of the toughest competitors the sport ever had .
and , with four germans in the top ten for sunday 's final , chances are that at least one of them will be finishing on the podium. gb / dpa / afp / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 13.03.2010 eu agrees on sanctions against iran if un fails großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west suspects iran is developing nuclear weapons there is ' enough consensus ' within the european union to implement unilateral sanctions against iran for its nuclear program , even if the united nations security council fails to agree on a resolution . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said the eu remained committed to seeking a un resolution on sanctions against iran , but lacking that , the 27-nation block would take action on its own .
he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .
" time is running out , so i 'm sure this is going to be something that we 'll deal with , if the un security council fails , when we have our eu foreign ministers meeting , " the finnish minister said .
he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .
without going into detail , stubb said that member states had suggested a variety of supplemental sanctions which included restrictions in the energy and financial sectors. gb / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .
technical work is ongoing and has not yet been concluded .

for berlin , relegation is getting ever more likely . arjen robben on saturday saved bayern munich with two goals to bring the team back to the top of the bundesliga standings , a spot they had lost to schalke a day earlier .
bayern beat freiburg 2-1 , but for some time it looked as if munich was having a hard time getting those three points . cedrick makiadi put freiburg ahead half an hour into the match and bayern fans had to wait until the 76th minute to see robben level the score with a free kick from just outside the penalty area .
seven minutes later , freiburg 's ivica banovic upended thomas mueller - and robben smashed home the ensuing penalty sealing bayern 's victory .
" he is scoring goals and making them , " bayern 's coach louis van gaal said after the game .
" it 's incredible what he is doing this season and i am just glad we have him at bayern . "

he was speaking after an informal meeting with eu foreign policy director catherine ashton and seven other european foreign ministers in finland on saturday .
" if we have succeeded in driving a common line one particular issue , i would pinpoint iran , " he said .
germany , britain and france have previously stated that they agree on the need for a fourth round of sanctions to restrict iran 's nuclear ambitions , but in the past some smaller eu members have expressed reservations .
the details of any such sanctions package would therefore still have to be finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' enough consensus ' for eu sanctions ' time is running out ' stubb said the issues would be discussed at a full foreign ministers meeting on march 22 .
" time is running out , so i 'm sure this is going to be something that we 'll deal with , if the un security council fails , when we have our eu foreign ministers meeting , " the finnish minister said .
he added , however , that he was optimistic that russia and china could be convinced to support a new resolution in the security council .
the european union already has a range of trade bans in place on iran to pressure tehran toward a more transparent uranium enrichment program .
the objective is to maintain these curbs , urge iran to return to talks , and keep more punitive measures in reserve in case the situation calls for them .
without going into detail , stubb said that member states had suggested a variety of supplemental sanctions which included restrictions in the energy and financial sectors. gb / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

every weekend , thousands of tourists come to berlin 's famous nightclubs and experience a city which is unique in europe and around the world . a list of must-see places in berlin has always included the brandenburg gate , the reichstag , museum island , and parts of the former berlin wall .
however , now that over half the tourists coming to berlin are under 40 - around a third even younger than 30 - berlin 's nightclubs are becoming just as popular as the city 's tourist attractions .
in clubs like berghain , watergate , bar 25 , wmf , or weekend , music from the world 's most famous - and expensive - djs provides the soundtrack for the 15,000 tourists that come to party in the german capital every weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the young , techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall in 1989 these nightclub tourists come to berlin to experience a unique nightlife subculture .
they arrive with low budget airlines and , having passed safely through customs , head straight to the famous clubs .
take the berghain for instance .
what was a power plant 20 years ago is now a place where you can party till you drop .
more than two thirds of the guests are from outside germany .
illegal was in according to a british music magazine , ten of the best 100 clubs worldwide are in berlin .
and over the last years berlin has grown increasingly international - especially in its club scene .
" that 's what is driving this city forward and what has changed the city , " said tobias rapp , author and journalist for germany 's spiegel news magazine .
he has been following berlin 's rise to its status as a nightclub capital .
after the fall of the wall , young people discovered the eastern part of the city , which at that time was run down and neglected .
people used old basements and abandoned houses for parties .
there was plenty of space just waiting to be discovered , recalls thomas andrezak - also known as dj tanith .
he moved to berlin in 1987 and was among those who founded the legendary tresor club in the underground vaults of a former department store .
bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of nightclub tourists descend on berlin every weekend " it really was a place of adventure and you never knew what you 'd discover , " he said .
" when we found these underground rooms for the tresor , the place was full of old stuff , there were old russian posters from the 1960s .
it looked as if had been abandoned for decades . "
the key slogan at that time was : illegal .
no one cared about regulations , laws or property rights .
but illegal did n't necessarily mean that something was actually forbidden - it was a term used to describe a certain aesthetic approach .
new ideas emerged from those new found spaces .
art , music , fashion and design were blended together - and the underground avant-garde of the 1990s began .
it was a time for experiments .
" ' illegal ' was the term we used to describe taking over spaces that no else cared about , " said dj tanith .
" techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall - it was the music played in illegal clubs till the early hours of the morning . "
free and wild now a thing of the past but the club scene has changed .
the days of illegal parties in rundown buildings are over .
investors have moved in and clubbing has become big business .
by now , the sector is generating huge profits and the revenues are significant to the city - and so are the jobs provided .
currently around 10,000 people are employed in the sector , and it is estimated this number will increase threefold in the coming years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is actively trying to promote its image as party capital for years , the clubs had to struggle with the city 's authorities to survive .
but now berlin has realized that its famous nightlife is a major asset for the city and a unique opportunity .
today , it 's actively promoted in the city 's image campaigns .
things might have been toned down since the wild days of illegal parties 20 years ago , but berlin remains one of europe 's places to be when it comes to nightlife and clubbing .
tourism - berlin style " many of those ravers who come to berlin know more about the subculture than the people who live in this city , " says rapp .
" they have a specific image in their head .
and by partying they themselves turn that image into reality - they are ' berlin ' even if they are n't germans . "
berlin has become an international metropolis .
the city is no longer merely the place where the wall came down , or the former capital of hitler 's regime .
it also is the destination for countless people who want to party in one of the hundreds of clubs .
this kind of tourism is different from regular mass tourism .
it 's about the individual 's quest to find something unique and special .
and it seems that berlin is at the forefront of this new trend .

" ' illegal ' was the term we used to describe taking over spaces that no else cared about , " said dj tanith .
" techno was the soundtrack to the fall of the wall - it was the music played in illegal clubs till the early hours of the morning . "
free and wild now a thing of the past but the club scene has changed .
the days of illegal parties in rundown buildings are over .
investors have moved in and clubbing has become big business .
by now , the sector is generating huge profits and the revenues are significant to the city - and so are the jobs provided .
currently around 10,000 people are employed in the sector , and it is estimated this number will increase threefold in the coming years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is actively trying to promote its image as party capital for years , the clubs had to struggle with the city 's authorities to survive .
but now berlin has realized that its famous nightlife is a major asset for the city and a unique opportunity .
today , it 's actively promoted in the city 's image campaigns .
things might have been toned down since the wild days of illegal parties 20 years ago , but berlin remains one of europe 's places to be when it comes to nightlife and clubbing .
tourism - berlin style " many of those ravers who come to berlin know more about the subculture than the people who live in this city , " says rapp .
" they have a specific image in their head .
and by partying they themselves turn that image into reality - they are ' berlin ' even if they are n't germans . "
berlin has become an international metropolis .
the city is no longer merely the place where the wall came down , or the former capital of hitler 's regime .
it also is the destination for countless people who want to party in one of the hundreds of clubs .
this kind of tourism is different from regular mass tourism .
it 's about the individual 's quest to find something unique and special .
and it seems that berlin is at the forefront of this new trend .

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concrete plans will be unveiled on monday after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in brussels , british media reported . the eurogroup meeting will also formally approve budget cuts proposed by athens last week as part of a package of austerity measures to reduce its 2010 budget deficit . the 16 eurozone members have agreed in principle to " coordinated bilateral contributions " in the form of loans or loan guarantees to greece if athens is unable to refinance its debts and asks the european union for help , the guardian newspaper reported , quoting an unnamed senior european commission official . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's borrowing needs for 2010 total 53.2 billion euros " the guarantees will facilitate the kind of funds potentially needed in this context , " the official told the guardian . contingency plan one of the options available to rescue greece involves a series of loans by european partner countries , coordinated by the european commission .
the other would involve the commission borrowing money on markets and extending loans to greece that would be guaranteed by eu states . another long-term option on the negotiating table is based on a german initiative to establish an imf-styled european monetary fund to provide financial support for cash-strapped eurozone members . so far , greece has done everything that its been asked to do by the european commission , including harsh austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to overcome its debt crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence flares at anti-austerity protest fiscal austerity the cutbacks , added to a previous 11.2 billion euro austerity plan , seek to reduce greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to 8.7 percent this year . prime minister george papandreou 's socialist government has raised funds by issuing bonds to offset its ballooning deficit .
the initial offering was heavily subscribed .
the rescue plan would kick in if greece found itself unable to find enough buyers for its bonds in the coming months . european commission president jose manuel barroso said earlier this week that brussels was ready to propose a " framework " for coordinated aid . " we are ready to act if necessary .
the technical work is underway but not over yet .
the rest is speculation , " said barroso 's spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde-hansen . in february , eu leaders pledged that they would " take determined and coordinated action , if needed , to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . " germany denies reports the german finance ministry has denied the guardian report .
" we are not aware that such a thing is planned , " a ministry spokesman told news agency reuters on saturday . any financial assistance offered to greece would have to avoid breaching the no-bailout rule enshrined in the eu 's lisbon treaty , and accompanied by new proposals to strengthen eu-level surveillance on national economic policies . the european commission also denied the report , but said that technical work is continuing and the commission stands ready to act if need be . asked whether the 16 eurozone members had reached a deal on financial support for greece , ec spokesman jonathan todd told reporters on saturday , " the commission stands ready to act if necessary .
technical work is ongoing and has not yet been concluded .

" it is clearly evident that in the past few days there have been some in regensburg and munich who , with a certain dogged determination , have sought details to personally implicate the holy father in the abuse issues , " said vatican spokesman federico lombardi .
" to any observer it is clear that these attempts have failed , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to implicate the pope have failed , says lombardi the issue of responsibility the pope 's former diocese in bavaria on friday said he was involved in a decision in 1980 to move a priest who was suspected of sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy .
instead of undergoing therapy , the priest was assigned to a munich parish without restrictions .
six years later , the priest was given a suspended jail sentence for child sex offenses during that period .
the diocese claims this was a decision made by then-vicar general gerhard gruber , but the head of the catholic lay reform movement in germany , christian weisner , has rejected that interpretation , saying that due to the church 's hierarchal structures , it was the pontiff - then archbishop joseph ratzinger - who was ultimately responsible .
on friday , the head of germany 's catholic bishops conference , robert zollitsch , briefed journalists about the situation in germany , where more than 100 reports have emerged of abuse at catholic institutions , including schools and one linked to the prestigious regensburg choir run by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former members of the regensburg choir are among those claiming sexual abuse church activists want changes the recent raft of revelations prompted weisner to express his disappointment that the pope had " not found any words of sympathy -lrb- for the victims -rrb- , nor asked for forgiveness and reconciliation . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview on saturday that the church needed new structures .
he said it was time to consider whether " church-related conditions " had promoted the abuse and that the issue of celibacy for priests should be re-examined .
the head of germany 's child protection league , heinz hilgers , warned however that all the attention should not be focused on cases that occurred decades ago .
he stressed that every year between 80,000 and 120,000 children in germany are sexually abused .
most cases , he said , happen in the family and not through the church or in schools .
in another blow for the catholic church , an opinion survey conducted by the emnid institute for a german television news channel on friday found that 86 percent of those polled had lost faith in the church leaderships ' willingness to pursue the sex abuse allegations. gb / kna / epd / dpa / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for berlin , relegation is getting ever more likely . arjen robben on saturday saved bayern munich with two goals to bring the team back to the top of the bundesliga standings , a spot they had lost to schalke a day earlier .
bayern beat freiburg 2-1 , but for some time it looked as if munich was having a hard time getting those three points . cedrick makiadi put freiburg ahead half an hour into the match and bayern fans had to wait until the 76th minute to see robben level the score with a free kick from just outside the penalty area .
seven minutes later , freiburg 's ivica banovic upended thomas mueller - and robben smashed home the ensuing penalty sealing bayern 's victory .
" he is scoring goals and making them , " bayern 's coach louis van gaal said after the game .
" it 's incredible what he is doing this season and i am just glad we have him at bayern . "
munich is now on top at 56 points , ahead of schalke with 54 , who beat stuttgart on friday .

berlin now is at the bottom of the table , five points adrift of freiburg and eight behind hanover .

strong german debut starting next to vettel in second is brazilian felipe massa , with his ferrari colleague , spaniard fernando alonso , one row behind , in third .
britain 's lewis hamilton in a mclaren will be starting fourth and schumacher 's german teammate , nico rosberg , is fifth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes is banking on homegrown talent rounding out the top ten are mark webber in the second red bull car in sixth , reigning world champion jenson button for mclaren in eighth , renault 's robert kubica in ninth and german adrian sutil for force india in tenth .
for ferrari , schumacher 's former employer , it was a solid start to the season after last year 's dreadful beginning .
the italians , with massa and alonso , look set to give vettel - and schumacher - a run for their money .
in fact , no one seemed terribly impressed by schumacher 's performance , but then again , everyone also knows that he is one of the toughest competitors the sport ever had .
and , with four germans in the top ten for sunday 's final , chances are that at least one of them will be finishing on the podium. gb / dpa / afp / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
