their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline .

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .
" pet looks very seriously upon this case , which once again confirms the terror threat directed against denmark and the cartoonist kurt westergaard in particular , " the head of pet , jakob scharf , said in a statement .
" for some time this network has been the subject of pet 's investigation without , however , this having any relation to the cartoonist kurt westergaard , " pet said .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said that the incident was not only an attack on westergaard " but also an attack on our open society and democracy . "
not the first threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad caricatures enraged the muslim world westergaard has received a number of death threats since cartoons of the prophet muhammad appeared in the conservative danish newspaper jyllands posten in 2005 .
westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .
last year , us authorities arrested two men in chicago who were suspected of planning attacks on westergaard and the offices of the jyllands-posten newspaper .
denmark 's 200,000 muslims make up 3.5 percent of the population and are the country 's second largest religious community after the state-run lutheran church .
an organization of moderate muslims in denmark , the danish muslim union , has condemned the attack on the danish artist and any kind of extremism that leads to such acts. td / nrt / afp / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .
" pet looks very seriously upon this case , which once again confirms the terror threat directed against denmark and the cartoonist kurt westergaard in particular , " the head of pet , jakob scharf , said in a statement .
" for some time this network has been the subject of pet 's investigation without , however , this having any relation to the cartoonist kurt westergaard , " pet said .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said that the incident was not only an attack on westergaard " but also an attack on our open society and democracy . "
not the first threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad caricatures enraged the muslim world westergaard has received a number of death threats since cartoons of the prophet muhammad appeared in the conservative danish newspaper jyllands posten in 2005 .
westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .
last year , us authorities arrested two men in chicago who were suspected of planning attacks on westergaard and the offices of the jyllands-posten newspaper .
denmark 's 200,000 muslims make up 3.5 percent of the population and are the country 's second largest religious community after the state-run lutheran church .
an organization of moderate muslims in denmark , the danish muslim union , has condemned the attack on the danish artist and any kind of extremism that leads to such acts. td / nrt / afp / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline . " in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .

" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .

their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline . " in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .
" pet looks very seriously upon this case , which once again confirms the terror threat directed against denmark and the cartoonist kurt westergaard in particular , " the head of pet , jakob scharf , said in a statement .
" for some time this network has been the subject of pet 's investigation without , however , this having any relation to the cartoonist kurt westergaard , " pet said .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said that the incident was not only an attack on westergaard " but also an attack on our open society and democracy . "
not the first threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad caricatures enraged the muslim world westergaard has received a number of death threats since cartoons of the prophet muhammad appeared in the conservative danish newspaper jyllands posten in 2005 .
westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .
last year , us authorities arrested two men in chicago who were suspected of planning attacks on westergaard and the offices of the jyllands-posten newspaper .
denmark 's 200,000 muslims make up 3.5 percent of the population and are the country 's second largest religious community after the state-run lutheran church .
an organization of moderate muslims in denmark , the danish muslim union , has condemned the attack on the danish artist and any kind of extremism that leads to such acts. td / nrt / afp / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.01.2010 cracks widening in german coalition government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everything is as smooth as it should be in berlin only two months after being sworn in , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government is finding it increasingly difficult to paint over differences on issues ranging from tax cuts to anti-terror measures . the conservative bloc comprising chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had for years longed for a governing partnership with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline . " in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline . " in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .
" pet looks very seriously upon this case , which once again confirms the terror threat directed against denmark and the cartoonist kurt westergaard in particular , " the head of pet , jakob scharf , said in a statement .

westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .

earlier , the two nations vowed to jointly fight extremism in yemen after the failed bombing of a us-bound plane . john brennan , president obama 's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism , said on sunday the us has indications al qaeda is planning an attack against a target in the yemeni capital of sanaa . the united states closed its embassy in sanaa on sunday , saying it had taken the action " in response to ongoing threats by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula to attack american interests in yemen . "
" we know that al qaeda is out there .
we know we have to mind our steps , " brennan told cnn .
a british foreign office spokeswoman also cited security reasons for the embassy 's closure but did not say if any specific threat had been made .
us , britain join forces to fight extremism earlier , officials said that british prime minister gordon brown and us president barack obama want to see a bigger peacekeeping force in somalia to tackle violent radicalism in the region . " downing street and the white house have agreed to intensify joint us-uk work to tackle the emerging terrorist threat from both yemen and somalia in the wake of the failed detroit terror plot , " a statement from the office of the british prime minister , issued on sunday said . on friday , brown called a meeting of world powers to discuss how to combat the growing influence of al qaeda in yemen when government officials gather in london for a january 28 conference on afghanistan .

their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline . " in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.01.2010 cracks widening in german coalition government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everything is as smooth as it should be in berlin only two months after being sworn in , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government is finding it increasingly difficult to paint over differences on issues ranging from tax cuts to anti-terror measures . the conservative bloc comprising chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had for years longed for a governing partnership with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline . " in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.01.2010 cracks widening in german coalition government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everything is as smooth as it should be in berlin only two months after being sworn in , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government is finding it increasingly difficult to paint over differences on issues ranging from tax cuts to anti-terror measures . the conservative bloc comprising chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had for years longed for a governing partnership with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline . " in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 03.01.2010 somali national charged over attack on danish cartoonist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspect has been placed in custody for four weeks a somali man has been charged with trying to kill danish cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose depictions of the prophet muhammad sparked violent protests around the world in 2006 . a court ruled on saturday that the 28-year-old somali national would remain in custody until january 27 .
the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .
" pet looks very seriously upon this case , which once again confirms the terror threat directed against denmark and the cartoonist kurt westergaard in particular , " the head of pet , jakob scharf , said in a statement .
" for some time this network has been the subject of pet 's investigation without , however , this having any relation to the cartoonist kurt westergaard , " pet said .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said that the incident was not only an attack on westergaard " but also an attack on our open society and democracy . "
not the first threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad caricatures enraged the muslim world westergaard has received a number of death threats since cartoons of the prophet muhammad appeared in the conservative danish newspaper jyllands posten in 2005 .
westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .
last year , us authorities arrested two men in chicago who were suspected of planning attacks on westergaard and the offices of the jyllands-posten newspaper .
denmark 's 200,000 muslims make up 3.5 percent of the population and are the country 's second largest religious community after the state-run lutheran church .
an organization of moderate muslims in denmark , the danish muslim union , has condemned the attack on the danish artist and any kind of extremism that leads to such acts. td / nrt / afp / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .

westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 03.01.2010 somali national charged over attack on danish cartoonist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suspect has been placed in custody for four weeks a somali man has been charged with trying to kill danish cartoonist kurt westergaard , whose depictions of the prophet muhammad sparked violent protests around the world in 2006 . a court ruled on saturday that the 28-year-old somali national would remain in custody until january 27 .
the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .
" pet looks very seriously upon this case , which once again confirms the terror threat directed against denmark and the cartoonist kurt westergaard in particular , " the head of pet , jakob scharf , said in a statement .
" for some time this network has been the subject of pet 's investigation without , however , this having any relation to the cartoonist kurt westergaard , " pet said .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said that the incident was not only an attack on westergaard " but also an attack on our open society and democracy . "
not the first threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad caricatures enraged the muslim world westergaard has received a number of death threats since cartoons of the prophet muhammad appeared in the conservative danish newspaper jyllands posten in 2005 .
westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .
last year , us authorities arrested two men in chicago who were suspected of planning attacks on westergaard and the offices of the jyllands-posten newspaper .
denmark 's 200,000 muslims make up 3.5 percent of the population and are the country 's second largest religious community after the state-run lutheran church .
an organization of moderate muslims in denmark , the danish muslim union , has condemned the attack on the danish artist and any kind of extremism that leads to such acts. td / nrt / afp / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .
" pet looks very seriously upon this case , which once again confirms the terror threat directed against denmark and the cartoonist kurt westergaard in particular , " the head of pet , jakob scharf , said in a statement .
" for some time this network has been the subject of pet 's investigation without , however , this having any relation to the cartoonist kurt westergaard , " pet said .
danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said that the incident was not only an attack on westergaard " but also an attack on our open society and democracy . "
not the first threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad caricatures enraged the muslim world westergaard has received a number of death threats since cartoons of the prophet muhammad appeared in the conservative danish newspaper jyllands posten in 2005 .
westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .
last year , us authorities arrested two men in chicago who were suspected of planning attacks on westergaard and the offices of the jyllands-posten newspaper .
denmark 's 200,000 muslims make up 3.5 percent of the population and are the country 's second largest religious community after the state-run lutheran church .
an organization of moderate muslims in denmark , the danish muslim union , has condemned the attack on the danish artist and any kind of extremism that leads to such acts. td / nrt / afp / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .
" pet looks very seriously upon this case , which once again confirms the terror threat directed against denmark and the cartoonist kurt westergaard in particular , " the head of pet , jakob scharf , said in a statement .

not the first threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad caricatures enraged the muslim world westergaard has received a number of death threats since cartoons of the prophet muhammad appeared in the conservative danish newspaper jyllands posten in 2005 .
westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .
last year , us authorities arrested two men in chicago who were suspected of planning attacks on westergaard and the offices of the jyllands-posten newspaper .

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .

he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .

the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .

their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline . " in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .

westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .

their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates .

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .

" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .

westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .

" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .

westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .

earlier , the two nations vowed to jointly fight extremism in yemen after the failed bombing of a us-bound plane . john brennan , president obama 's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism , said on sunday the us has indications al qaeda is planning an attack against a target in the yemeni capital of sanaa . the united states closed its embassy in sanaa on sunday , saying it had taken the action " in response to ongoing threats by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula to attack american interests in yemen . "
" we know that al qaeda is out there .
we know we have to mind our steps , " brennan told cnn .
a british foreign office spokeswoman also cited security reasons for the embassy 's closure but did not say if any specific threat had been made .
us , britain join forces to fight extremism earlier , officials said that british prime minister gordon brown and us president barack obama want to see a bigger peacekeeping force in somalia to tackle violent radicalism in the region . " downing street and the white house have agreed to intensify joint us-uk work to tackle the emerging terrorist threat from both yemen and somalia in the wake of the failed detroit terror plot , " a statement from the office of the british prime minister , issued on sunday said . on friday , brown called a meeting of world powers to discuss how to combat the growing influence of al qaeda in yemen when government officials gather in london for a january 28 conference on afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.01.2010 cracks widening in german coalition government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everything is as smooth as it should be in berlin only two months after being sworn in , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government is finding it increasingly difficult to paint over differences on issues ranging from tax cuts to anti-terror measures . the conservative bloc comprising chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , had for years longed for a governing partnership with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
their wish was granted when voters at the september 27 general elections gave the parties the required mandate for the alliance . however , the difficult negotiations that preceded the signing of the coalition agreement in october did n't seem to augur well for the partnership .
and signs of discord have continued to afflict the coalition into 2010 . " the image of the coalition can be better , " the head of the fdp 's parliamentary group , brigit homburger , told the dpa news agency on new year 's day . meanwhile , the fdp secretary general , christian lindner , made it clear who his party held responsible for flaws in the coalition 's image .
he told the tagesspiegel newspaper on saturday that the cdu / csu lacked orientation where questions of core values were concerned . in turn , the chairman of the employees ' group in the cdu / csu parliamentary contingent , peter weiss , told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the fdp was finding it hard to " say goodbye to party congress rhetoric and engage in the hard realities of government business . " key areas of discord bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu and the fdp do n't see eye to eye on all tax issues at the core of the dispute are the nature and extent of tax relief for citizens .
the cdu is proposing that tax cuts to the tune of 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- be implemented starting 2011 only on condition that they can be financed . the fdp 's homburger has warned that these decisions must be implemented without regard to tax estimates . " we will make clear that we want to keep the promises we made before the election , " she said . tensions also surfaced over issues like opening up european banking information to facilitate us anti-terrorism laws . in november , the german interior ministry , headed by thomas de maziere of the cdu , opted not to block an eu deal giving us authorities access to banking transfer information from the financial-service provider swift , which handles millions of transactions around the world .
the fdp is opposed the swift agreement . controversial appointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the elections was easier than ruling together the fdp also sought to block controversial cdu member erika steinbach from serving on the board of a proposed center for the documentation of the fate of german expellees from poland and czechoslovakia in the aftermath of world war ii . fdp leader and foreign minister guido westerwelle argued that the move would disrupt the process of improving bilateral relations with poland . many in poland view steinbach 's group , the federation of expellees , as attempting to claim victimhood for a group that was on the wrong side of the war , and trying to stake a german claim to lands which are now polish . bruederle calls for discipline federal economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp has also criticized the cdu and csu , saying they should demonstrate more " coalition discipline . " in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the tagesspiegel newspaper , bruederle says there are voices that are questioning what 's already been agreed upon . it would be better for the audience if the " same tune was sung , " he said . rb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de coalition tension grows over us banking terror law the german government faces pressure to stand up to a us anti-terrorism law that would open up the banking information of europeans .
opponents say it infringes data protection and criticize the timing .

the presiding judge said the suspect would spend two of those weeks in isolation .
westergaard was at his home with a five-year-old granddaughter when the intruder tried to break in early saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westergaard was not injured in the incident " i locked myself in our safe room and alerted the police , " westergaard told danish news agency ritzau .
" he tried to smash the entrance door with an axe , but he did n't manage . "
" he used insults , i do n't remember which , but it was bad language .
he spoke poor danish and he wound up saying he 'd be back , " the 74-year-old cartoonist said .
the 28-year-old somali , who was shot and wounded by police outside westergaard 's home , has denied charges of trying to kill the cartoonist and a police officer on the scene in the city of aarhus .
danish police said the man had been shot and wounded by an officer after attempting to enter westergaard 's home , armed with a knife and an ax .
links to islamist groups denmark 's security and intelligence service pet , a department of the national police , said the somali man , who was not named , had links with somalia 's al shabaab militant group as well as al qaeda militants .
it also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to denmark , where he has a residence permit .
" pet looks very seriously upon this case , which once again confirms the terror threat directed against denmark and the cartoonist kurt westergaard in particular , " the head of pet , jakob scharf , said in a statement .

westergaard 's own cartoon , depicting muhammad as a terrorist with a bomb in his turban outraged many in the muslim world , in part because islam considers any artistic renditions of muhammad to be blasphemous .
the publication of the cartoons sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february 2006 .
germany 's die welt newspaper and other european dailies , including france 's soir and italy 's la stampa , reprinted the offending cartoons on february 1 , 2006 , as an act of solidarity to the right of danish newspapers to publish the caricatures .
that month , danish embassies in damascus and beirut were the targets of petrol bomb attacks and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in the middle east , africa and asia .
last year , us authorities arrested two men in chicago who were suspected of planning attacks on westergaard and the offices of the jyllands-posten newspaper .
