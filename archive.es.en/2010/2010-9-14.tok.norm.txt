but many of the nation 's citizens believe public corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the government 's anti-poverty programs . the millennium development campaign reports that poverty in the developing world has dropped by 19 percent during the past 20 years , putting it on track to halve poverty by 2015 . yet there are nations in the world - the un calls them " least developed countries " -lrb- ldcs -rrb- - that have not experienced the rapid reduction in the number of poor seen , for example , in china .
uganda is one of these ldcs .
as a landlocked nation , its development prospects already face major challenges .
but according to some ugandans , there is also a human problem that is preventing significant reductions in poverty : public corruption .
ineffective programs caroline nambooze has not seen much in the way of government help .
she breaks rocks for a living in a stone quarry located outside of uganda 's capital kampala .
it provides construction material for the country 's blossoming construction industry .
two of nambooze 's children died of malaria .
she can barely send her surviving daughter to school with the $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- she earns a month .
" i buy a piece of rock , and i break it into little pieces , " nambooze said .
" that helps me earn money for housing , groceries and the school fees for my only living child . "
the ugandan government , led by president yoweri museveni , has implemented programs like the national agricultural advisory service -lrb- naads -rrb- to help people - especially farmers - in desperate financial situations like nambooze .
the program should facilitate the acquisition of new livestock and better feed by farmers .
but naads faces hurdles that prevent the rural poor from receiving the help they seek .
" i do n't go to naads because i do n't have enough money , " said jane rose kasukari , a farmer and widowed mother of eight children .
" i was told that i had to pay cash to register , and i could profit from the program later . "

it planned to raise the living standards of ugandans by providing them with cheap credit distributed through local cooperatives .
but like naads , its implementation has been problematic .
" the progress report of the un millennium development goals showed a mixed picture of the condition of the programs in uganda , " deo nyanzi , manager of the uganda national ngo forum , told deutsche welle .
" the widespread corruption at high levels is responsible for the failure of president yoweri museveni 's policies . "

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .

but as the deadline approaches , some experts are questioning whether the goals can be accomplished by then . some 200 nations gathered at the un in new york in september 2000 and openly committed themselves to creating a more just world and set eight targets for themselves to reach by 2015 .
international cooperation , members of the general assembly said , would usher in healthier lives , dramatically lower poverty rates and universal access to education around the globe . but with just five years left before the 2015 deadline , the results are mixed .
tremendous progress in reducing poverty has been made , primarily as a result of the rapid economic growth in china and india .

the growth in unemployment coupled with a spike in food prices during 2008 has left 13 million more people hungry than in 1990 . " it does n't mean that we are going to meet each and every goal in each and every country , " herfkens said .

but as the deadline approaches , some experts are questioning whether the goals can be accomplished by then . some 200 nations gathered at the un in new york in september 2000 and openly committed themselves to creating a more just world and set eight targets for themselves to reach by 2015 .
international cooperation , members of the general assembly said , would usher in healthier lives , dramatically lower poverty rates and universal access to education around the globe . but with just five years left before the 2015 deadline , the results are mixed .
tremendous progress in reducing poverty has been made , primarily as a result of the rapid economic growth in china and india .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .

but as the deadline approaches , some experts are questioning whether the goals can be accomplished by then . some 200 nations gathered at the un in new york in september 2000 and openly committed themselves to creating a more just world and set eight targets for themselves to reach by 2015 .
international cooperation , members of the general assembly said , would usher in healthier lives , dramatically lower poverty rates and universal access to education around the globe . but with just five years left before the 2015 deadline , the results are mixed .
tremendous progress in reducing poverty has been made , primarily as a result of the rapid economic growth in china and india .
the poverty rate in the developing world dropped 19 percent between 1990 and 2005 . such progress has left some experts optimistic about how much will be accomplished in the next five years . substantial progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty in china " i am amazed about how much progress there is , " eveline herfkens , founder of the un millennium campaign , told deutsche welle .
" even with the financial crisis , the world is still on track to achieve the first goal .
on goals like do something serious about tuberculosis , like drinking water , there has been tremendous progress , and the world is on track . " yet the economic crisis has created new obstacles .
as unemployment rises globally , the number of working poor has grown , with many former wage and salary employees falling into underemployment and unpaid work in the home .
the growth in unemployment coupled with a spike in food prices during 2008 has left 13 million more people hungry than in 1990 . " it does n't mean that we are going to meet each and every goal in each and every country , " herfkens said .
" but the acceleration that has been created by the momentum of these goals has improved millions and millions of lives . " while real reductions in poverty have occurred in countries like china and india , there are other countries - the so-called " least developed countries " - where virtually no progress has been made . serious setbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis stole political attention from the millennium goals heiner flassbeck , the director of the united nations conference for trade and development -lrb- unctad -rrb- , praised the mdgs as instrumental in building awareness of dire problems .
but he said a flaw in the way the goals were established has hindered countries ' ability to meet them . " the question , ' what exactly are the prerequisites so we can reach this ? ' was not posed , " flassbeck told deutsche welle .
" then the global financial crisis caused a huge setback for the mdgs , partly because this very point was neglected .
in my belief that 's what the un system has to catch up on now . " the goals have also come under criticism because they lack any means of enforcement .
they were created as non-binding agreements , so when a goal is not reached , neither nations as a whole nor people in positions of responsibility face any consequences . despite the setbacks , the goals have helped build awareness globally about poverty in the developing world .
herfkens said she believes the goals also created a sense of urgency in the development community that has helped improve living standards for millions of people . " this agreement is beautiful , and we need it more than ever , " herfkens said .
" with the current crisis , politicians are turning inwards , so we need the millennium goals as a framework to continue to mobilize citizens , educate citizens so they can demand accountability .

dw-world.de opinion : un must realistically evaluate millennium goals as the united nations takes stock of progress 10 years after the millennium development goals were created , one expert says a hard look needs to be taken at what has been and can be accomplished .

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .

but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .

bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .

still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

cambodian textile factories produce fabric for clothing chains the world over .
on tuesday , more than 10,000 workers went on strike to demand higher wages . more than 10,000 female workers in cambodia are protesting against the low wages they receive for the hard work they put in everyday .
needless to say , working hours are extremely harsh .
according to workers ' unions , more than 60,000 female workers have refused to work and manufacturing in nearly 40 factories has come to a standstill .
the cambodian newspaper , phnom penh post has reported that 50,000 workers have been prevented by their employers from taking part in the protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a textile factory in cambodia making clothes for the whole world factories in cambodia manufacture sports goods , shoes and clothes for big international brands including german ones like adidas and puma .
the workers are protesting against an agreement between the cambodian government and the industry , according to which the minimum wages for a factory worker have been fixed at us $ 61 a month .
the unions are demanding a minimum salary of us $ 93 .
hang sarith , a 24 year old seamstress says , that with rising prices , she can not support her family on the money she gets now .
" workers like us want a raise of $ 20 a month .
they raised our salaries by just $ 5 .
but we need atleast 10 dollars more to survive .
everything has become so expensive . " female workers in textile factories have been protesting for a long time . last month , there were severe clashes between factory workers and policemen .
the protests came to an end only after the workers leading the protests were dismissed from their jobs .
chea mony , the head of the trade union says : " the police came and put an end to the protests .
this is against the law .
factory workers have a right to participate in strikes and protests .
they simply came and began hitting us .
you can see that in cambodia law and rules do not have any meaning . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western brands like adidas , puma , c & a and h & m manufacture their products in cambodian factories government needs a reality check 30 year old check phary says , the government obviously does not have any idea of how factory workers are suffering : " the government should try and see the situation under which we work and live .
we are in a really bad state because we hardly earn anything .
we can not live off the money we get . "
more than 30 percent of cambodia 's 14 million-strong population live below the poverty line .
nearly 350,000 men and women are employed in textile factories - one of the key industries driving the economy .
employers believe that the industry could face grave losses in the wake of these strikes .
other than cambodia , workers in many asian countries including china and bangladesh have been protesting against deteriorating working conditions and low wages in factories which manufacture goods for western countries .

the guitar bard is back with a sophomore album that strengthens his reputation for crafting unpretentious poetry in song . a wandering minstrel by nature , philipp poisel 's days as a struggling street musician took a turn when german music legend herbert groenemeyer signed him to his label , groenland records .
after cutting a successful debut in 2008 , the up-and-coming guitar bard now delivers a sophomore album that strengthens his reputation for writing down-to-earth but poetic tunes .
named " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , the album is commanding critical acclaim . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring philipp poisel . deutsche welle : your sound does n't easily fit into any one musical category .
do you see yourself as a kind of pioneer in germany ?
philipp poisel : it 's not at all my aim to carve out a new niche or characterize my music as such .
if someone says otherwise , i 'd disagree .
the music is a product of everything - my voice , lyrics and feelings .
this is simply what has come of it , call it what you may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert groenemeyer has been topping german charts for decades what kind of music are you listening to at the moment ?
i like original things .
i have an old cd i like a lot and listen to often .
funny , it 's by a sardinian men 's choir .
i have no idea what they 're singing , but they do a lot with their voices : very original , raw and deep .
that ’ s just one example .
there 's quite a range and no particular emphasis in any one direction . you 're signed to groenland records , the label founded by herbert groenemeyer .
what 's it like to work with him ? we chat on occasion .
and his whole heart is in it .
but he does n't watch me like a hawk .
he gives me a lot of freedom , partly because he 's also familiar with the standpoint from the artist 's perspective . the title of your second album , " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , and your last name , poisel , have a francophile touch .
do you have french forefathers ? there are some french roots way back in my family history , so that 's where the name comes from , but the title of the album has nothing to do with my name .
it could have been another country really , but i think france is fantastic .
france has such extremes .
it 's so different from north to south .
my parents often took me there on vacation so i have a lot of childhood memories .
for me france is synonymous with simplicity and light-heartedness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poisel has a soft spot for france - especially for toulouse for some , the name of the record might sound like a soundtrack to a catchy road movie , but listening to the music on it is more reminiscent of a reflective road trip ...
absolutely !
often i can best reflect on my life , my past and my future while i 'm driving .
with the car going down the road my thoughts take flight .
and if i 'm at home and my thoughts start to go in circles and get tied up in knots , i need to get out on the road and leave everything behind .
that gives my life a new horizon . last year , you thought you were terminally ill when doctors discovered a tumor .
fortunately the diagnosis turned out to be wrong .
how did that impact your album ?
that experience was n't the linchpin behind the record .
it played a role , for example in writing the track " froh dabei zu sein " -lrb- " happy to be part of it " -rrb- , but that song is the result of a story that goes back even further .
i 'd never been in such an unfortunate situation before and forced to come to terms with life and death .
but even before that i 'd asked questions like , " where do i come from ?
where am i going , and what is life all about anyway ? " the notion of being gone when you die - i do n't find that so terrible .
i think it 's much worse to be separated from the people you care for .
the converse side of that is that i 'm incredibly glad to have been able to meet these people , that they 're a part of my life and that i could have that experience .
i would n't want to have missed it .
so , i 'm happy that my life exists . interview : marc muehlenbrock -lrb- df / gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .

since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?

are cartels intrinsically bad ? half a century ago iran , iraq , kuwait , saudi arabia and venezuela created the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- - an organization that quickly became the modern symbol of the cartel model that many governments around the world have outlawed .
cartels were n't always illegal in germany , however .
in 1905 , the country had 385 officially registered cartels , formed between a total of 12,000 companies .
after world war i , the number of cartels rose even higher – to 3,500 – making germany " a kingdom of cartels . "
it was only after world war ii that numerous policymakers and economists expressed concerns about the threat cartels posed to the very foundations of a free market economy by essentially undermining the competition needed to supply people with goods and services at reasonable prices .
in 1957 , germany introduced its first cartel laws – very much against industry opposition .
" cartels usually serve their founders ' interests , " said daniel zimmer , director of the institute for trade and commercial law at the bonn university and a member of the german monopoly commission , which supervises free competition on behalf of the german government .
" the founders agree on higher prices or on reducing supply and , in the end , consumers have a disadvantage .
that 's why cartels are basically banned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartel expert daniel zimmer says there are exceptions to every ban even with laws in place , companies have continued their price-fixing activities .
according to the federal cartel authority in bonn , detecting such arrangements between companies helps prevent damage worth 500 and 750 million euros annually .
these are conservative calculations , based on the assumption that companies agreeing to fix prices set them about 10 percent higher than the market price .
studies have revealed , however , that cartels can easily add another 25 percent to market prices .
cartel ban - with exceptions in theory , cartels should not exist in the first place because of a self-destructive element inherent in them : companies able to sell their goods at a higher price are inclined to increase supply to make yet more profit .
but greater supply translates into lower prices , despite cartel arrangements .
the most prominent example is opec , which currently consists of 12 oil-producing nations .
critics point out that member states have seldom adhered to negotiated production quotas , and that market prices have rarely matched the cartel 's targets , giving the group a reputation for being a toothless tiger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say opec members rarely meet their own targets are there cartels that serve a good purpose ?
" cartels are banned in principle , but principles can come with exceptions , " zimmer said .
" there are exceptions to all cartels that allow principles to be broken under strict conditions . "
he cited research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- as an example of where fixing arrangements could help save resources because companies would n't necessarily need to " reinvent the wheel " every time they launch a new project .
" european competition protection law foresees exceptions from the cartel ban wherever arrangements serve to promote technical or economic progress or help improve the production of goods or consumer supply . "
a key requirement , however , is that savings achieved through the arrangements must actually benefit consumers .
" you have to rely on forecasts to determine whether this is the case , but forecasts are tied to market conditions , " zimmer said .
in highly competitive markets , he added , benefits gained through a " rationalising cartel " would more likely be passed on to the next market level than in markets with less competition .
is a " good cartel " possible ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could cartels help secure global food supply ?
one could think of " good cartels " in which arrangements between companies help guarantee supply of agricultural products , for instance .
a current example : speculation has fueled wheat and cocoa prices - a development that has nothing to do with real scarcity .
to combat this trend , russian minister of agriculture , alexej gordejew , has lobbied for the foundation of a so-called " crop-opec " .
bonn-based agricultural economist joachim von braun thinks along the same lines , but avoids the term " cartel " because of its negative connotation .
he prefers the term " international crop reserve bank . "
this body would be run by a club of crop-exporting countries interested in promoting a functioning global food supply system .
by adjusting price fluctuations , they would spoil speculators ' appetites to tamper with the market .
cartel expert zimmer believes current laws would not , in principle , ban such arrangements .
" if countries agree to buy and sell crops together , this activity would have to be viewed , initially , under cartel laws .
whether such activity should be banned or viewed as an exception to the rule would then have to be assessed in detail . "

" you have to rely on forecasts to determine whether this is the case , but forecasts are tied to market conditions , " zimmer said .
in highly competitive markets , he added , benefits gained through a " rationalising cartel " would more likely be passed on to the next market level than in markets with less competition .
is a " good cartel " possible ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could cartels help secure global food supply ?
one could think of " good cartels " in which arrangements between companies help guarantee supply of agricultural products , for instance .
a current example : speculation has fueled wheat and cocoa prices - a development that has nothing to do with real scarcity .
to combat this trend , russian minister of agriculture , alexej gordejew , has lobbied for the foundation of a so-called " crop-opec " .
bonn-based agricultural economist joachim von braun thinks along the same lines , but avoids the term " cartel " because of its negative connotation .
he prefers the term " international crop reserve bank . "
this body would be run by a club of crop-exporting countries interested in promoting a functioning global food supply system .
by adjusting price fluctuations , they would spoil speculators ' appetites to tamper with the market .
cartel expert zimmer believes current laws would not , in principle , ban such arrangements .
" if countries agree to buy and sell crops together , this activity would have to be viewed , initially , under cartel laws .
whether such activity should be banned or viewed as an exception to the rule would then have to be assessed in detail . "

a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .

leading government officials have signalled their approval of the reform plans . the executive committee of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- appears prepared to support defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg 's plans to reform the german army , the bundeswehr .
the proposals could see the bundeswehr turned into a volunteer army , after 50 years of conscription .
under the defense minister 's proposals , germany would suspend conscription , but retain it in the constitution .
the army would then only accept some 7,500 volunteers for between 12 to 23 months .
young men would retain the status of conscripts , but they would not be drafted .
guttenberg said that despite the plans , the cdu would remain the " party of the bundeswehr and of security , " adding that the move was not a shift away from the party ’ s traditional , conservative values .
cdu secretary general hermann groehe said the party 's executive committee had not taken a decision yet , but had shown a " great openness " for guttenberg 's plans .
the chancellor 's coalition partner in the government , the free democrats , welcomed the cdu committee 's decision at a meeting late on monday .
a revolutionary reform previously opposed to the minister 's reform plans , the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , has also signalled its agreement .
a difference of opinion remains , however , as csu leader horst seehofer demands that conscription should be completely abolished , not just discontinued . in addition , guttenberg wants to slash troop levels from about 245,000 today to about 164,000 troops in the future .
the result would be what he has termed a " smaller but better army , more effectively equipped for operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could be history in less than a year the armed forces are controlled by parliament the reform is needed to meet savings the government wants to impose on the military over the next four years .
guttenberg made a renewed appeal for his reform plans in the würzburger tagespost newspaper monday edition .
conscription has a grand tradition , he said .
" but it has shriveled and is now only a shadow of its former self . "
twenty years ago , west germans served 18 months in the army or in social services if they were conscientious objectors .
today , the length of military service has dropped to six months and only about 16 percent of those of military age actually serve .
should party members at the cdu and csu annual conventions later this year go along with the proposals , conscription in the german bundeswehr could be discontinued as early as july 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2010 german parliament begins ' divisive ' budget debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day budget debate is expected to be heated the bundestag , germany 's lower house , has begun its debate on the 2011 budget .
the finance ministry is looking to reduce spending drastically but there is opposition as to where those reductions are being made . the bundestag , germany 's lower house , convened this tuesday to begin discussing the budget for 2011 .
according to the finance ministry , spending cuts adding up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- are planned .
germany , like many other countries around europe still dealing with the effects of the financial crisis , is faced with the need to make massive spending cuts to balance its budget .
in june the federal government in berlin proposed an unprecedented package of austerity measures that aim to reduce government spending by 80 billion euros over the next four years .
distribution of austerity the spending cuts have been extensively debated since being proposed .
the criticism , however , is not focused on the amount of the cuts or whether they are necessary , as consensus was reached in june regarding the need to balance the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poss objects to the ' unbalanced ' distribution with that being said , opposition politicians have severely criticized where the planned spending cuts are being made , which will make for continued debate over the next four days among parliamentarians in berlin .
the current head of the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction , joachim poss , said on tuesday ahead of the budget debate the proposed cuts were " socially unbalanced . "
he added : " this is a budget proposal that will further divide our country .
-lsb- the center-right government -rsb- is dividing our country . "
the social democrats argue that social areas are bearing the brunt of the spending cuts , for instance unemployment and child benefits , and that the wealthy are being spared .
from 2010 to 2011 , spending for social benefits will decrease from 54 to 50 percent of the total federal budget . the labor ministry is facing the largest cuts ; it will have 10 percent less funds at its disposal in 2011 compared to this year .
motivation for spending cuts the head of the governing free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- parliamentary faction , birgit homburger , responded to criticism on monday by applauding the government 's desire to rein in the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says spending cuts are hard but necessary she said that the children of germany 's future generations " will not be able to play on mountains of debt , " adding that this was " our motivation for the spending cuts . "
the fdp 's budget expert , otto fricke , echoed homburger 's praise of the government 's austerity package ; however , he added that changes were possible with regard to the distribution of the cuts .
" we will consider any suggestions for improvement of the proposal , insofar as these are concrete alternatives , " fricke said in berlin .
tuesday 's federal budget debate will be followed by discussions of the individual ministerial budgets .
the bundestag is scheduled to pass the overall 2011 budget in late november .

the story is just the latest twist in an ongoing scandal surrounding france 's richest woman . french daily newspaper le monde has accused the office of president nicolas sarkozy of breaching press freedom in a leak investigation .
france 's most famous newspaper stated in a front-page editorial monday it was suing for alleged " violation of the secrecy of sources . "
the paper accused the president 's office of ordering a probe into its reporting of alleged illegal party funding by france 's richest woman , l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt .
le monde claimed the president 's office broke a law designed to protect whistleblowers who leak information to the press .
elysee denies accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bettencourt affair has been dubbed ' sarkogate ' sarkozy 's office firmly rejected le monde 's claims .
" the presidency … never gave any instructions to any service at all , " an elysee spokesperson told news agency afp . france 's national police chief meanwhile confirmed that a ministerial aide had been accused of releasing restricted information .
frederic pechenard said evidence against the suspect was collected through a " legitimate investigation of the origin of leaks " performed under the auspices of the domestic intelligence service 's " mission to protect the security of institutions . "
the leak probe is only the latest episode in a case surrounding bettencourt , who has been linked to alleged illegal funding of sarkozy 's campaign in a scandal that has embroiled sarkozy 's labor minister , eric woerth .
' elysee tried to silence the press ' le monde accused the government of trying to silence reports on the l 'oreal affair and said it had filed suit after being told by police sources that intelligence officers had studied the telephone records of a justice ministry official to find out if he had spoken to reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's pension reforms have sparked nationwide protest " the counter-espionage service was used to find the source of one of our reporters , " the paper 's news director sylvie kauffmann wrote in a front page article titled " the elysee broke the law on protecting press sources . "
sarkozy 's popularity rating is already close to a record low , as france faces a new round of nationwide union strikes on september 23 against the president 's proposed pension reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2010 cdu struggles to maintain identity amid ultra-conservatives ' dissent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what others are calling disunity , merkel called diversity with angela merkel 's christian democratics shedding politicians and voters , speculations have flown that germany may be ready for a more conservative party .
cdu leaders deny their party needs a clearer identity . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- defended itself against rumblings that the party is losing its identity , as the cdu 's unity came under fire from its disgruntled ultra-conservatives .
many conservative traditionalists do not feel at home in the party anymore , according to martin lohmann , spokesman for the cdu 's platform for active catholics .
lohmann told deutsche welle that " conservative core values are no longer being upheld by the leadership , leaving more and more party members politically homeless . "
" there 's a real threat of a breakaway conservative party emerging as our leaders appear to be sleeping through recent developments , " he added .
a new party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcallister said the cdu would remain home to germany 's conservatives such arguments have picked up steam since right-wing figurehead erika steinbach announced last week her resignation .
steinbach was steeped in controversy after statements she made implying poland was partly to blame for world war ii .
steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii .
she told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag that she believed there was room on the german political stage for an ultraconservative party right of the cdu .
polling firm emnid confirmed steinbach 's statement with a study released monday , in which the firm found that a new right-wing party could win nearly 20 percent of german votes .
most of these 20 percent were disenfranchised voters from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , emnid director klaus-peter schoeppner told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
schoeppner added that the two conservative parties had lost a third of their loyal members since the last parliamentary elections in september 2009 .
cdu shedding leaders yet the cdu seems to be having as much difficulty maintaining its own politicians as its voters .
gero neugebauer , a political analyst at berlin 's free university , believes the debate is purely political and has little to do with conservative identity but is rather being " brought up as an alibi by politicians who must realize their position in the party is getting weaker and who feel they need to say goodbye in a loud way . "
merkel 's tight grip on her party has left scores of arch-conservatives by the wayside .
among those who became disillusioned and left party posts were conservative heavyweights friedrich merz and former hesse state premier roland koch - as well as christian wulff , the current german president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultra-conservative steinbach 's resignation cast the spotlight on the cdu 's unhappy right wing although merkel threw her support behind wulff to replace the also-resigned president horst koehler , that move was widely seen as a bid to eliminate him as a potential rival for the chancellorship .
cdu based on ' three pillars ' stanislaw tillich , leader of the cdu in the eastern state of saxony , stressed that the resignation of some cdu politicians did not signify the party had lost its identity .
tillich dismissed the need for a debate over the cdu 's identity altogether , claiming that the formula for a so-called " catch-all " party was " that it has members from all wings -lsb- of the political spectrum -rsb- . "
lower saxony state premier david mcallister meanwhile stressed on monday that the cdu , best known for its fiscal conservatism , had three major streams : " conservatives , those concerned with social issues and liberals . "
he stressed that the cdu was germany 's only big-tent party , saying that conservatives had found their home within the cdu and would continue to do so .
merkel also clung to the cdu 's so-called three pillars .
" none of these roots will ever be neglected because they make up our political strength , " she said .
" there 's no room for a party to the right of the cdu and it 's our task to stop any radical views from gaining ground . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one pollster estimates merkel 's party has lost a third of voters erika steinbach , who despite advocating a new right-wing protest party , says she intends to remain in the cdu , also repeated the party line , with her own twist .
" we have three legs – a table with three legs , " steinbach said , in what has been interpreted as a sideswipe against the party in which she no longer feels at home .

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 14.09.2010 french senate approves burqa ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer than 2,000 women wear the full-face veil in france the french parliament passed a law tuesday prohibiting the wearing of a full-face veil in public .
the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2010 merkel to revive germany 's quest for security council seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's campaign for a permanent seat has floundered german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use her upcoming visit to new york for a united nations development summit to resurrect germany 's flagging campaign for a non-permanent seat on the un security council . merkel and her foreign minister guido westerwelle travel to new york this weekend for meetings to discuss the progress of the united nations ' millennium development goals and the action to be taken in the five years remaining before its 2015 deadline .
as well as addressing development issues during the september 20-22 summit , merkel and westerwelle will also use the new york trip to once again push for germany 's consideration as a rotating permanent member of the united nations security council as part of their wider plan for un reform .
in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany would be wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 14.09.2010 german clubs could lift bundesliga above italy in uefa rankings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's internationals are even more a german-italian dogfight six german teams are bidding for glory as the champions and europa leagues get underway in earnest .
but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

" in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

on tuesday , more than 10,000 workers went on strike to demand higher wages . more than 10,000 female workers in cambodia are protesting against the low wages they receive for the hard work they put in everyday .
needless to say , working hours are extremely harsh .
according to workers ' unions , more than 60,000 female workers have refused to work and manufacturing in nearly 40 factories has come to a standstill .
the cambodian newspaper , phnom penh post has reported that 50,000 workers have been prevented by their employers from taking part in the protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a textile factory in cambodia making clothes for the whole world factories in cambodia manufacture sports goods , shoes and clothes for big international brands including german ones like adidas and puma .
the workers are protesting against an agreement between the cambodian government and the industry , according to which the minimum wages for a factory worker have been fixed at us $ 61 a month .
the unions are demanding a minimum salary of us $ 93 .
hang sarith , a 24 year old seamstress says , that with rising prices , she can not support her family on the money she gets now .
" workers like us want a raise of $ 20 a month .
they raised our salaries by just $ 5 .
but we need atleast 10 dollars more to survive .
everything has become so expensive . " female workers in textile factories have been protesting for a long time . last month , there were severe clashes between factory workers and policemen .
the protests came to an end only after the workers leading the protests were dismissed from their jobs .
chea mony , the head of the trade union says : " the police came and put an end to the protests .
this is against the law .
factory workers have a right to participate in strikes and protests .
they simply came and began hitting us .
you can see that in cambodia law and rules do not have any meaning . "

we are in a really bad state because we hardly earn anything .
we can not live off the money we get . "
more than 30 percent of cambodia 's 14 million-strong population live below the poverty line .
nearly 350,000 men and women are employed in textile factories - one of the key industries driving the economy .
employers believe that the industry could face grave losses in the wake of these strikes .

but many of the nation 's citizens believe public corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the government 's anti-poverty programs . the millennium development campaign reports that poverty in the developing world has dropped by 19 percent during the past 20 years , putting it on track to halve poverty by 2015 . yet there are nations in the world - the un calls them " least developed countries " -lrb- ldcs -rrb- - that have not experienced the rapid reduction in the number of poor seen , for example , in china .
uganda is one of these ldcs .
as a landlocked nation , its development prospects already face major challenges .
but according to some ugandans , there is also a human problem that is preventing significant reductions in poverty : public corruption .
ineffective programs caroline nambooze has not seen much in the way of government help .
she breaks rocks for a living in a stone quarry located outside of uganda 's capital kampala .
it provides construction material for the country 's blossoming construction industry .
two of nambooze 's children died of malaria .
she can barely send her surviving daughter to school with the $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- she earns a month .
" i buy a piece of rock , and i break it into little pieces , " nambooze said .
" that helps me earn money for housing , groceries and the school fees for my only living child . "
the ugandan government , led by president yoweri museveni , has implemented programs like the national agricultural advisory service -lrb- naads -rrb- to help people - especially farmers - in desperate financial situations like nambooze .
the program should facilitate the acquisition of new livestock and better feed by farmers .
but naads faces hurdles that prevent the rural poor from receiving the help they seek .
" i do n't go to naads because i do n't have enough money , " said jane rose kasukari , a farmer and widowed mother of eight children .
" i was told that i had to pay cash to register , and i could profit from the program later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nyanzi blames public corruption for the ineffectiveness of anti-poverty measures the government also set up a program called prosperity for all .
it planned to raise the living standards of ugandans by providing them with cheap credit distributed through local cooperatives .
but like naads , its implementation has been problematic .
" the progress report of the un millennium development goals showed a mixed picture of the condition of the programs in uganda , " deo nyanzi , manager of the uganda national ngo forum , told deutsche welle .
" the widespread corruption at high levels is responsible for the failure of president yoweri museveni 's policies . "
ugandans losing faith in government because these public programs have not delivered , many ugandans are losing faith in their government and hope in the future .
" i do n't think that the government does enough to fight poverty , " jill kyatuhaire kesha , the manager of the westminster institute for democracy , told deutsche welle .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .
ma at least is convinced .
whether the government and the other farmers will come around remains an open question . note : all names in this article have been changed to protect those involved . author : kristin kupfer -lrb- sk -rrb- editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .
ma at least is convinced .

but as the deadline approaches , some experts are questioning whether the goals can be accomplished by then . some 200 nations gathered at the un in new york in september 2000 and openly committed themselves to creating a more just world and set eight targets for themselves to reach by 2015 .
international cooperation , members of the general assembly said , would usher in healthier lives , dramatically lower poverty rates and universal access to education around the globe . but with just five years left before the 2015 deadline , the results are mixed .
tremendous progress in reducing poverty has been made , primarily as a result of the rapid economic growth in china and india .
the poverty rate in the developing world dropped 19 percent between 1990 and 2005 . such progress has left some experts optimistic about how much will be accomplished in the next five years . substantial progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty in china " i am amazed about how much progress there is , " eveline herfkens , founder of the un millennium campaign , told deutsche welle .
" even with the financial crisis , the world is still on track to achieve the first goal .
on goals like do something serious about tuberculosis , like drinking water , there has been tremendous progress , and the world is on track . " yet the economic crisis has created new obstacles .
as unemployment rises globally , the number of working poor has grown , with many former wage and salary employees falling into underemployment and unpaid work in the home .
the growth in unemployment coupled with a spike in food prices during 2008 has left 13 million more people hungry than in 1990 . " it does n't mean that we are going to meet each and every goal in each and every country , " herfkens said .
" but the acceleration that has been created by the momentum of these goals has improved millions and millions of lives . " while real reductions in poverty have occurred in countries like china and india , there are other countries - the so-called " least developed countries " - where virtually no progress has been made . serious setbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis stole political attention from the millennium goals heiner flassbeck , the director of the united nations conference for trade and development -lrb- unctad -rrb- , praised the mdgs as instrumental in building awareness of dire problems .
but he said a flaw in the way the goals were established has hindered countries ' ability to meet them . " the question , ' what exactly are the prerequisites so we can reach this ? ' was not posed , " flassbeck told deutsche welle .
" then the global financial crisis caused a huge setback for the mdgs , partly because this very point was neglected .
in my belief that 's what the un system has to catch up on now . " the goals have also come under criticism because they lack any means of enforcement .
they were created as non-binding agreements , so when a goal is not reached , neither nations as a whole nor people in positions of responsibility face any consequences . despite the setbacks , the goals have helped build awareness globally about poverty in the developing world .
herfkens said she believes the goals also created a sense of urgency in the development community that has helped improve living standards for millions of people . " this agreement is beautiful , and we need it more than ever , " herfkens said .
" with the current crisis , politicians are turning inwards , so we need the millennium goals as a framework to continue to mobilize citizens , educate citizens so they can demand accountability .

cambodian textile factories produce fabric for clothing chains the world over .
on tuesday , more than 10,000 workers went on strike to demand higher wages . more than 10,000 female workers in cambodia are protesting against the low wages they receive for the hard work they put in everyday .
needless to say , working hours are extremely harsh .
according to workers ' unions , more than 60,000 female workers have refused to work and manufacturing in nearly 40 factories has come to a standstill .
the cambodian newspaper , phnom penh post has reported that 50,000 workers have been prevented by their employers from taking part in the protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a textile factory in cambodia making clothes for the whole world factories in cambodia manufacture sports goods , shoes and clothes for big international brands including german ones like adidas and puma .
the workers are protesting against an agreement between the cambodian government and the industry , according to which the minimum wages for a factory worker have been fixed at us $ 61 a month .
the unions are demanding a minimum salary of us $ 93 .
hang sarith , a 24 year old seamstress says , that with rising prices , she can not support her family on the money she gets now .
" workers like us want a raise of $ 20 a month .
they raised our salaries by just $ 5 .
but we need atleast 10 dollars more to survive .
everything has become so expensive . " female workers in textile factories have been protesting for a long time . last month , there were severe clashes between factory workers and policemen .
the protests came to an end only after the workers leading the protests were dismissed from their jobs .
chea mony , the head of the trade union says : " the police came and put an end to the protests .
this is against the law .
factory workers have a right to participate in strikes and protests .
they simply came and began hitting us .
you can see that in cambodia law and rules do not have any meaning . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western brands like adidas , puma , c & a and h & m manufacture their products in cambodian factories government needs a reality check 30 year old check phary says , the government obviously does not have any idea of how factory workers are suffering : " the government should try and see the situation under which we work and live .
we are in a really bad state because we hardly earn anything .
we can not live off the money we get . "
more than 30 percent of cambodia 's 14 million-strong population live below the poverty line .
nearly 350,000 men and women are employed in textile factories - one of the key industries driving the economy .
employers believe that the industry could face grave losses in the wake of these strikes .
other than cambodia , workers in many asian countries including china and bangladesh have been protesting against deteriorating working conditions and low wages in factories which manufacture goods for western countries .

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

after cutting a successful debut in 2008 , the up-and-coming guitar bard now delivers a sophomore album that strengthens his reputation for writing down-to-earth but poetic tunes .
named " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , the album is commanding critical acclaim . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring philipp poisel . deutsche welle : your sound does n't easily fit into any one musical category .
do you see yourself as a kind of pioneer in germany ?
philipp poisel : it 's not at all my aim to carve out a new niche or characterize my music as such .
if someone says otherwise , i 'd disagree .
the music is a product of everything - my voice , lyrics and feelings .
this is simply what has come of it , call it what you may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert groenemeyer has been topping german charts for decades what kind of music are you listening to at the moment ?
i like original things .
i have an old cd i like a lot and listen to often .
funny , it 's by a sardinian men 's choir .
i have no idea what they 're singing , but they do a lot with their voices : very original , raw and deep .
that ’ s just one example .
there 's quite a range and no particular emphasis in any one direction . you 're signed to groenland records , the label founded by herbert groenemeyer .
what 's it like to work with him ? we chat on occasion .
and his whole heart is in it .
but he does n't watch me like a hawk .
he gives me a lot of freedom , partly because he 's also familiar with the standpoint from the artist 's perspective . the title of your second album , " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , and your last name , poisel , have a francophile touch .
do you have french forefathers ? there are some french roots way back in my family history , so that 's where the name comes from , but the title of the album has nothing to do with my name .
it could have been another country really , but i think france is fantastic .
france has such extremes .
it 's so different from north to south .
my parents often took me there on vacation so i have a lot of childhood memories .
for me france is synonymous with simplicity and light-heartedness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poisel has a soft spot for france - especially for toulouse for some , the name of the record might sound like a soundtrack to a catchy road movie , but listening to the music on it is more reminiscent of a reflective road trip ...
absolutely !
often i can best reflect on my life , my past and my future while i 'm driving .
with the car going down the road my thoughts take flight .
and if i 'm at home and my thoughts start to go in circles and get tied up in knots , i need to get out on the road and leave everything behind .
that gives my life a new horizon . last year , you thought you were terminally ill when doctors discovered a tumor .
fortunately the diagnosis turned out to be wrong .
how did that impact your album ?
that experience was n't the linchpin behind the record .
it played a role , for example in writing the track " froh dabei zu sein " -lrb- " happy to be part of it " -rrb- , but that song is the result of a story that goes back even further .
i 'd never been in such an unfortunate situation before and forced to come to terms with life and death .
but even before that i 'd asked questions like , " where do i come from ?
where am i going , and what is life all about anyway ? " the notion of being gone when you die - i do n't find that so terrible .
i think it 's much worse to be separated from the people you care for .
the converse side of that is that i 'm incredibly glad to have been able to meet these people , that they 're a part of my life and that i could have that experience .
i would n't want to have missed it .
so , i 'm happy that my life exists . interview : marc muehlenbrock -lrb- df / gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

the finance ministry is looking to reduce spending drastically but there is opposition as to where those reductions are being made . the bundestag , germany 's lower house , convened this tuesday to begin discussing the budget for 2011 .
according to the finance ministry , spending cuts adding up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- are planned .
germany , like many other countries around europe still dealing with the effects of the financial crisis , is faced with the need to make massive spending cuts to balance its budget .
in june the federal government in berlin proposed an unprecedented package of austerity measures that aim to reduce government spending by 80 billion euros over the next four years .
distribution of austerity the spending cuts have been extensively debated since being proposed .
the criticism , however , is not focused on the amount of the cuts or whether they are necessary , as consensus was reached in june regarding the need to balance the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poss objects to the ' unbalanced ' distribution with that being said , opposition politicians have severely criticized where the planned spending cuts are being made , which will make for continued debate over the next four days among parliamentarians in berlin .
the current head of the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction , joachim poss , said on tuesday ahead of the budget debate the proposed cuts were " socially unbalanced . "
he added : " this is a budget proposal that will further divide our country .
-lsb- the center-right government -rsb- is dividing our country . "
the social democrats argue that social areas are bearing the brunt of the spending cuts , for instance unemployment and child benefits , and that the wealthy are being spared .
from 2010 to 2011 , spending for social benefits will decrease from 54 to 50 percent of the total federal budget . the labor ministry is facing the largest cuts ; it will have 10 percent less funds at its disposal in 2011 compared to this year .
motivation for spending cuts the head of the governing free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- parliamentary faction , birgit homburger , responded to criticism on monday by applauding the government 's desire to rein in the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says spending cuts are hard but necessary she said that the children of germany 's future generations " will not be able to play on mountains of debt , " adding that this was " our motivation for the spending cuts . "
the fdp 's budget expert , otto fricke , echoed homburger 's praise of the government 's austerity package ; however , he added that changes were possible with regard to the distribution of the cuts .
" we will consider any suggestions for improvement of the proposal , insofar as these are concrete alternatives , " fricke said in berlin .
tuesday 's federal budget debate will be followed by discussions of the individual ministerial budgets .
the bundestag is scheduled to pass the overall 2011 budget in late november .

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .

" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

but many of the nation 's citizens believe public corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the government 's anti-poverty programs . the millennium development campaign reports that poverty in the developing world has dropped by 19 percent during the past 20 years , putting it on track to halve poverty by 2015 . yet there are nations in the world - the un calls them " least developed countries " -lrb- ldcs -rrb- - that have not experienced the rapid reduction in the number of poor seen , for example , in china .
uganda is one of these ldcs .
as a landlocked nation , its development prospects already face major challenges .
but according to some ugandans , there is also a human problem that is preventing significant reductions in poverty : public corruption .
ineffective programs caroline nambooze has not seen much in the way of government help .
she breaks rocks for a living in a stone quarry located outside of uganda 's capital kampala .
it provides construction material for the country 's blossoming construction industry .
two of nambooze 's children died of malaria .
she can barely send her surviving daughter to school with the $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- she earns a month .
" i buy a piece of rock , and i break it into little pieces , " nambooze said .
" that helps me earn money for housing , groceries and the school fees for my only living child . "
the ugandan government , led by president yoweri museveni , has implemented programs like the national agricultural advisory service -lrb- naads -rrb- to help people - especially farmers - in desperate financial situations like nambooze .
the program should facilitate the acquisition of new livestock and better feed by farmers .
but naads faces hurdles that prevent the rural poor from receiving the help they seek .
" i do n't go to naads because i do n't have enough money , " said jane rose kasukari , a farmer and widowed mother of eight children .
" i was told that i had to pay cash to register , and i could profit from the program later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nyanzi blames public corruption for the ineffectiveness of anti-poverty measures the government also set up a program called prosperity for all .
it planned to raise the living standards of ugandans by providing them with cheap credit distributed through local cooperatives .
but like naads , its implementation has been problematic .
" the progress report of the un millennium development goals showed a mixed picture of the condition of the programs in uganda , " deo nyanzi , manager of the uganda national ngo forum , told deutsche welle .
" the widespread corruption at high levels is responsible for the failure of president yoweri museveni 's policies . "
ugandans losing faith in government because these public programs have not delivered , many ugandans are losing faith in their government and hope in the future .
" i do n't think that the government does enough to fight poverty , " jill kyatuhaire kesha , the manager of the westminster institute for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the government does not put enough resources in critical areas because it sets the wrong priorities . "
and derrick twinomugisha , an ad agent with the firm ogilvy , said he believes he knows where government 's priorities lie - in its own welfare .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .
ma at least is convinced .
whether the government and the other farmers will come around remains an open question . note : all names in this article have been changed to protect those involved . author : kristin kupfer -lrb- sk -rrb- editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

the finance ministry is looking to reduce spending drastically but there is opposition as to where those reductions are being made . the bundestag , germany 's lower house , convened this tuesday to begin discussing the budget for 2011 .
according to the finance ministry , spending cuts adding up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- are planned .
germany , like many other countries around europe still dealing with the effects of the financial crisis , is faced with the need to make massive spending cuts to balance its budget .
in june the federal government in berlin proposed an unprecedented package of austerity measures that aim to reduce government spending by 80 billion euros over the next four years .
distribution of austerity the spending cuts have been extensively debated since being proposed .
the criticism , however , is not focused on the amount of the cuts or whether they are necessary , as consensus was reached in june regarding the need to balance the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poss objects to the ' unbalanced ' distribution with that being said , opposition politicians have severely criticized where the planned spending cuts are being made , which will make for continued debate over the next four days among parliamentarians in berlin .
the current head of the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction , joachim poss , said on tuesday ahead of the budget debate the proposed cuts were " socially unbalanced . "
he added : " this is a budget proposal that will further divide our country .
-lsb- the center-right government -rsb- is dividing our country . "
the social democrats argue that social areas are bearing the brunt of the spending cuts , for instance unemployment and child benefits , and that the wealthy are being spared .
from 2010 to 2011 , spending for social benefits will decrease from 54 to 50 percent of the total federal budget . the labor ministry is facing the largest cuts ; it will have 10 percent less funds at its disposal in 2011 compared to this year .
motivation for spending cuts the head of the governing free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- parliamentary faction , birgit homburger , responded to criticism on monday by applauding the government 's desire to rein in the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says spending cuts are hard but necessary she said that the children of germany 's future generations " will not be able to play on mountains of debt , " adding that this was " our motivation for the spending cuts . "
the fdp 's budget expert , otto fricke , echoed homburger 's praise of the government 's austerity package ; however , he added that changes were possible with regard to the distribution of the cuts .
" we will consider any suggestions for improvement of the proposal , insofar as these are concrete alternatives , " fricke said in berlin .
tuesday 's federal budget debate will be followed by discussions of the individual ministerial budgets .
the bundestag is scheduled to pass the overall 2011 budget in late november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

are cartels intrinsically bad ? half a century ago iran , iraq , kuwait , saudi arabia and venezuela created the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- - an organization that quickly became the modern symbol of the cartel model that many governments around the world have outlawed .
cartels were n't always illegal in germany , however .
in 1905 , the country had 385 officially registered cartels , formed between a total of 12,000 companies .
after world war i , the number of cartels rose even higher – to 3,500 – making germany " a kingdom of cartels . "
it was only after world war ii that numerous policymakers and economists expressed concerns about the threat cartels posed to the very foundations of a free market economy by essentially undermining the competition needed to supply people with goods and services at reasonable prices .
in 1957 , germany introduced its first cartel laws – very much against industry opposition .
" cartels usually serve their founders ' interests , " said daniel zimmer , director of the institute for trade and commercial law at the bonn university and a member of the german monopoly commission , which supervises free competition on behalf of the german government .
" the founders agree on higher prices or on reducing supply and , in the end , consumers have a disadvantage .
that 's why cartels are basically banned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartel expert daniel zimmer says there are exceptions to every ban even with laws in place , companies have continued their price-fixing activities .
according to the federal cartel authority in bonn , detecting such arrangements between companies helps prevent damage worth 500 and 750 million euros annually .
these are conservative calculations , based on the assumption that companies agreeing to fix prices set them about 10 percent higher than the market price .
studies have revealed , however , that cartels can easily add another 25 percent to market prices .
cartel ban - with exceptions in theory , cartels should not exist in the first place because of a self-destructive element inherent in them : companies able to sell their goods at a higher price are inclined to increase supply to make yet more profit .
but greater supply translates into lower prices , despite cartel arrangements .
the most prominent example is opec , which currently consists of 12 oil-producing nations .
critics point out that member states have seldom adhered to negotiated production quotas , and that market prices have rarely matched the cartel 's targets , giving the group a reputation for being a toothless tiger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say opec members rarely meet their own targets are there cartels that serve a good purpose ?
" cartels are banned in principle , but principles can come with exceptions , " zimmer said .
" there are exceptions to all cartels that allow principles to be broken under strict conditions . "
he cited research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- as an example of where fixing arrangements could help save resources because companies would n't necessarily need to " reinvent the wheel " every time they launch a new project .
" european competition protection law foresees exceptions from the cartel ban wherever arrangements serve to promote technical or economic progress or help improve the production of goods or consumer supply . "
a key requirement , however , is that savings achieved through the arrangements must actually benefit consumers .
" you have to rely on forecasts to determine whether this is the case , but forecasts are tied to market conditions , " zimmer said .
in highly competitive markets , he added , benefits gained through a " rationalising cartel " would more likely be passed on to the next market level than in markets with less competition .
is a " good cartel " possible ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could cartels help secure global food supply ?
one could think of " good cartels " in which arrangements between companies help guarantee supply of agricultural products , for instance .
a current example : speculation has fueled wheat and cocoa prices - a development that has nothing to do with real scarcity .
to combat this trend , russian minister of agriculture , alexej gordejew , has lobbied for the foundation of a so-called " crop-opec " .
bonn-based agricultural economist joachim von braun thinks along the same lines , but avoids the term " cartel " because of its negative connotation .
he prefers the term " international crop reserve bank . "
this body would be run by a club of crop-exporting countries interested in promoting a functioning global food supply system .
by adjusting price fluctuations , they would spoil speculators ' appetites to tamper with the market .
cartel expert zimmer believes current laws would not , in principle , ban such arrangements .
" if countries agree to buy and sell crops together , this activity would have to be viewed , initially , under cartel laws .
whether such activity should be banned or viewed as an exception to the rule would then have to be assessed in detail . "

cambodian textile factories produce fabric for clothing chains the world over .
on tuesday , more than 10,000 workers went on strike to demand higher wages . more than 10,000 female workers in cambodia are protesting against the low wages they receive for the hard work they put in everyday .
needless to say , working hours are extremely harsh .
according to workers ' unions , more than 60,000 female workers have refused to work and manufacturing in nearly 40 factories has come to a standstill .
the cambodian newspaper , phnom penh post has reported that 50,000 workers have been prevented by their employers from taking part in the protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a textile factory in cambodia making clothes for the whole world factories in cambodia manufacture sports goods , shoes and clothes for big international brands including german ones like adidas and puma .
the workers are protesting against an agreement between the cambodian government and the industry , according to which the minimum wages for a factory worker have been fixed at us $ 61 a month .
the unions are demanding a minimum salary of us $ 93 .
hang sarith , a 24 year old seamstress says , that with rising prices , she can not support her family on the money she gets now .
" workers like us want a raise of $ 20 a month .
they raised our salaries by just $ 5 .
but we need atleast 10 dollars more to survive .
everything has become so expensive . " female workers in textile factories have been protesting for a long time . last month , there were severe clashes between factory workers and policemen .
the protests came to an end only after the workers leading the protests were dismissed from their jobs .
chea mony , the head of the trade union says : " the police came and put an end to the protests .
this is against the law .
factory workers have a right to participate in strikes and protests .
they simply came and began hitting us .
you can see that in cambodia law and rules do not have any meaning . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western brands like adidas , puma , c & a and h & m manufacture their products in cambodian factories government needs a reality check 30 year old check phary says , the government obviously does not have any idea of how factory workers are suffering : " the government should try and see the situation under which we work and live .
we are in a really bad state because we hardly earn anything .
we can not live off the money we get . "
more than 30 percent of cambodia 's 14 million-strong population live below the poverty line .
nearly 350,000 men and women are employed in textile factories - one of the key industries driving the economy .
employers believe that the industry could face grave losses in the wake of these strikes .
other than cambodia , workers in many asian countries including china and bangladesh have been protesting against deteriorating working conditions and low wages in factories which manufacture goods for western countries .

" cartels usually serve their founders ' interests , " said daniel zimmer , director of the institute for trade and commercial law at the bonn university and a member of the german monopoly commission , which supervises free competition on behalf of the german government .
" the founders agree on higher prices or on reducing supply and , in the end , consumers have a disadvantage .
that 's why cartels are basically banned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartel expert daniel zimmer says there are exceptions to every ban even with laws in place , companies have continued their price-fixing activities .
according to the federal cartel authority in bonn , detecting such arrangements between companies helps prevent damage worth 500 and 750 million euros annually .
these are conservative calculations , based on the assumption that companies agreeing to fix prices set them about 10 percent higher than the market price .
studies have revealed , however , that cartels can easily add another 25 percent to market prices .
cartel ban - with exceptions in theory , cartels should not exist in the first place because of a self-destructive element inherent in them : companies able to sell their goods at a higher price are inclined to increase supply to make yet more profit .
but greater supply translates into lower prices , despite cartel arrangements .
the most prominent example is opec , which currently consists of 12 oil-producing nations .
critics point out that member states have seldom adhered to negotiated production quotas , and that market prices have rarely matched the cartel 's targets , giving the group a reputation for being a toothless tiger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say opec members rarely meet their own targets are there cartels that serve a good purpose ?
" cartels are banned in principle , but principles can come with exceptions , " zimmer said .
" there are exceptions to all cartels that allow principles to be broken under strict conditions . "
he cited research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- as an example of where fixing arrangements could help save resources because companies would n't necessarily need to " reinvent the wheel " every time they launch a new project .
" european competition protection law foresees exceptions from the cartel ban wherever arrangements serve to promote technical or economic progress or help improve the production of goods or consumer supply . "
a key requirement , however , is that savings achieved through the arrangements must actually benefit consumers .
" you have to rely on forecasts to determine whether this is the case , but forecasts are tied to market conditions , " zimmer said .
in highly competitive markets , he added , benefits gained through a " rationalising cartel " would more likely be passed on to the next market level than in markets with less competition .
is a " good cartel " possible ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could cartels help secure global food supply ?
one could think of " good cartels " in which arrangements between companies help guarantee supply of agricultural products , for instance .
a current example : speculation has fueled wheat and cocoa prices - a development that has nothing to do with real scarcity .
to combat this trend , russian minister of agriculture , alexej gordejew , has lobbied for the foundation of a so-called " crop-opec " .
bonn-based agricultural economist joachim von braun thinks along the same lines , but avoids the term " cartel " because of its negative connotation .
he prefers the term " international crop reserve bank . "
this body would be run by a club of crop-exporting countries interested in promoting a functioning global food supply system .
by adjusting price fluctuations , they would spoil speculators ' appetites to tamper with the market .
cartel expert zimmer believes current laws would not , in principle , ban such arrangements .
" if countries agree to buy and sell crops together , this activity would have to be viewed , initially , under cartel laws .
whether such activity should be banned or viewed as an exception to the rule would then have to be assessed in detail . "

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .

" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .

bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .

it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .

" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .

bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .

as well as addressing development issues during the september 20-22 summit , merkel and westerwelle will also use the new york trip to once again push for germany 's consideration as a rotating permanent member of the united nations security council as part of their wider plan for un reform .
in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany would be wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .
government scientists are expected to announce the results of their tests soon .
but without seed samples , agronomists may never know the full story . author : reese erlich -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 14.09.2010 agronomists suspect gm seeds behind nepal crop failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corn has become a major staple in nepal , so crop failures are a painful blow the cause of nepal 's recent corn crop failure remains a major mystery .
a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .

they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .

" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .
government scientists are expected to announce the results of their tests soon .
but without seed samples , agronomists may never know the full story . author : reese erlich -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the guitar bard is back with a sophomore album that strengthens his reputation for crafting unpretentious poetry in song . a wandering minstrel by nature , philipp poisel 's days as a struggling street musician took a turn when german music legend herbert groenemeyer signed him to his label , groenland records .
after cutting a successful debut in 2008 , the up-and-coming guitar bard now delivers a sophomore album that strengthens his reputation for writing down-to-earth but poetic tunes .
named " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , the album is commanding critical acclaim . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring philipp poisel . deutsche welle : your sound does n't easily fit into any one musical category .
do you see yourself as a kind of pioneer in germany ?
philipp poisel : it 's not at all my aim to carve out a new niche or characterize my music as such .
if someone says otherwise , i 'd disagree .
the music is a product of everything - my voice , lyrics and feelings .
this is simply what has come of it , call it what you may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert groenemeyer has been topping german charts for decades what kind of music are you listening to at the moment ?
i like original things .
i have an old cd i like a lot and listen to often .
funny , it 's by a sardinian men 's choir .
i have no idea what they 're singing , but they do a lot with their voices : very original , raw and deep .
that ’ s just one example .
there 's quite a range and no particular emphasis in any one direction . you 're signed to groenland records , the label founded by herbert groenemeyer .
what 's it like to work with him ? we chat on occasion .
and his whole heart is in it .
but he does n't watch me like a hawk .
he gives me a lot of freedom , partly because he 's also familiar with the standpoint from the artist 's perspective . the title of your second album , " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , and your last name , poisel , have a francophile touch .
do you have french forefathers ? there are some french roots way back in my family history , so that 's where the name comes from , but the title of the album has nothing to do with my name .
it could have been another country really , but i think france is fantastic .
france has such extremes .
it 's so different from north to south .
my parents often took me there on vacation so i have a lot of childhood memories .
for me france is synonymous with simplicity and light-heartedness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poisel has a soft spot for france - especially for toulouse for some , the name of the record might sound like a soundtrack to a catchy road movie , but listening to the music on it is more reminiscent of a reflective road trip ...
absolutely !
often i can best reflect on my life , my past and my future while i 'm driving .
with the car going down the road my thoughts take flight .
and if i 'm at home and my thoughts start to go in circles and get tied up in knots , i need to get out on the road and leave everything behind .
that gives my life a new horizon . last year , you thought you were terminally ill when doctors discovered a tumor .
fortunately the diagnosis turned out to be wrong .
how did that impact your album ?
that experience was n't the linchpin behind the record .
it played a role , for example in writing the track " froh dabei zu sein " -lrb- " happy to be part of it " -rrb- , but that song is the result of a story that goes back even further .
i 'd never been in such an unfortunate situation before and forced to come to terms with life and death .
but even before that i 'd asked questions like , " where do i come from ?
where am i going , and what is life all about anyway ? " the notion of being gone when you die - i do n't find that so terrible .
i think it 's much worse to be separated from the people you care for .
the converse side of that is that i 'm incredibly glad to have been able to meet these people , that they 're a part of my life and that i could have that experience .
i would n't want to have missed it .
so , i 'm happy that my life exists . interview : marc muehlenbrock -lrb- df / gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.09.2010 study shows german youth optimistic despite economic gloom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are looking up , despite the economic crisis shell 's sixteenth study on the outlook of german youth shows a surprising rise in optimism for the future .
but the findings also imply a growing gap between the social classes . fifty-nine percent of german youth said they were optimistic about their own future , compared with 50 percent in 2006 when the last shell youth study was conducted .
thirty-three percent said they were undecided and seven percent said their future was poor .
the first such study took place in 1953 and since then has been regularly updated at three or four year intervals . the researchers based their findings on surveys and in-depth interviews with more than 2,500 germans aged between 12 and 25 .
respondents were broken down by age sub-groups , gender and socioeconomic status .
the current generation of youth faces greater uncertainty surrounding economic success and the value of a university degree , said dr. matthias albert , a professor of political science at bielefeld university who was involved in compiling the study .
yet despite that uncertainty and " the mounting pressure on young people in society , they have not only retained their optimism , but it has increased significantly . "
family orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a university degree is less of an assurance of economic success than previously thought the seemingly paradoxical increase in optimism is based on a mix of traditional , more conservative values and modern , progressive values that are more self-centered .
" they have put a stronger emphasis on closer social ties , " albert said .
" they value family to an extraordinary degree .
and this gives them the foundation , so to speak , and the confidence from which they can try to face the challenges before them . "
but while the overall optimism of youth has risen , the study also found that the difference between the outlook of privileged and underprivileged youths is widening .
a third of youths from socially disadvantaged families say their future looks positive - lower than in 2006 - and 40 percent say they are satisfied with their lives .
middle- and upper-class youth are almost twice as likely to express that same satisfaction .
" despite specific measures being taken , we see no evidence whatsoever that this rift is somehow closing , " albert said .
" and that 's the biggest concern , that despite belonging to a generation which is doing rather well , we are somehow losing a small but significant part of it . "
political engagement youth 's interest in politics has increased slightly - 37 percent from 35 percent in 2006 - but it remains much lower than levels in the 1970s and 80s .
however when filtered for age group , political interest declined among youths aged 18 and older and increased significantly for the younger generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet access among young people has become nearly universal in the past eight years , the percentage of 12 to 14 year-olds who express interest in politics has nearly doubled to 21 percent , while the the figure for 15- to 17-year-olds rose from 20 to 33 percent .
beyond that , younger germans are also more likely to say they would engage in political activities like signature campaigns or demonstrations , which albert said is one of the most significant findings of the study .
" the increased political interest among the young , together with their willingness to become politically active suggest to us that we are witnessing the beginning of a new political generation , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 14.09.2010 german clubs could lift bundesliga above italy in uefa rankings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's internationals are even more a german-italian dogfight six german teams are bidding for glory as the champions and europa leagues get underway in earnest .
but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .

cdu leaders deny their party needs a clearer identity . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- defended itself against rumblings that the party is losing its identity , as the cdu 's unity came under fire from its disgruntled ultra-conservatives .
many conservative traditionalists do not feel at home in the party anymore , according to martin lohmann , spokesman for the cdu 's platform for active catholics .
lohmann told deutsche welle that " conservative core values are no longer being upheld by the leadership , leaving more and more party members politically homeless . "
" there 's a real threat of a breakaway conservative party emerging as our leaders appear to be sleeping through recent developments , " he added .
a new party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcallister said the cdu would remain home to germany 's conservatives such arguments have picked up steam since right-wing figurehead erika steinbach announced last week her resignation .
steinbach was steeped in controversy after statements she made implying poland was partly to blame for world war ii .
steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii .
she told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag that she believed there was room on the german political stage for an ultraconservative party right of the cdu .
polling firm emnid confirmed steinbach 's statement with a study released monday , in which the firm found that a new right-wing party could win nearly 20 percent of german votes .
most of these 20 percent were disenfranchised voters from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , emnid director klaus-peter schoeppner told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
schoeppner added that the two conservative parties had lost a third of their loyal members since the last parliamentary elections in september 2009 .
cdu shedding leaders yet the cdu seems to be having as much difficulty maintaining its own politicians as its voters .
gero neugebauer , a political analyst at berlin 's free university , believes the debate is purely political and has little to do with conservative identity but is rather being " brought up as an alibi by politicians who must realize their position in the party is getting weaker and who feel they need to say goodbye in a loud way . "
merkel 's tight grip on her party has left scores of arch-conservatives by the wayside .
among those who became disillusioned and left party posts were conservative heavyweights friedrich merz and former hesse state premier roland koch - as well as christian wulff , the current german president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultra-conservative steinbach 's resignation cast the spotlight on the cdu 's unhappy right wing although merkel threw her support behind wulff to replace the also-resigned president horst koehler , that move was widely seen as a bid to eliminate him as a potential rival for the chancellorship .
cdu based on ' three pillars ' stanislaw tillich , leader of the cdu in the eastern state of saxony , stressed that the resignation of some cdu politicians did not signify the party had lost its identity .
tillich dismissed the need for a debate over the cdu 's identity altogether , claiming that the formula for a so-called " catch-all " party was " that it has members from all wings -lsb- of the political spectrum -rsb- . "
lower saxony state premier david mcallister meanwhile stressed on monday that the cdu , best known for its fiscal conservatism , had three major streams : " conservatives , those concerned with social issues and liberals . "
he stressed that the cdu was germany 's only big-tent party , saying that conservatives had found their home within the cdu and would continue to do so .
merkel also clung to the cdu 's so-called three pillars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 14.09.2010 conscription in germany set to be consigned to history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr will be " smaller but more efficient " after more than 50 years of conscription , germany 's bundeswehr is on the brink of turning into an all-volunteer army .
leading government officials have signalled their approval of the reform plans . the executive committee of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- appears prepared to support defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg 's plans to reform the german army , the bundeswehr .
the proposals could see the bundeswehr turned into a volunteer army , after 50 years of conscription .
under the defense minister 's proposals , germany would suspend conscription , but retain it in the constitution .
the army would then only accept some 7,500 volunteers for between 12 to 23 months .
young men would retain the status of conscripts , but they would not be drafted .
guttenberg said that despite the plans , the cdu would remain the " party of the bundeswehr and of security , " adding that the move was not a shift away from the party ’ s traditional , conservative values .
cdu secretary general hermann groehe said the party 's executive committee had not taken a decision yet , but had shown a " great openness " for guttenberg 's plans .
the chancellor 's coalition partner in the government , the free democrats , welcomed the cdu committee 's decision at a meeting late on monday .
a revolutionary reform previously opposed to the minister 's reform plans , the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , has also signalled its agreement .

leading government officials have signalled their approval of the reform plans . the executive committee of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- appears prepared to support defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg 's plans to reform the german army , the bundeswehr .
the proposals could see the bundeswehr turned into a volunteer army , after 50 years of conscription .
under the defense minister 's proposals , germany would suspend conscription , but retain it in the constitution .
the army would then only accept some 7,500 volunteers for between 12 to 23 months .
young men would retain the status of conscripts , but they would not be drafted .
guttenberg said that despite the plans , the cdu would remain the " party of the bundeswehr and of security , " adding that the move was not a shift away from the party ’ s traditional , conservative values .
cdu secretary general hermann groehe said the party 's executive committee had not taken a decision yet , but had shown a " great openness " for guttenberg 's plans .
the chancellor 's coalition partner in the government , the free democrats , welcomed the cdu committee 's decision at a meeting late on monday .
a revolutionary reform previously opposed to the minister 's reform plans , the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , has also signalled its agreement .
a difference of opinion remains , however , as csu leader horst seehofer demands that conscription should be completely abolished , not just discontinued . in addition , guttenberg wants to slash troop levels from about 245,000 today to about 164,000 troops in the future .

the finance ministry is looking to reduce spending drastically but there is opposition as to where those reductions are being made . the bundestag , germany 's lower house , convened this tuesday to begin discussing the budget for 2011 .
according to the finance ministry , spending cuts adding up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- are planned .
germany , like many other countries around europe still dealing with the effects of the financial crisis , is faced with the need to make massive spending cuts to balance its budget .
in june the federal government in berlin proposed an unprecedented package of austerity measures that aim to reduce government spending by 80 billion euros over the next four years .
distribution of austerity the spending cuts have been extensively debated since being proposed .
the criticism , however , is not focused on the amount of the cuts or whether they are necessary , as consensus was reached in june regarding the need to balance the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poss objects to the ' unbalanced ' distribution with that being said , opposition politicians have severely criticized where the planned spending cuts are being made , which will make for continued debate over the next four days among parliamentarians in berlin .
the current head of the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction , joachim poss , said on tuesday ahead of the budget debate the proposed cuts were " socially unbalanced . "
he added : " this is a budget proposal that will further divide our country .
-lsb- the center-right government -rsb- is dividing our country . "
the social democrats argue that social areas are bearing the brunt of the spending cuts , for instance unemployment and child benefits , and that the wealthy are being spared .
from 2010 to 2011 , spending for social benefits will decrease from 54 to 50 percent of the total federal budget . the labor ministry is facing the largest cuts ; it will have 10 percent less funds at its disposal in 2011 compared to this year .
motivation for spending cuts the head of the governing free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- parliamentary faction , birgit homburger , responded to criticism on monday by applauding the government 's desire to rein in the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says spending cuts are hard but necessary she said that the children of germany 's future generations " will not be able to play on mountains of debt , " adding that this was " our motivation for the spending cuts . "
the fdp 's budget expert , otto fricke , echoed homburger 's praise of the government 's austerity package ; however , he added that changes were possible with regard to the distribution of the cuts .
" we will consider any suggestions for improvement of the proposal , insofar as these are concrete alternatives , " fricke said in berlin .
tuesday 's federal budget debate will be followed by discussions of the individual ministerial budgets .
the bundestag is scheduled to pass the overall 2011 budget in late november .

a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .
government scientists are expected to announce the results of their tests soon .
but without seed samples , agronomists may never know the full story . author : reese erlich -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .
government scientists are expected to announce the results of their tests soon .
but without seed samples , agronomists may never know the full story . author : reese erlich -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the story is just the latest twist in an ongoing scandal surrounding france 's richest woman . french daily newspaper le monde has accused the office of president nicolas sarkozy of breaching press freedom in a leak investigation .
france 's most famous newspaper stated in a front-page editorial monday it was suing for alleged " violation of the secrecy of sources . "
the paper accused the president 's office of ordering a probe into its reporting of alleged illegal party funding by france 's richest woman , l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt .
le monde claimed the president 's office broke a law designed to protect whistleblowers who leak information to the press .
elysee denies accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bettencourt affair has been dubbed ' sarkogate ' sarkozy 's office firmly rejected le monde 's claims .
" the presidency … never gave any instructions to any service at all , " an elysee spokesperson told news agency afp . france 's national police chief meanwhile confirmed that a ministerial aide had been accused of releasing restricted information .
frederic pechenard said evidence against the suspect was collected through a " legitimate investigation of the origin of leaks " performed under the auspices of the domestic intelligence service 's " mission to protect the security of institutions . "
the leak probe is only the latest episode in a case surrounding bettencourt , who has been linked to alleged illegal funding of sarkozy 's campaign in a scandal that has embroiled sarkozy 's labor minister , eric woerth .
' elysee tried to silence the press ' le monde accused the government of trying to silence reports on the l 'oreal affair and said it had filed suit after being told by police sources that intelligence officers had studied the telephone records of a justice ministry official to find out if he had spoken to reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's pension reforms have sparked nationwide protest " the counter-espionage service was used to find the source of one of our reporters , " the paper 's news director sylvie kauffmann wrote in a front page article titled " the elysee broke the law on protecting press sources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

international cooperation , members of the general assembly said , would usher in healthier lives , dramatically lower poverty rates and universal access to education around the globe . but with just five years left before the 2015 deadline , the results are mixed .
tremendous progress in reducing poverty has been made , primarily as a result of the rapid economic growth in china and india .
the poverty rate in the developing world dropped 19 percent between 1990 and 2005 . such progress has left some experts optimistic about how much will be accomplished in the next five years . substantial progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty in china " i am amazed about how much progress there is , " eveline herfkens , founder of the un millennium campaign , told deutsche welle .

the growth in unemployment coupled with a spike in food prices during 2008 has left 13 million more people hungry than in 1990 . " it does n't mean that we are going to meet each and every goal in each and every country , " herfkens said .

but he said a flaw in the way the goals were established has hindered countries ' ability to meet them . " the question , ' what exactly are the prerequisites so we can reach this ? ' was not posed , " flassbeck told deutsche welle .
" then the global financial crisis caused a huge setback for the mdgs , partly because this very point was neglected .
in my belief that 's what the un system has to catch up on now . " the goals have also come under criticism because they lack any means of enforcement .
they were created as non-binding agreements , so when a goal is not reached , neither nations as a whole nor people in positions of responsibility face any consequences . despite the setbacks , the goals have helped build awareness globally about poverty in the developing world .
herfkens said she believes the goals also created a sense of urgency in the development community that has helped improve living standards for millions of people . " this agreement is beautiful , and we need it more than ever , " herfkens said .

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

cdu leaders deny their party needs a clearer identity . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- defended itself against rumblings that the party is losing its identity , as the cdu 's unity came under fire from its disgruntled ultra-conservatives .
many conservative traditionalists do not feel at home in the party anymore , according to martin lohmann , spokesman for the cdu 's platform for active catholics .
lohmann told deutsche welle that " conservative core values are no longer being upheld by the leadership , leaving more and more party members politically homeless . "
" there 's a real threat of a breakaway conservative party emerging as our leaders appear to be sleeping through recent developments , " he added .
a new party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcallister said the cdu would remain home to germany 's conservatives such arguments have picked up steam since right-wing figurehead erika steinbach announced last week her resignation .
steinbach was steeped in controversy after statements she made implying poland was partly to blame for world war ii .
steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii .
she told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag that she believed there was room on the german political stage for an ultraconservative party right of the cdu .
polling firm emnid confirmed steinbach 's statement with a study released monday , in which the firm found that a new right-wing party could win nearly 20 percent of german votes .
most of these 20 percent were disenfranchised voters from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , emnid director klaus-peter schoeppner told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
schoeppner added that the two conservative parties had lost a third of their loyal members since the last parliamentary elections in september 2009 .
cdu shedding leaders yet the cdu seems to be having as much difficulty maintaining its own politicians as its voters .
gero neugebauer , a political analyst at berlin 's free university , believes the debate is purely political and has little to do with conservative identity but is rather being " brought up as an alibi by politicians who must realize their position in the party is getting weaker and who feel they need to say goodbye in a loud way . "
merkel 's tight grip on her party has left scores of arch-conservatives by the wayside .
among those who became disillusioned and left party posts were conservative heavyweights friedrich merz and former hesse state premier roland koch - as well as christian wulff , the current german president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultra-conservative steinbach 's resignation cast the spotlight on the cdu 's unhappy right wing although merkel threw her support behind wulff to replace the also-resigned president horst koehler , that move was widely seen as a bid to eliminate him as a potential rival for the chancellorship .
cdu based on ' three pillars ' stanislaw tillich , leader of the cdu in the eastern state of saxony , stressed that the resignation of some cdu politicians did not signify the party had lost its identity .
tillich dismissed the need for a debate over the cdu 's identity altogether , claiming that the formula for a so-called " catch-all " party was " that it has members from all wings -lsb- of the political spectrum -rsb- . "
lower saxony state premier david mcallister meanwhile stressed on monday that the cdu , best known for its fiscal conservatism , had three major streams : " conservatives , those concerned with social issues and liberals . "
he stressed that the cdu was germany 's only big-tent party , saying that conservatives had found their home within the cdu and would continue to do so .
merkel also clung to the cdu 's so-called three pillars .
" none of these roots will ever be neglected because they make up our political strength , " she said .
" there 's no room for a party to the right of the cdu and it 's our task to stop any radical views from gaining ground . "

cdu leaders deny their party needs a clearer identity . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- defended itself against rumblings that the party is losing its identity , as the cdu 's unity came under fire from its disgruntled ultra-conservatives .
many conservative traditionalists do not feel at home in the party anymore , according to martin lohmann , spokesman for the cdu 's platform for active catholics .
lohmann told deutsche welle that " conservative core values are no longer being upheld by the leadership , leaving more and more party members politically homeless . "
" there 's a real threat of a breakaway conservative party emerging as our leaders appear to be sleeping through recent developments , " he added .
a new party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcallister said the cdu would remain home to germany 's conservatives such arguments have picked up steam since right-wing figurehead erika steinbach announced last week her resignation .
steinbach was steeped in controversy after statements she made implying poland was partly to blame for world war ii .
steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii .
she told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag that she believed there was room on the german political stage for an ultraconservative party right of the cdu .
polling firm emnid confirmed steinbach 's statement with a study released monday , in which the firm found that a new right-wing party could win nearly 20 percent of german votes .
most of these 20 percent were disenfranchised voters from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , emnid director klaus-peter schoeppner told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
schoeppner added that the two conservative parties had lost a third of their loyal members since the last parliamentary elections in september 2009 .
cdu shedding leaders yet the cdu seems to be having as much difficulty maintaining its own politicians as its voters .
gero neugebauer , a political analyst at berlin 's free university , believes the debate is purely political and has little to do with conservative identity but is rather being " brought up as an alibi by politicians who must realize their position in the party is getting weaker and who feel they need to say goodbye in a loud way . "
merkel 's tight grip on her party has left scores of arch-conservatives by the wayside .
among those who became disillusioned and left party posts were conservative heavyweights friedrich merz and former hesse state premier roland koch - as well as christian wulff , the current german president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultra-conservative steinbach 's resignation cast the spotlight on the cdu 's unhappy right wing although merkel threw her support behind wulff to replace the also-resigned president horst koehler , that move was widely seen as a bid to eliminate him as a potential rival for the chancellorship .
cdu based on ' three pillars ' stanislaw tillich , leader of the cdu in the eastern state of saxony , stressed that the resignation of some cdu politicians did not signify the party had lost its identity .
tillich dismissed the need for a debate over the cdu 's identity altogether , claiming that the formula for a so-called " catch-all " party was " that it has members from all wings -lsb- of the political spectrum -rsb- . "
lower saxony state premier david mcallister meanwhile stressed on monday that the cdu , best known for its fiscal conservatism , had three major streams : " conservatives , those concerned with social issues and liberals . "
he stressed that the cdu was germany 's only big-tent party , saying that conservatives had found their home within the cdu and would continue to do so .
merkel also clung to the cdu 's so-called three pillars .
" none of these roots will ever be neglected because they make up our political strength , " she said .
" there 's no room for a party to the right of the cdu and it 's our task to stop any radical views from gaining ground . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one pollster estimates merkel 's party has lost a third of voters erika steinbach , who despite advocating a new right-wing protest party , says she intends to remain in the cdu , also repeated the party line , with her own twist .
" we have three legs – a table with three legs , " steinbach said , in what has been interpreted as a sideswipe against the party in which she no longer feels at home .

the finance ministry is looking to reduce spending drastically but there is opposition as to where those reductions are being made . the bundestag , germany 's lower house , convened this tuesday to begin discussing the budget for 2011 .
according to the finance ministry , spending cuts adding up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- are planned .
germany , like many other countries around europe still dealing with the effects of the financial crisis , is faced with the need to make massive spending cuts to balance its budget .
in june the federal government in berlin proposed an unprecedented package of austerity measures that aim to reduce government spending by 80 billion euros over the next four years .
distribution of austerity the spending cuts have been extensively debated since being proposed .

he added : " this is a budget proposal that will further divide our country .
-lsb- the center-right government -rsb- is dividing our country . "
the social democrats argue that social areas are bearing the brunt of the spending cuts , for instance unemployment and child benefits , and that the wealthy are being spared .
from 2010 to 2011 , spending for social benefits will decrease from 54 to 50 percent of the total federal budget . the labor ministry is facing the largest cuts ; it will have 10 percent less funds at its disposal in 2011 compared to this year .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says spending cuts are hard but necessary she said that the children of germany 's future generations " will not be able to play on mountains of debt , " adding that this was " our motivation for the spending cuts . "

" we will consider any suggestions for improvement of the proposal , insofar as these are concrete alternatives , " fricke said in berlin .
tuesday 's federal budget debate will be followed by discussions of the individual ministerial budgets .
the bundestag is scheduled to pass the overall 2011 budget in late november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 14.09.2010 conscription in germany set to be consigned to history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr will be " smaller but more efficient " after more than 50 years of conscription , germany 's bundeswehr is on the brink of turning into an all-volunteer army .
leading government officials have signalled their approval of the reform plans . the executive committee of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- appears prepared to support defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg 's plans to reform the german army , the bundeswehr .
the proposals could see the bundeswehr turned into a volunteer army , after 50 years of conscription .
under the defense minister 's proposals , germany would suspend conscription , but retain it in the constitution .
the army would then only accept some 7,500 volunteers for between 12 to 23 months .
young men would retain the status of conscripts , but they would not be drafted .
guttenberg said that despite the plans , the cdu would remain the " party of the bundeswehr and of security , " adding that the move was not a shift away from the party ’ s traditional , conservative values .
cdu secretary general hermann groehe said the party 's executive committee had not taken a decision yet , but had shown a " great openness " for guttenberg 's plans .
the chancellor 's coalition partner in the government , the free democrats , welcomed the cdu committee 's decision at a meeting late on monday .
a revolutionary reform previously opposed to the minister 's reform plans , the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , has also signalled its agreement .
a difference of opinion remains , however , as csu leader horst seehofer demands that conscription should be completely abolished , not just discontinued . in addition , guttenberg wants to slash troop levels from about 245,000 today to about 164,000 troops in the future .
the result would be what he has termed a " smaller but better army , more effectively equipped for operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could be history in less than a year the armed forces are controlled by parliament the reform is needed to meet savings the government wants to impose on the military over the next four years .
guttenberg made a renewed appeal for his reform plans in the würzburger tagespost newspaper monday edition .
conscription has a grand tradition , he said .
" but it has shriveled and is now only a shadow of its former self . "
twenty years ago , west germans served 18 months in the army or in social services if they were conscientious objectors .
today , the length of military service has dropped to six months and only about 16 percent of those of military age actually serve .
should party members at the cdu and csu annual conventions later this year go along with the proposals , conscription in the german bundeswehr could be discontinued as early as july 2011 .

leading government officials have signalled their approval of the reform plans . the executive committee of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- appears prepared to support defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg 's plans to reform the german army , the bundeswehr .
the proposals could see the bundeswehr turned into a volunteer army , after 50 years of conscription .
under the defense minister 's proposals , germany would suspend conscription , but retain it in the constitution .
the army would then only accept some 7,500 volunteers for between 12 to 23 months .
young men would retain the status of conscripts , but they would not be drafted .
guttenberg said that despite the plans , the cdu would remain the " party of the bundeswehr and of security , " adding that the move was not a shift away from the party ’ s traditional , conservative values .
cdu secretary general hermann groehe said the party 's executive committee had not taken a decision yet , but had shown a " great openness " for guttenberg 's plans .
the chancellor 's coalition partner in the government , the free democrats , welcomed the cdu committee 's decision at a meeting late on monday .
a revolutionary reform previously opposed to the minister 's reform plans , the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , has also signalled its agreement .
a difference of opinion remains , however , as csu leader horst seehofer demands that conscription should be completely abolished , not just discontinued . in addition , guttenberg wants to slash troop levels from about 245,000 today to about 164,000 troops in the future .
the result would be what he has termed a " smaller but better army , more effectively equipped for operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could be history in less than a year the armed forces are controlled by parliament the reform is needed to meet savings the government wants to impose on the military over the next four years .
guttenberg made a renewed appeal for his reform plans in the würzburger tagespost newspaper monday edition .
conscription has a grand tradition , he said .
" but it has shriveled and is now only a shadow of its former self . "
twenty years ago , west germans served 18 months in the army or in social services if they were conscientious objectors .
today , the length of military service has dropped to six months and only about 16 percent of those of military age actually serve .
should party members at the cdu and csu annual conventions later this year go along with the proposals , conscription in the german bundeswehr could be discontinued as early as july 2011 .

incumbent alexander lukashenko , whom washington dubs " europe 's last dictator " is widely expected to seek a fourth term . the belarusian parliament has set presidential polls for december 19 in which long-time president alexander lukashenko is expected to run for a fourth term .
the date was approved by 108 of 110 members of the parliament , which is dominated by supporters of lukashenko , who has ruled the former soviet republic with an iron fist since 1994 .
after being famously described by washington as europe 's last dictator , lukashenko has made attempts at greater openness .
this has resulted in a sharp deterioration in relations with russia , which could complicate lukashenko 's efforts to secure a landslide victory , as he did in each of belarus ' previous three presidential elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 14.09.2010 agronomists suspect gm seeds behind nepal crop failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corn has become a major staple in nepal , so crop failures are a painful blow the cause of nepal 's recent corn crop failure remains a major mystery .
a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .
government scientists are expected to announce the results of their tests soon .
but without seed samples , agronomists may never know the full story . author : reese erlich -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "

they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .

a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "

since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

as well as addressing development issues during the september 20-22 summit , merkel and westerwelle will also use the new york trip to once again push for germany 's consideration as a rotating permanent member of the united nations security council as part of their wider plan for un reform .
in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany would be wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

" the european commission has strongly criticized the french government for its decision to deport hundreds of roma migrants in recent weeks .
justice commissioner viviane reding said she was appalled by the expulsions and described the policy as a " disgrace . "
" it is shocking that a part of the -lrb- french -rrb- government comes here and says something and another part of the government does the opposite , " she said .
" my patience is wearing thin : enough is enough ! " she added , thumping the podium in the european commission 's press room .
french officials have systematically dismantled over 100 illegal camps and asked around 1,000 roma people to return to romania .

but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.09.2010 study shows german youth optimistic despite economic gloom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are looking up , despite the economic crisis shell 's sixteenth study on the outlook of german youth shows a surprising rise in optimism for the future .
but the findings also imply a growing gap between the social classes . fifty-nine percent of german youth said they were optimistic about their own future , compared with 50 percent in 2006 when the last shell youth study was conducted .
thirty-three percent said they were undecided and seven percent said their future was poor .
the first such study took place in 1953 and since then has been regularly updated at three or four year intervals . the researchers based their findings on surveys and in-depth interviews with more than 2,500 germans aged between 12 and 25 .
respondents were broken down by age sub-groups , gender and socioeconomic status .
the current generation of youth faces greater uncertainty surrounding economic success and the value of a university degree , said dr. matthias albert , a professor of political science at bielefeld university who was involved in compiling the study .
yet despite that uncertainty and " the mounting pressure on young people in society , they have not only retained their optimism , but it has increased significantly . "
family orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a university degree is less of an assurance of economic success than previously thought the seemingly paradoxical increase in optimism is based on a mix of traditional , more conservative values and modern , progressive values that are more self-centered .
" they have put a stronger emphasis on closer social ties , " albert said .
" they value family to an extraordinary degree .
and this gives them the foundation , so to speak , and the confidence from which they can try to face the challenges before them . "
but while the overall optimism of youth has risen , the study also found that the difference between the outlook of privileged and underprivileged youths is widening .
a third of youths from socially disadvantaged families say their future looks positive - lower than in 2006 - and 40 percent say they are satisfied with their lives .
middle- and upper-class youth are almost twice as likely to express that same satisfaction .
" despite specific measures being taken , we see no evidence whatsoever that this rift is somehow closing , " albert said .
" and that 's the biggest concern , that despite belonging to a generation which is doing rather well , we are somehow losing a small but significant part of it . "
political engagement youth 's interest in politics has increased slightly - 37 percent from 35 percent in 2006 - but it remains much lower than levels in the 1970s and 80s .
however when filtered for age group , political interest declined among youths aged 18 and older and increased significantly for the younger generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet access among young people has become nearly universal in the past eight years , the percentage of 12 to 14 year-olds who express interest in politics has nearly doubled to 21 percent , while the the figure for 15- to 17-year-olds rose from 20 to 33 percent .
beyond that , younger germans are also more likely to say they would engage in political activities like signature campaigns or demonstrations , which albert said is one of the most significant findings of the study .
" the increased political interest among the young , together with their willingness to become politically active suggest to us that we are witnessing the beginning of a new political generation , " he said .

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

" the european commission has strongly criticized the french government for its decision to deport hundreds of roma migrants in recent weeks .
justice commissioner viviane reding said she was appalled by the expulsions and described the policy as a " disgrace . "
" it is shocking that a part of the -lrb- french -rrb- government comes here and says something and another part of the government does the opposite , " she said .
" my patience is wearing thin : enough is enough ! " she added , thumping the podium in the european commission 's press room .

support in germany the commissioner was joined in her attack by the leaders of the roma and sinti community in germany , who criticized french president nicolas sarkozy over the deportation policies , which they said encouraged far-right attitudes .
sarkozy 's policies were " weakening the rule of law and simultaneously making far-right attitudes acceptable in society , " warned the central council of german sinti and roma from its office in the southern city of heidelberg .
the council statement said moves against roma in france risked triggering right-wing violence in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many roma were escorted by police to french airports sarkozy had " deliberately and calculatedly " put the roma under a stigma in a bid to woo rightist french voters , the council added .

" we heard with astonishment mrs viviane reding 's statements , " bernard valero told journalists on tuesday .
" we do not believe that these kinds of statements will improve the fate and situation of the roma , who are at the heart of our preoccupations .
" this is not the time for controversy , nor for statements of this kind , " valero said .
" this is the time to work in favor of the roma population . "

cambodian textile factories produce fabric for clothing chains the world over .
on tuesday , more than 10,000 workers went on strike to demand higher wages . more than 10,000 female workers in cambodia are protesting against the low wages they receive for the hard work they put in everyday .
needless to say , working hours are extremely harsh .
according to workers ' unions , more than 60,000 female workers have refused to work and manufacturing in nearly 40 factories has come to a standstill .
the cambodian newspaper , phnom penh post has reported that 50,000 workers have been prevented by their employers from taking part in the protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a textile factory in cambodia making clothes for the whole world factories in cambodia manufacture sports goods , shoes and clothes for big international brands including german ones like adidas and puma .
the workers are protesting against an agreement between the cambodian government and the industry , according to which the minimum wages for a factory worker have been fixed at us $ 61 a month .
the unions are demanding a minimum salary of us $ 93 .
hang sarith , a 24 year old seamstress says , that with rising prices , she can not support her family on the money she gets now .
" workers like us want a raise of $ 20 a month .
they raised our salaries by just $ 5 .
but we need atleast 10 dollars more to survive .
everything has become so expensive . " female workers in textile factories have been protesting for a long time . last month , there were severe clashes between factory workers and policemen .
the protests came to an end only after the workers leading the protests were dismissed from their jobs .
chea mony , the head of the trade union says : " the police came and put an end to the protests .
this is against the law .
factory workers have a right to participate in strikes and protests .
they simply came and began hitting us .
you can see that in cambodia law and rules do not have any meaning . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western brands like adidas , puma , c & a and h & m manufacture their products in cambodian factories government needs a reality check 30 year old check phary says , the government obviously does not have any idea of how factory workers are suffering : " the government should try and see the situation under which we work and live .
we are in a really bad state because we hardly earn anything .
we can not live off the money we get . "
more than 30 percent of cambodia 's 14 million-strong population live below the poverty line .
nearly 350,000 men and women are employed in textile factories - one of the key industries driving the economy .
employers believe that the industry could face grave losses in the wake of these strikes .

the story is just the latest twist in an ongoing scandal surrounding france 's richest woman . french daily newspaper le monde has accused the office of president nicolas sarkozy of breaching press freedom in a leak investigation .
france 's most famous newspaper stated in a front-page editorial monday it was suing for alleged " violation of the secrecy of sources . "
the paper accused the president 's office of ordering a probe into its reporting of alleged illegal party funding by france 's richest woman , l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt .
le monde claimed the president 's office broke a law designed to protect whistleblowers who leak information to the press .
elysee denies accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bettencourt affair has been dubbed ' sarkogate ' sarkozy 's office firmly rejected le monde 's claims .
" the presidency … never gave any instructions to any service at all , " an elysee spokesperson told news agency afp . france 's national police chief meanwhile confirmed that a ministerial aide had been accused of releasing restricted information .
frederic pechenard said evidence against the suspect was collected through a " legitimate investigation of the origin of leaks " performed under the auspices of the domestic intelligence service 's " mission to protect the security of institutions . "
the leak probe is only the latest episode in a case surrounding bettencourt , who has been linked to alleged illegal funding of sarkozy 's campaign in a scandal that has embroiled sarkozy 's labor minister , eric woerth .
' elysee tried to silence the press ' le monde accused the government of trying to silence reports on the l 'oreal affair and said it had filed suit after being told by police sources that intelligence officers had studied the telephone records of a justice ministry official to find out if he had spoken to reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's pension reforms have sparked nationwide protest " the counter-espionage service was used to find the source of one of our reporters , " the paper 's news director sylvie kauffmann wrote in a front page article titled " the elysee broke the law on protecting press sources . "
sarkozy 's popularity rating is already close to a record low , as france faces a new round of nationwide union strikes on september 23 against the president 's proposed pension reforms .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .

germany is one of the most knowledge-intensive and innovative countries on earth .
in this study we focus on the innovative performance of its sixteen federal states with reference to eight indicators .
the most innovative states lie in the south , while the east trails in terms of absolute levels .
however , interdisciplinarity and regional industrial diversity cushion negative effects of structural change on the regions and offer alternative sources of sustained economic growth .
looking at the dynamic of innovation it is apparent that the states in the east of germany spearheaded by saxony are on the right course . german residential property : back in fashion with good reason ?
the low number of completions , germany 's quick economic recovery , low interest rates and the fact that many investors are looking for low-risk investment products have led to a small boom in some subsegments of the residential property market .
prices are on the rise for prime inner-city locations especially in the major conurbations .
bargains can also be found in numerous attractive medium-sized towns and cities such as well-established university towns .
on average , house prices in germany look set to rise by roughly 1.5 % p.a. over the next two years .
the positive outlook should not , however , render investors blind to the specific investment risks : real estate is always an investment in a particular region or area , making it vulnerable to changes in regional economic structures and the related demographic changes . germany : only modest decline in the current account surplus the german export momentum is currently benefiting from extremely dynamic world trade .
however , it is likely to ease significantly in h2 2010 and above all in 2011 .
in addition to the impact of this cyclical development the highly export-dependent german economy is also being hit by the adjustments in europe ’ s crisis-ridden countries , even though the strain on the german current account is likely to remain within bounds .
nevertheless , in the medium term germany ’ s large current account surplus needs to be reduced , as the origins of the crisis lay in undesirable structural developments on both sides , that is not only in current account deficits , but also in the reciprocal surpluses .
all in all , we expect that the german current account surplus will first widen from 5.0 % to 5 ½ % of gdp this year , before narrowing slowly , however .
in 2012 it could then stand at 4 ½ % . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .

a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .

he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .
ma at least is convinced .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .

but many of the nation 's citizens believe public corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the government 's anti-poverty programs . the millennium development campaign reports that poverty in the developing world has dropped by 19 percent during the past 20 years , putting it on track to halve poverty by 2015 . yet there are nations in the world - the un calls them " least developed countries " -lrb- ldcs -rrb- - that have not experienced the rapid reduction in the number of poor seen , for example , in china .
uganda is one of these ldcs .

the ugandan government , led by president yoweri museveni , has implemented programs like the national agricultural advisory service -lrb- naads -rrb- to help people - especially farmers - in desperate financial situations like nambooze .
the program should facilitate the acquisition of new livestock and better feed by farmers .
but naads faces hurdles that prevent the rural poor from receiving the help they seek .

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

international cooperation , members of the general assembly said , would usher in healthier lives , dramatically lower poverty rates and universal access to education around the globe . but with just five years left before the 2015 deadline , the results are mixed .
tremendous progress in reducing poverty has been made , primarily as a result of the rapid economic growth in china and india .

as unemployment rises globally , the number of working poor has grown , with many former wage and salary employees falling into underemployment and unpaid work in the home .
the growth in unemployment coupled with a spike in food prices during 2008 has left 13 million more people hungry than in 1990 . " it does n't mean that we are going to meet each and every goal in each and every country , " herfkens said .

but he said a flaw in the way the goals were established has hindered countries ' ability to meet them . " the question , ' what exactly are the prerequisites so we can reach this ? ' was not posed , " flassbeck told deutsche welle .

they were created as non-binding agreements , so when a goal is not reached , neither nations as a whole nor people in positions of responsibility face any consequences . despite the setbacks , the goals have helped build awareness globally about poverty in the developing world .
herfkens said she believes the goals also created a sense of urgency in the development community that has helped improve living standards for millions of people . " this agreement is beautiful , and we need it more than ever , " herfkens said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2010 merkel to revive germany 's quest for security council seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's campaign for a permanent seat has floundered german chancellor angela merkel is expected to use her upcoming visit to new york for a united nations development summit to resurrect germany 's flagging campaign for a non-permanent seat on the un security council . merkel and her foreign minister guido westerwelle travel to new york this weekend for meetings to discuss the progress of the united nations ' millennium development goals and the action to be taken in the five years remaining before its 2015 deadline .
as well as addressing development issues during the september 20-22 summit , merkel and westerwelle will also use the new york trip to once again push for germany 's consideration as a rotating permanent member of the united nations security council as part of their wider plan for un reform .
in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany would be wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

where am i going , and what is life all about anyway ? " the notion of being gone when you die - i do n't find that so terrible .
i think it 's much worse to be separated from the people you care for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 14.09.2010 german clubs could lift bundesliga above italy in uefa rankings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's internationals are even more a german-italian dogfight six german teams are bidding for glory as the champions and europa leagues get underway in earnest .
but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

the guitar bard is back with a sophomore album that strengthens his reputation for crafting unpretentious poetry in song . a wandering minstrel by nature , philipp poisel 's days as a struggling street musician took a turn when german music legend herbert groenemeyer signed him to his label , groenland records .
after cutting a successful debut in 2008 , the up-and-coming guitar bard now delivers a sophomore album that strengthens his reputation for writing down-to-earth but poetic tunes .
named " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , the album is commanding critical acclaim . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring philipp poisel . deutsche welle : your sound does n't easily fit into any one musical category .
do you see yourself as a kind of pioneer in germany ?
philipp poisel : it 's not at all my aim to carve out a new niche or characterize my music as such .
if someone says otherwise , i 'd disagree .
the music is a product of everything - my voice , lyrics and feelings .
this is simply what has come of it , call it what you may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert groenemeyer has been topping german charts for decades what kind of music are you listening to at the moment ?
i like original things .
i have an old cd i like a lot and listen to often .
funny , it 's by a sardinian men 's choir .
i have no idea what they 're singing , but they do a lot with their voices : very original , raw and deep .
that ’ s just one example .
there 's quite a range and no particular emphasis in any one direction . you 're signed to groenland records , the label founded by herbert groenemeyer .
what 's it like to work with him ? we chat on occasion .
and his whole heart is in it .
but he does n't watch me like a hawk .
he gives me a lot of freedom , partly because he 's also familiar with the standpoint from the artist 's perspective . the title of your second album , " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , and your last name , poisel , have a francophile touch .
do you have french forefathers ? there are some french roots way back in my family history , so that 's where the name comes from , but the title of the album has nothing to do with my name .
it could have been another country really , but i think france is fantastic .
france has such extremes .
it 's so different from north to south .
my parents often took me there on vacation so i have a lot of childhood memories .
for me france is synonymous with simplicity and light-heartedness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poisel has a soft spot for france - especially for toulouse for some , the name of the record might sound like a soundtrack to a catchy road movie , but listening to the music on it is more reminiscent of a reflective road trip ...
absolutely !
often i can best reflect on my life , my past and my future while i 'm driving .
with the car going down the road my thoughts take flight .
and if i 'm at home and my thoughts start to go in circles and get tied up in knots , i need to get out on the road and leave everything behind .

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?

a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

the guitar bard is back with a sophomore album that strengthens his reputation for crafting unpretentious poetry in song . a wandering minstrel by nature , philipp poisel 's days as a struggling street musician took a turn when german music legend herbert groenemeyer signed him to his label , groenland records .
after cutting a successful debut in 2008 , the up-and-coming guitar bard now delivers a sophomore album that strengthens his reputation for writing down-to-earth but poetic tunes .
named " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , the album is commanding critical acclaim . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring philipp poisel . deutsche welle : your sound does n't easily fit into any one musical category .
do you see yourself as a kind of pioneer in germany ?
philipp poisel : it 's not at all my aim to carve out a new niche or characterize my music as such .
if someone says otherwise , i 'd disagree .
the music is a product of everything - my voice , lyrics and feelings .
this is simply what has come of it , call it what you may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert groenemeyer has been topping german charts for decades what kind of music are you listening to at the moment ?
i like original things .
i have an old cd i like a lot and listen to often .
funny , it 's by a sardinian men 's choir .
i have no idea what they 're singing , but they do a lot with their voices : very original , raw and deep .
that ’ s just one example .
there 's quite a range and no particular emphasis in any one direction . you 're signed to groenland records , the label founded by herbert groenemeyer .
what 's it like to work with him ? we chat on occasion .
and his whole heart is in it .
but he does n't watch me like a hawk .
he gives me a lot of freedom , partly because he 's also familiar with the standpoint from the artist 's perspective . the title of your second album , " bis nach toulouse " -lrb- " all the way to toulouse " -rrb- , and your last name , poisel , have a francophile touch .
do you have french forefathers ? there are some french roots way back in my family history , so that 's where the name comes from , but the title of the album has nothing to do with my name .
it could have been another country really , but i think france is fantastic .
france has such extremes .
it 's so different from north to south .
my parents often took me there on vacation so i have a lot of childhood memories .
for me france is synonymous with simplicity and light-heartedness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poisel has a soft spot for france - especially for toulouse for some , the name of the record might sound like a soundtrack to a catchy road movie , but listening to the music on it is more reminiscent of a reflective road trip ...
absolutely !
often i can best reflect on my life , my past and my future while i 'm driving .
with the car going down the road my thoughts take flight .
and if i 'm at home and my thoughts start to go in circles and get tied up in knots , i need to get out on the road and leave everything behind .
that gives my life a new horizon . last year , you thought you were terminally ill when doctors discovered a tumor .
fortunately the diagnosis turned out to be wrong .
how did that impact your album ?
that experience was n't the linchpin behind the record .
it played a role , for example in writing the track " froh dabei zu sein " -lrb- " happy to be part of it " -rrb- , but that song is the result of a story that goes back even further .
i 'd never been in such an unfortunate situation before and forced to come to terms with life and death .
but even before that i 'd asked questions like , " where do i come from ?
where am i going , and what is life all about anyway ? " the notion of being gone when you die - i do n't find that so terrible .
i think it 's much worse to be separated from the people you care for .
the converse side of that is that i 'm incredibly glad to have been able to meet these people , that they 're a part of my life and that i could have that experience .
i would n't want to have missed it .
so , i 'm happy that my life exists . interview : deborah friedman editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

curtain up ...
germany is one of the most knowledge-intensive and innovative countries on earth .
in this study we focus on the innovative performance of its sixteen federal states with reference to eight indicators .
the most innovative states lie in the south , while the east trails in terms of absolute levels .
however , interdisciplinarity and regional industrial diversity cushion negative effects of structural change on the regions and offer alternative sources of sustained economic growth .
looking at the dynamic of innovation it is apparent that the states in the east of germany spearheaded by saxony are on the right course . german residential property : back in fashion with good reason ?
the low number of completions , germany 's quick economic recovery , low interest rates and the fact that many investors are looking for low-risk investment products have led to a small boom in some subsegments of the residential property market .
prices are on the rise for prime inner-city locations especially in the major conurbations .
bargains can also be found in numerous attractive medium-sized towns and cities such as well-established university towns .
on average , house prices in germany look set to rise by roughly 1.5 % p.a. over the next two years .
the positive outlook should not , however , render investors blind to the specific investment risks : real estate is always an investment in a particular region or area , making it vulnerable to changes in regional economic structures and the related demographic changes . germany : only modest decline in the current account surplus the german export momentum is currently benefiting from extremely dynamic world trade .
however , it is likely to ease significantly in h2 2010 and above all in 2011 .
in addition to the impact of this cyclical development the highly export-dependent german economy is also being hit by the adjustments in europe ’ s crisis-ridden countries , even though the strain on the german current account is likely to remain within bounds .
nevertheless , in the medium term germany ’ s large current account surplus needs to be reduced , as the origins of the crisis lay in undesirable structural developments on both sides , that is not only in current account deficits , but also in the reciprocal surpluses .
all in all , we expect that the german current account surplus will first widen from 5.0 % to 5 ½ % of gdp this year , before narrowing slowly , however .
in 2012 it could then stand at 4 ½ % . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .
ma at least is convinced .
whether the government and the other farmers will come around remains an open question . note : all names in this article have been changed to protect those involved . author : kristin kupfer -lrb- sk -rrb- editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many of the nation 's citizens believe public corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the government 's anti-poverty programs . the millennium development campaign reports that poverty in the developing world has dropped by 19 percent during the past 20 years , putting it on track to halve poverty by 2015 . yet there are nations in the world - the un calls them " least developed countries " -lrb- ldcs -rrb- - that have not experienced the rapid reduction in the number of poor seen , for example , in china .
uganda is one of these ldcs .
as a landlocked nation , its development prospects already face major challenges .
but according to some ugandans , there is also a human problem that is preventing significant reductions in poverty : public corruption .
ineffective programs caroline nambooze has not seen much in the way of government help .
she breaks rocks for a living in a stone quarry located outside of uganda 's capital kampala .
it provides construction material for the country 's blossoming construction industry .
two of nambooze 's children died of malaria .
she can barely send her surviving daughter to school with the $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- she earns a month .
" i buy a piece of rock , and i break it into little pieces , " nambooze said .
" that helps me earn money for housing , groceries and the school fees for my only living child . "
the ugandan government , led by president yoweri museveni , has implemented programs like the national agricultural advisory service -lrb- naads -rrb- to help people - especially farmers - in desperate financial situations like nambooze .
the program should facilitate the acquisition of new livestock and better feed by farmers .
but naads faces hurdles that prevent the rural poor from receiving the help they seek .
" i do n't go to naads because i do n't have enough money , " said jane rose kasukari , a farmer and widowed mother of eight children .
" i was told that i had to pay cash to register , and i could profit from the program later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nyanzi blames public corruption for the ineffectiveness of anti-poverty measures the government also set up a program called prosperity for all .
it planned to raise the living standards of ugandans by providing them with cheap credit distributed through local cooperatives .
but like naads , its implementation has been problematic .
" the progress report of the un millennium development goals showed a mixed picture of the condition of the programs in uganda , " deo nyanzi , manager of the uganda national ngo forum , told deutsche welle .
" the widespread corruption at high levels is responsible for the failure of president yoweri museveni 's policies . "
ugandans losing faith in government because these public programs have not delivered , many ugandans are losing faith in their government and hope in the future .
" i do n't think that the government does enough to fight poverty , " jill kyatuhaire kesha , the manager of the westminster institute for democracy , told deutsche welle .
" the government does not put enough resources in critical areas because it sets the wrong priorities . "
and derrick twinomugisha , an ad agent with the firm ogilvy , said he believes he knows where government 's priorities lie - in its own welfare .

but as the deadline approaches , some experts are questioning whether the goals can be accomplished by then . some 200 nations gathered at the un in new york in september 2000 and openly committed themselves to creating a more just world and set eight targets for themselves to reach by 2015 .
international cooperation , members of the general assembly said , would usher in healthier lives , dramatically lower poverty rates and universal access to education around the globe . but with just five years left before the 2015 deadline , the results are mixed .
tremendous progress in reducing poverty has been made , primarily as a result of the rapid economic growth in china and india .
the poverty rate in the developing world dropped 19 percent between 1990 and 2005 . such progress has left some experts optimistic about how much will be accomplished in the next five years . substantial progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty in china " i am amazed about how much progress there is , " eveline herfkens , founder of the un millennium campaign , told deutsche welle .
" even with the financial crisis , the world is still on track to achieve the first goal .
on goals like do something serious about tuberculosis , like drinking water , there has been tremendous progress , and the world is on track . " yet the economic crisis has created new obstacles .
as unemployment rises globally , the number of working poor has grown , with many former wage and salary employees falling into underemployment and unpaid work in the home .
the growth in unemployment coupled with a spike in food prices during 2008 has left 13 million more people hungry than in 1990 . " it does n't mean that we are going to meet each and every goal in each and every country , " herfkens said .
" but the acceleration that has been created by the momentum of these goals has improved millions and millions of lives . " while real reductions in poverty have occurred in countries like china and india , there are other countries - the so-called " least developed countries " - where virtually no progress has been made . serious setbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis stole political attention from the millennium goals heiner flassbeck , the director of the united nations conference for trade and development -lrb- unctad -rrb- , praised the mdgs as instrumental in building awareness of dire problems .
but he said a flaw in the way the goals were established has hindered countries ' ability to meet them . " the question , ' what exactly are the prerequisites so we can reach this ? ' was not posed , " flassbeck told deutsche welle .
" then the global financial crisis caused a huge setback for the mdgs , partly because this very point was neglected .
in my belief that 's what the un system has to catch up on now . " the goals have also come under criticism because they lack any means of enforcement .
they were created as non-binding agreements , so when a goal is not reached , neither nations as a whole nor people in positions of responsibility face any consequences . despite the setbacks , the goals have helped build awareness globally about poverty in the developing world .
herfkens said she believes the goals also created a sense of urgency in the development community that has helped improve living standards for millions of people . " this agreement is beautiful , and we need it more than ever , " herfkens said .
" with the current crisis , politicians are turning inwards , so we need the millennium goals as a framework to continue to mobilize citizens , educate citizens so they can demand accountability .

the package will put larger burdens on airlines , energy utilities , banks and energy-intensive producers , with the proposals still needing to be detailed in draft legislation by the responsible ministries . the government ’ s legislative proposals – presumably in the shape of a budget accompanying law – will not be tabled until autumn at the earliest , with the bundestag probably also not voting on them until the budget debate .

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.09.2010 german parliament begins ' divisive ' budget debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-day budget debate is expected to be heated the bundestag , germany 's lower house , has begun its debate on the 2011 budget .
the finance ministry is looking to reduce spending drastically but there is opposition as to where those reductions are being made . the bundestag , germany 's lower house , convened this tuesday to begin discussing the budget for 2011 .
according to the finance ministry , spending cuts adding up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- are planned .
germany , like many other countries around europe still dealing with the effects of the financial crisis , is faced with the need to make massive spending cuts to balance its budget .
in june the federal government in berlin proposed an unprecedented package of austerity measures that aim to reduce government spending by 80 billion euros over the next four years .
distribution of austerity the spending cuts have been extensively debated since being proposed .
the criticism , however , is not focused on the amount of the cuts or whether they are necessary , as consensus was reached in june regarding the need to balance the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poss objects to the ' unbalanced ' distribution with that being said , opposition politicians have severely criticized where the planned spending cuts are being made , which will make for continued debate over the next four days among parliamentarians in berlin .
the current head of the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction , joachim poss , said on tuesday ahead of the budget debate the proposed cuts were " socially unbalanced . "
he added : " this is a budget proposal that will further divide our country .
-lsb- the center-right government -rsb- is dividing our country . "
the social democrats argue that social areas are bearing the brunt of the spending cuts , for instance unemployment and child benefits , and that the wealthy are being spared .
from 2010 to 2011 , spending for social benefits will decrease from 54 to 50 percent of the total federal budget . the labor ministry is facing the largest cuts ; it will have 10 percent less funds at its disposal in 2011 compared to this year .
motivation for spending cuts the head of the governing free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- parliamentary faction , birgit homburger , responded to criticism on monday by applauding the government 's desire to rein in the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says spending cuts are hard but necessary she said that the children of germany 's future generations " will not be able to play on mountains of debt , " adding that this was " our motivation for the spending cuts . "
the fdp 's budget expert , otto fricke , echoed homburger 's praise of the government 's austerity package ; however , he added that changes were possible with regard to the distribution of the cuts .
" we will consider any suggestions for improvement of the proposal , insofar as these are concrete alternatives , " fricke said in berlin .
tuesday 's federal budget debate will be followed by discussions of the individual ministerial budgets .
the bundestag is scheduled to pass the overall 2011 budget in late november .

as well as addressing development issues during the september 20-22 summit , merkel and westerwelle will also use the new york trip to once again push for germany 's consideration as a rotating permanent member of the united nations security council as part of their wider plan for un reform .
in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany would be wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .

" not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .

incumbent alexander lukashenko , whom washington dubs " europe 's last dictator " is widely expected to seek a fourth term . the belarusian parliament has set presidential polls for december 19 in which long-time president alexander lukashenko is expected to run for a fourth term .
the date was approved by 108 of 110 members of the parliament , which is dominated by supporters of lukashenko , who has ruled the former soviet republic with an iron fist since 1994 .
after being famously described by washington as europe 's last dictator , lukashenko has made attempts at greater openness .
this has resulted in a sharp deterioration in relations with russia , which could complicate lukashenko 's efforts to secure a landslide victory , as he did in each of belarus ' previous three presidential elections .

the organisation soon became the symbol of the cartel model .
are cartels intrinsically bad ? half a century ago iran , iraq , kuwait , saudi arabia and venezuela created the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- - an organization that quickly became the modern symbol of the cartel model that many governments around the world have outlawed .
cartels were n't always illegal in germany , however .
in 1905 , the country had 385 officially registered cartels , formed between a total of 12,000 companies .
after world war i , the number of cartels rose even higher – to 3,500 – making germany " a kingdom of cartels . "
it was only after world war ii that numerous policymakers and economists expressed concerns about the threat cartels posed to the very foundations of a free market economy by essentially undermining the competition needed to supply people with goods and services at reasonable prices .
in 1957 , germany introduced its first cartel laws – very much against industry opposition .
" cartels usually serve their founders ' interests , " said daniel zimmer , director of the institute for trade and commercial law at the bonn university and a member of the german monopoly commission , which supervises free competition on behalf of the german government .
" the founders agree on higher prices or on reducing supply and , in the end , consumers have a disadvantage .
that 's why cartels are basically banned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartel expert daniel zimmer says there are exceptions to every ban even with laws in place , companies have continued their price-fixing activities .
according to the federal cartel authority in bonn , detecting such arrangements between companies helps prevent damage worth 500 and 750 million euros annually .
these are conservative calculations , based on the assumption that companies agreeing to fix prices set them about 10 percent higher than the market price .
studies have revealed , however , that cartels can easily add another 25 percent to market prices .
cartel ban - with exceptions in theory , cartels should not exist in the first place because of a self-destructive element inherent in them : companies able to sell their goods at a higher price are inclined to increase supply to make yet more profit .
but greater supply translates into lower prices , despite cartel arrangements .
the most prominent example is opec , which currently consists of 12 oil-producing nations .
critics point out that member states have seldom adhered to negotiated production quotas , and that market prices have rarely matched the cartel 's targets , giving the group a reputation for being a toothless tiger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say opec members rarely meet their own targets are there cartels that serve a good purpose ?
" cartels are banned in principle , but principles can come with exceptions , " zimmer said .
" there are exceptions to all cartels that allow principles to be broken under strict conditions . "
he cited research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- as an example of where fixing arrangements could help save resources because companies would n't necessarily need to " reinvent the wheel " every time they launch a new project .
" european competition protection law foresees exceptions from the cartel ban wherever arrangements serve to promote technical or economic progress or help improve the production of goods or consumer supply . "
a key requirement , however , is that savings achieved through the arrangements must actually benefit consumers .
" you have to rely on forecasts to determine whether this is the case , but forecasts are tied to market conditions , " zimmer said .
in highly competitive markets , he added , benefits gained through a " rationalising cartel " would more likely be passed on to the next market level than in markets with less competition .
is a " good cartel " possible ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could cartels help secure global food supply ?
one could think of " good cartels " in which arrangements between companies help guarantee supply of agricultural products , for instance .
a current example : speculation has fueled wheat and cocoa prices - a development that has nothing to do with real scarcity .
to combat this trend , russian minister of agriculture , alexej gordejew , has lobbied for the foundation of a so-called " crop-opec " .
bonn-based agricultural economist joachim von braun thinks along the same lines , but avoids the term " cartel " because of its negative connotation .
he prefers the term " international crop reserve bank . "
this body would be run by a club of crop-exporting countries interested in promoting a functioning global food supply system .
by adjusting price fluctuations , they would spoil speculators ' appetites to tamper with the market .
cartel expert zimmer believes current laws would not , in principle , ban such arrangements .
" if countries agree to buy and sell crops together , this activity would have to be viewed , initially , under cartel laws .
whether such activity should be banned or viewed as an exception to the rule would then have to be assessed in detail . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 14.09.2010 french senate approves burqa ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer than 2,000 women wear the full-face veil in france the french parliament passed a law tuesday prohibiting the wearing of a full-face veil in public .
the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .

a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .
government scientists are expected to announce the results of their tests soon .

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "

is it because they 're difficult characters ?
east german ?
or is it just how history played out ? " relatively few of us ended up going the distance in politics , " says markus meckel , a one-time dissident who served as east germany 's foreign minister for five months in 1990 .
a social democrat member of parliament from 1990 until he lost his seat to the left party last year , meckel was one of just a handful of east german activists who went on to carve a niche for himself in pan-german politics .
i meet up with him in a cafe in schoeneberg , in former west berlin .
he arrives on a bike and tells me that he 's only just moved here from the apartment near the bundestag he used to rent .
coincidentally , the radio starts playing the smash 1990 hit " winds of change " by german rock band scorpions as we sit down - a song that will be forever associated with the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe .
" the thing was , being part of an opposition movement during communism required very different qualities and skills to those required to hold political office in a democracy in which the media plays a major role , " he explains .
" what we wanted was to bring about change , and it was n't as though we 'd set out to pursue political careers .
the fact that this change happened was enough for many of us .
i myself only decided to run as a candidate for the bundestag after talking to willy brandt -lrb- editor 's note : chancellor of west germany from 1969-1974 , and leader of the social democratic party from 1964-1987 -rrb- .
he said that a reunified germany would need people with my background . "
but the oppositionists soon found themselves overtaken by events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- with his west german counterpart hans-dietrich genscher " when all 's said and done , the opposition was a tiny minority of the east german population , " meckel says .
" there were only about three or 5,000 of us .
but there were lots of people who were unhappy under communism , who did n't express their dissatisfaction , but who then took the opportunity to grasp change when they were presented with it .
they were the real motor of the whole process , and when they voted in the country 's first free elections for the volkskammer -lrb- people 's chamber -rrb- in march 1990 , it was less an exercise in democracy and more of a referendum on reunification .
the center-right west german government joined forces with its sister parties in the east , and these were block parties who were under the thumb of the communist socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- .
they were conformists .
they were n't the opposition .
but they stood for reunification , and they got the votes . "
misjudging the mood so despite their key role in toppling communism , few former east german renegades entered the bundestag after the first parliamentary elections in reunified germany in late 1990 .
one of them was vera wollenberger , who later reverted to her maiden name of lengsfeld after finding out that her husband had informed on her to the stasi secret police .
initially a member of alliance 90 / the greens , she switched to the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 1996 when the greens started getting too cozy with the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the successor party to the sed .
but she most recently made waves with an election poster last year that featured her and angela merkel showing a lot of cleavage .
" we have more to offer , " was the message .
she 's always been good at gauging the zeitgeist - a quality that goes some way to explaining why she was one of the few east german dissidents to secure not just one but three consecutive bundestag mandates .
like meckel , she says that if oppositionists were short-changed during the reunification process , it was because they failed to recognize the public mood .
" most of the civil rights activists had been pursuing the wrong goals , " she explains over coffee in her spacious apartment in the berlin district of pankow , a cradle of east germany 's opposition movement .
" they were barking up the wrong tree , pushing not for an end to the gdr , but for its democratic reform .
none of us realized that the cold war would be over so fast .
we thought the iron curtain would become more transparent , but we never expected it to collapse in our entire lifetimes .
lots of dissidents just did n't have their eye on the ball . "
sidelined the bundestag elections in 1990 brought a clear victory for chancellor helmut kohl 's christian democrat-free democrat coalition government , and the immediate post-reunification years saw christian democrats from former west germany stepping into the breach as premiers of one eastern german state after the other .
according to arnold vaatz , another erstwhile oppositionist who served as saxony 's environment minister until 1998 and is now the vice chairman of the cdu faction in the german parliament , this was symptomatic of a wider trend : former dissidents or otherwise , east germans have been routinely sidelined from senior positions in the last 20 years , he says .
not just in politics .
" by definition , east germans can not meet the requirements of certain positions because they inevitably do n't have the qualifications , " he told me in his broad saxon accent .
" suitability for leadership is necessarily judged according to criteria drawn up in west germany , so people born and bred in the east have been pushed aside .
they do n't stand a chance of getting into top positions , and these have fallen irrevocably into west german hands .
east germans are out of the loop . "
affirmative action but vaatz is quick to praise helmut kohl 's efforts to support politicians from the former east during his chancellorship in the 1990s .
" he 's never really been given his due on that front , " he says .
and the obvious exception to vaatz 's perceived rule is the chancellor , who used to be known as " kohl 's girl . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel joined the opposition in 1989 markus meckel argues that angela merkel would never have become chancellor without kohl 's support .
hardly a dissident , she joined the democratic awakening -lrb- demokratischer aufbruch -rrb- some months after it was formed in 1989 , entering the opposition " only when it was no longer dangerous , " as lengsfeld dryly puts it .
but she was in the right place at the right time .
" she was clearly a product of kohl 's affirmative action approach , " says meckel .
the irony , he adds , is that she herself has never made her roots an issue .
" everyone expects her to represent eastern germany , but the reality is , she does n't , " says meckel .
" the former east has never been a focus of her leadership because it would jeopardize her popularity .
ultimately , she 's sacrificed the problems of eastern germany in the interests of furthering her own career . "
vaatz refuses to be drawn on this issue , but he admits he 's irked by the absence of east germans in merkel 's cabinet .
" i do believe there are east germans with potential within the cdu who have not been promoted , " he says .
taking charge of their own destinies vera lengsfeld , meanwhile , rejects out of hand the idea that eastern germany and its politicians have ever been disadvantaged .
" refusing to focus on east germany is one of the few things merkel 's done right ! " she says .
" it 's only a quarter of the country , and in the last 20 years , it 's where all the money has gone .
funds are ploughed into the eastern states while the roads in the ruhr valley are going to rack and ruin .
east germany was utterly bankrupt in 1989 and its prosperity has grown steadily over the last 20 years .
its infrastructure is better than it is in the west - these days , you know when you 've crossed the former border because the roads suddenly get bad ! "
she thinks it 's time to put a stop to the government 's reconstruction aid .
" i appreciate how much it helped , but it resulted in a generation of politicians who ca n't do anything but put their hands out , " she rails .
" they need to take charge of their own destinies .
there are n't any east germans in merkel 's cabinet because there are n't any out there right now who are up to the job . " bildunterschrift : the cdu was the main winner of the first pan-german elections in 1990 personally , she hates the idea of affirmative action .
" you should be judged on your performance alone , " she insists .
she dismisses negative campaigns in saxony and thuringia ahead of the elections last year that sought to undermine ' imported ' candidates .
" people just want good politicians ; they do n't care where they come from .
it 's only the left party that keeps harping on about east-west differences - young people are n't interested , " she says . she herself attributes the longevity of her bundestag career , which lasted until 2005 , to her ability to win over the party basis - perhaps a leftover from her days as a civil rights activist .
not team players if there 's one thing that these one-time dissidents agree on , it 's that they are their own people .
even if there may have been a time when the dissident label was a badge of honor that could open certain doors , " mainstream parties were never very keen on us , " recalls lengsfeld with a smile .
" we were always seen as too edgy , too independent .
we do n't follow orders .
we 're not foot soldiers . "
but as meckel points out , their very individuality might have worked against them .
" if you look at those of us who held high positions over the years , like wolfgang thierse , the current deputy president of the bundestag , there 's always been an inability to bundle eastern german interests .
across the board , there 's never been any consensus on how to strategically position the eastern states , and that 's largely up to the political players operating there .
you ca n't say they were n't given a chance .
to some extent , they themselves never understood their roles . "

but many of the nation 's citizens believe public corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the government 's anti-poverty programs . the millennium development campaign reports that poverty in the developing world has dropped by 19 percent during the past 20 years , putting it on track to halve poverty by 2015 . yet there are nations in the world - the un calls them " least developed countries " -lrb- ldcs -rrb- - that have not experienced the rapid reduction in the number of poor seen , for example , in china .
uganda is one of these ldcs .
as a landlocked nation , its development prospects already face major challenges .
but according to some ugandans , there is also a human problem that is preventing significant reductions in poverty : public corruption .
ineffective programs caroline nambooze has not seen much in the way of government help .
she breaks rocks for a living in a stone quarry located outside of uganda 's capital kampala .
it provides construction material for the country 's blossoming construction industry .
two of nambooze 's children died of malaria .
she can barely send her surviving daughter to school with the $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- she earns a month .
" i buy a piece of rock , and i break it into little pieces , " nambooze said .
" that helps me earn money for housing , groceries and the school fees for my only living child . "
the ugandan government , led by president yoweri museveni , has implemented programs like the national agricultural advisory service -lrb- naads -rrb- to help people - especially farmers - in desperate financial situations like nambooze .
the program should facilitate the acquisition of new livestock and better feed by farmers .
but naads faces hurdles that prevent the rural poor from receiving the help they seek .

but many of the nation 's citizens believe public corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the government 's anti-poverty programs . the millennium development campaign reports that poverty in the developing world has dropped by 19 percent during the past 20 years , putting it on track to halve poverty by 2015 . yet there are nations in the world - the un calls them " least developed countries " -lrb- ldcs -rrb- - that have not experienced the rapid reduction in the number of poor seen , for example , in china .
uganda is one of these ldcs .
as a landlocked nation , its development prospects already face major challenges .
but according to some ugandans , there is also a human problem that is preventing significant reductions in poverty : public corruption .
ineffective programs caroline nambooze has not seen much in the way of government help .
she breaks rocks for a living in a stone quarry located outside of uganda 's capital kampala .
it provides construction material for the country 's blossoming construction industry .
two of nambooze 's children died of malaria .
she can barely send her surviving daughter to school with the $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- she earns a month .
" i buy a piece of rock , and i break it into little pieces , " nambooze said .
" that helps me earn money for housing , groceries and the school fees for my only living child . "
the ugandan government , led by president yoweri museveni , has implemented programs like the national agricultural advisory service -lrb- naads -rrb- to help people - especially farmers - in desperate financial situations like nambooze .
the program should facilitate the acquisition of new livestock and better feed by farmers .
but naads faces hurdles that prevent the rural poor from receiving the help they seek .

but many of the nation 's citizens believe public corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the government 's anti-poverty programs . the millennium development campaign reports that poverty in the developing world has dropped by 19 percent during the past 20 years , putting it on track to halve poverty by 2015 . yet there are nations in the world - the un calls them " least developed countries " -lrb- ldcs -rrb- - that have not experienced the rapid reduction in the number of poor seen , for example , in china .
uganda is one of these ldcs .

" i buy a piece of rock , and i break it into little pieces , " nambooze said .

the ugandan government , led by president yoweri museveni , has implemented programs like the national agricultural advisory service -lrb- naads -rrb- to help people - especially farmers - in desperate financial situations like nambooze .
the program should facilitate the acquisition of new livestock and better feed by farmers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 14.09.2010 conscription in germany set to be consigned to history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr will be " smaller but more efficient " after more than 50 years of conscription , germany 's bundeswehr is on the brink of turning into an all-volunteer army .
leading government officials have signalled their approval of the reform plans . the executive committee of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- appears prepared to support defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg 's plans to reform the german army , the bundeswehr .
the proposals could see the bundeswehr turned into a volunteer army , after 50 years of conscription .
under the defense minister 's proposals , germany would suspend conscription , but retain it in the constitution .
the army would then only accept some 7,500 volunteers for between 12 to 23 months .
young men would retain the status of conscripts , but they would not be drafted .
guttenberg said that despite the plans , the cdu would remain the " party of the bundeswehr and of security , " adding that the move was not a shift away from the party ’ s traditional , conservative values .
cdu secretary general hermann groehe said the party 's executive committee had not taken a decision yet , but had shown a " great openness " for guttenberg 's plans .
the chancellor 's coalition partner in the government , the free democrats , welcomed the cdu committee 's decision at a meeting late on monday .
a revolutionary reform previously opposed to the minister 's reform plans , the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , has also signalled its agreement .
a difference of opinion remains , however , as csu leader horst seehofer demands that conscription should be completely abolished , not just discontinued . in addition , guttenberg wants to slash troop levels from about 245,000 today to about 164,000 troops in the future .
the result would be what he has termed a " smaller but better army , more effectively equipped for operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could be history in less than a year the armed forces are controlled by parliament the reform is needed to meet savings the government wants to impose on the military over the next four years .
guttenberg made a renewed appeal for his reform plans in the würzburger tagespost newspaper monday edition .
conscription has a grand tradition , he said .
" but it has shriveled and is now only a shadow of its former self . "
twenty years ago , west germans served 18 months in the army or in social services if they were conscientious objectors .
today , the length of military service has dropped to six months and only about 16 percent of those of military age actually serve .
should party members at the cdu and csu annual conventions later this year go along with the proposals , conscription in the german bundeswehr could be discontinued as early as july 2011 .

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

incumbent alexander lukashenko , whom washington dubs " europe 's last dictator " is widely expected to seek a fourth term . the belarusian parliament has set presidential polls for december 19 in which long-time president alexander lukashenko is expected to run for a fourth term .
the date was approved by 108 of 110 members of the parliament , which is dominated by supporters of lukashenko , who has ruled the former soviet republic with an iron fist since 1994 .
after being famously described by washington as europe 's last dictator , lukashenko has made attempts at greater openness .
this has resulted in a sharp deterioration in relations with russia , which could complicate lukashenko 's efforts to secure a landslide victory , as he did in each of belarus ' previous three presidential elections .

cambodian textile factories produce fabric for clothing chains the world over .
on tuesday , more than 10,000 workers went on strike to demand higher wages . more than 10,000 female workers in cambodia are protesting against the low wages they receive for the hard work they put in everyday .
needless to say , working hours are extremely harsh .
according to workers ' unions , more than 60,000 female workers have refused to work and manufacturing in nearly 40 factories has come to a standstill .
the cambodian newspaper , phnom penh post has reported that 50,000 workers have been prevented by their employers from taking part in the protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a textile factory in cambodia making clothes for the whole world factories in cambodia manufacture sports goods , shoes and clothes for big international brands including german ones like adidas and puma .
the workers are protesting against an agreement between the cambodian government and the industry , according to which the minimum wages for a factory worker have been fixed at us $ 61 a month .
the unions are demanding a minimum salary of us $ 93 .
hang sarith , a 24 year old seamstress says , that with rising prices , she can not support her family on the money she gets now .
" workers like us want a raise of $ 20 a month .
they raised our salaries by just $ 5 .
but we need atleast 10 dollars more to survive .
everything has become so expensive . " female workers in textile factories have been protesting for a long time . last month , there were severe clashes between factory workers and policemen .
the protests came to an end only after the workers leading the protests were dismissed from their jobs .
chea mony , the head of the trade union says : " the police came and put an end to the protests .
this is against the law .
factory workers have a right to participate in strikes and protests .
they simply came and began hitting us .
you can see that in cambodia law and rules do not have any meaning . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western brands like adidas , puma , c & a and h & m manufacture their products in cambodian factories government needs a reality check 30 year old check phary says , the government obviously does not have any idea of how factory workers are suffering : " the government should try and see the situation under which we work and live .
we are in a really bad state because we hardly earn anything .
we can not live off the money we get . "
more than 30 percent of cambodia 's 14 million-strong population live below the poverty line .
nearly 350,000 men and women are employed in textile factories - one of the key industries driving the economy .
employers believe that the industry could face grave losses in the wake of these strikes .
other than cambodia , workers in many asian countries including china and bangladesh have been protesting against deteriorating working conditions and low wages in factories which manufacture goods for western countries .

they are organizing a ' cab camp ' to further the technology next month . london 's black cab drivers are famous for having to learn " the knowledge , " which is essentially memorizing and being able to navigate all of the city 's streets .
however , over the last several months , a small subset of this closely-knit tribe has started to add another tool - twitter - as a way to make it easier for drivers and customers to find each other .
for now , organizers say , @ tweetalondoncab is the only tweetable cab service in the united kingdom , and possibly even the world .
" we got quite a few requests asking us if we 'd take ' tweet ' bookings , " said lee cox , one of the organizers .
" two of the guys decided to give it a go and that 's how @ tweetalondoncab was born . "
setting the wheels in motion it all began in early 2010 as just another online social network community : a twitter group for london taxi drivers to chat and share information about work opportunities and hotspots , traffic and road-works , bargain car part stores and coffee-break meet-ups . but the account soon attracted followers who were cab users rather than cab drivers .
there are now 115 members of the collective , which is managed entirely by the drivers .
so far , they have over 8,000 followers and 100 regular clients - that 's still an extreme minority of the 25,000 licensed black cabs in the english capital .
at the moment , cox says that only about five percent of his business comes in through twitter , but he adds , it 's growing at a rapid pace .
for the hundreds of people who use the service , the booking system works by prospective customers following @ tweetalondoncab 's twitter account , which then follows them back .
after that , they can send a direct message with details of their request .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers follow @ tweetalondoncab and then can communicate with the drivers privately via " direct message " " we use direct message because it 's more secure and ensures privacy , " lee cox told deutsche welle .
" nothing is passed on the open twitter streams that people can see so no-one knows where you 're going to and from . "
the drivers are n't sending the tweets directly from the cabs .
the cabbies in this group take turns doing online shifts at home , reading incoming messages and then passing on the relevant ones to the drivers .
lee cox himself does five two-hour stints a week at home in front of his computer but says the investment of personal time is well worthwhile for the customer feedback they have been getting .
personalized service one of their regular customers that they 've gotten through twitter , is tina mammoser , an american artist who lives in london .
" i blogged about them because i love them ! " she said .
she added that she does n't drive and has always had problems finding transport services willing and able to take large canvases to art galleries " the first time i used them , i was tweeting back and forth , asking them to measure the inside of the cab because i needed to get a 1.2-meter by 1.5-meter painting inside , " she said . " and then i got a twitter message later from one of the drivers who had gone out and measured the distance between the sides of the cab . "
cox noted that this kind of personal service can build relationships in a way that a traditional , anonymous taxi stand or automated phone line ca n't .
" -lsb- customers -rsb- like to know that they 're having a conversation with a group of people rather than a machine , it 's not just an automated response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : @ tweetalondoncab organizers have invited programmers and social media experts to a " cab camp " on october 1 an upcoming " cab camp " as the number of tweet requests grows , the cab drivers are looking for more efficient technological ways of streamlining the booking system .
that 's why they have organized a " cab camp " in london on october 1 , to which they 've invited a number of social media and it professionals .
lee cox and his colleagues hope to learn more about existing potential technological solutions to simplify their work and improve the service .
" there 's such a lot of information revolving around the geo-location that you get from your phone now , " he said . " so we physically know where the cab driver and the customer -lsb- are -rsb- , so just the ability to link those two together would itself make it much more productive . "

they are organizing a ' cab camp ' to further the technology next month . london 's black cab drivers are famous for having to learn " the knowledge , " which is essentially memorizing and being able to navigate all of the city 's streets .
however , over the last several months , a small subset of this closely-knit tribe has started to add another tool - twitter - as a way to make it easier for drivers and customers to find each other .
for now , organizers say , @ tweetalondoncab is the only tweetable cab service in the united kingdom , and possibly even the world .
" we got quite a few requests asking us if we 'd take ' tweet ' bookings , " said lee cox , one of the organizers .
" two of the guys decided to give it a go and that 's how @ tweetalondoncab was born . "
setting the wheels in motion it all began in early 2010 as just another online social network community : a twitter group for london taxi drivers to chat and share information about work opportunities and hotspots , traffic and road-works , bargain car part stores and coffee-break meet-ups . but the account soon attracted followers who were cab users rather than cab drivers .
there are now 115 members of the collective , which is managed entirely by the drivers .
so far , they have over 8,000 followers and 100 regular clients - that 's still an extreme minority of the 25,000 licensed black cabs in the english capital .
at the moment , cox says that only about five percent of his business comes in through twitter , but he adds , it 's growing at a rapid pace .
for the hundreds of people who use the service , the booking system works by prospective customers following @ tweetalondoncab 's twitter account , which then follows them back .
after that , they can send a direct message with details of their request .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers follow @ tweetalondoncab and then can communicate with the drivers privately via " direct message " " we use direct message because it 's more secure and ensures privacy , " lee cox told deutsche welle .
" nothing is passed on the open twitter streams that people can see so no-one knows where you 're going to and from . "
the drivers are n't sending the tweets directly from the cabs .
the cabbies in this group take turns doing online shifts at home , reading incoming messages and then passing on the relevant ones to the drivers .
lee cox himself does five two-hour stints a week at home in front of his computer but says the investment of personal time is well worthwhile for the customer feedback they have been getting .
personalized service one of their regular customers that they 've gotten through twitter , is tina mammoser , an american artist who lives in london .
" i blogged about them because i love them ! " she said .
she added that she does n't drive and has always had problems finding transport services willing and able to take large canvases to art galleries " the first time i used them , i was tweeting back and forth , asking them to measure the inside of the cab because i needed to get a 1.2-meter by 1.5-meter painting inside , " she said . " and then i got a twitter message later from one of the drivers who had gone out and measured the distance between the sides of the cab . "
cox noted that this kind of personal service can build relationships in a way that a traditional , anonymous taxi stand or automated phone line ca n't .
" -lsb- customers -rsb- like to know that they 're having a conversation with a group of people rather than a machine , it 's not just an automated response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : @ tweetalondoncab organizers have invited programmers and social media experts to a " cab camp " on october 1 an upcoming " cab camp " as the number of tweet requests grows , the cab drivers are looking for more efficient technological ways of streamlining the booking system .
that 's why they have organized a " cab camp " in london on october 1 , to which they 've invited a number of social media and it professionals .
lee cox and his colleagues hope to learn more about existing potential technological solutions to simplify their work and improve the service .
" there 's such a lot of information revolving around the geo-location that you get from your phone now , " he said . " so we physically know where the cab driver and the customer -lsb- are -rsb- , so just the ability to link those two together would itself make it much more productive . "

a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .
government scientists are expected to announce the results of their tests soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 14.09.2010 agronomists suspect gm seeds behind nepal crop failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corn has become a major staple in nepal , so crop failures are a painful blow the cause of nepal 's recent corn crop failure remains a major mystery .
a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .
government scientists are expected to announce the results of their tests soon .
but without seed samples , agronomists may never know the full story . author : reese erlich -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man said nothing when asked to explain the incident .
it remains unclear how he will plead or whether he will even testify during the proceedings , which are to resume on october 1 .

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

dw-world.de german-turkish politician calls for burqa ban liberal german-turkish politician serkan toeren has called for a ban on the full-body veil worn by muslim women .
toeren wants to follow in the model set by france and belgium , which banned the burqa earlier this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .

" the european commission has strongly criticized the french government for its decision to deport hundreds of roma migrants in recent weeks .
justice commissioner viviane reding said she was appalled by the expulsions and described the policy as a " disgrace . "
" it is shocking that a part of the -lrb- french -rrb- government comes here and says something and another part of the government does the opposite , " she said .
" my patience is wearing thin : enough is enough ! " she added , thumping the podium in the european commission 's press room .

those who did not take up the government offer were to be deported .

the initial infringement proceedings could eventually lead to the case being heard before the eu court of justice in luxembourg , which has the power to impose fines .
support in germany the commissioner was joined in her attack by the leaders of the roma and sinti community in germany , who criticized french president nicolas sarkozy over the deportation policies , which they said encouraged far-right attitudes .

thomas koehler is the first top official from the gdr to acknowledge the existence of such a program .
koehler , a former vice-president of the east german umbrella sports organization , the dtsb , makes the revelations in a book to be published this week , in which he writes that officials gave performance-enhancing substances to elite athletes from the early 1970s onwards .
he says the decision was taken because other countries were also doping their top athletes .
he alleges that substance abuse in countries like the united states and the german federal republic -lrb- west germany -rrb- prompted the use of " selected anabolic substances in several sports " in the east .
" if east germany wanted to remain competitive it had no choice but to allow the use of doping substances , " koehler says in the book entitled two sides of the medal .
doping of juniors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach has welcomed the admissions of doping koehler says doping was a part of " supporting methods " and only used for top adult athletes under strict supervision from officials and doctors .
he also reveals that , in some cases , underage athletes were doped because in some sports , such as swimming , there is a lower average age at which athletes reach their peak .
" if athletes were involved from the age of 16 onwards , this took place with full consideration of their biological maturity and with their sports physicians bearing special responsibility , " he says .
koehler claims " there were no severe health problems or deaths in the gdr , as in other countries " because a large number of doctors were involved in the doping process .
" all substances were given to the athletes with their consent .
i know of no case in which a coach or an athlete was advised from above to use doping substances .
it is untrue that athletes who rejected forbidden substances lost their place on the squad , " he writes .
koehler , 70 , is a two-time olympic luge champion who later became national luge team coach .
he was a member of east germany 's olympic committee and held a number of top sport positions in the gdr , including the vice-presidency of the dtsb from 1981 until german reunification in 1990 .
mixed response to book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niemann-stirnemann is adamant that some athletes were doped unawares thomas bach , the head of the german olympic sports association , welcomed the comments on tuesday , saying they brought " more clarity into the reappraisal of the doping history " of the former gdr .
bach said the doping of top athletes in east germany was well-known , " but those responsible for sport policy in the former gdr have always largely denied it . "
however , former east german sprinter and doping victim ines geipel said koehler 's book was " completely irresponsible " and contained " absolutely nothing new . " koehler was just trying to discredit the victims , she said .
three-time olympic speed-skating champion gunda niemann-stirnemann said : " if -lrb- koehler -rrb- thinks all athletes knew about the substances they received , then that 's his opinion . "

thomas koehler is the first top official from the gdr to acknowledge the existence of such a program .
koehler , a former vice-president of the east german umbrella sports organization , the dtsb , makes the revelations in a book to be published this week , in which he writes that officials gave performance-enhancing substances to elite athletes from the early 1970s onwards .
he says the decision was taken because other countries were also doping their top athletes .
he alleges that substance abuse in countries like the united states and the german federal republic -lrb- west germany -rrb- prompted the use of " selected anabolic substances in several sports " in the east .
" if east germany wanted to remain competitive it had no choice but to allow the use of doping substances , " koehler says in the book entitled two sides of the medal .
doping of juniors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach has welcomed the admissions of doping koehler says doping was a part of " supporting methods " and only used for top adult athletes under strict supervision from officials and doctors .
he also reveals that , in some cases , underage athletes were doped because in some sports , such as swimming , there is a lower average age at which athletes reach their peak .
" if athletes were involved from the age of 16 onwards , this took place with full consideration of their biological maturity and with their sports physicians bearing special responsibility , " he says .
koehler claims " there were no severe health problems or deaths in the gdr , as in other countries " because a large number of doctors were involved in the doping process .
" all substances were given to the athletes with their consent .
i know of no case in which a coach or an athlete was advised from above to use doping substances .
it is untrue that athletes who rejected forbidden substances lost their place on the squad , " he writes .
koehler , 70 , is a two-time olympic luge champion who later became national luge team coach .
he was a member of east germany 's olympic committee and held a number of top sport positions in the gdr , including the vice-presidency of the dtsb from 1981 until german reunification in 1990 .
mixed response to book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niemann-stirnemann is adamant that some athletes were doped unawares thomas bach , the head of the german olympic sports association , welcomed the comments on tuesday , saying they brought " more clarity into the reappraisal of the doping history " of the former gdr .

cdu leaders deny their party needs a clearer identity . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- defended itself against rumblings that the party is losing its identity , as the cdu 's unity came under fire from its disgruntled ultra-conservatives .
many conservative traditionalists do not feel at home in the party anymore , according to martin lohmann , spokesman for the cdu 's platform for active catholics .
lohmann told deutsche welle that " conservative core values are no longer being upheld by the leadership , leaving more and more party members politically homeless . "
" there 's a real threat of a breakaway conservative party emerging as our leaders appear to be sleeping through recent developments , " he added .
a new party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcallister said the cdu would remain home to germany 's conservatives such arguments have picked up steam since right-wing figurehead erika steinbach announced last week her resignation .
steinbach was steeped in controversy after statements she made implying poland was partly to blame for world war ii .
steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii .
she told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag that she believed there was room on the german political stage for an ultraconservative party right of the cdu .
polling firm emnid confirmed steinbach 's statement with a study released monday , in which the firm found that a new right-wing party could win nearly 20 percent of german votes .
most of these 20 percent were disenfranchised voters from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , emnid director klaus-peter schoeppner told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
schoeppner added that the two conservative parties had lost a third of their loyal members since the last parliamentary elections in september 2009 .
cdu shedding leaders yet the cdu seems to be having as much difficulty maintaining its own politicians as its voters .
gero neugebauer , a political analyst at berlin 's free university , believes the debate is purely political and has little to do with conservative identity but is rather being " brought up as an alibi by politicians who must realize their position in the party is getting weaker and who feel they need to say goodbye in a loud way . "
merkel 's tight grip on her party has left scores of arch-conservatives by the wayside .
among those who became disillusioned and left party posts were conservative heavyweights friedrich merz and former hesse state premier roland koch - as well as christian wulff , the current german president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultra-conservative steinbach 's resignation cast the spotlight on the cdu 's unhappy right wing although merkel threw her support behind wulff to replace the also-resigned president horst koehler , that move was widely seen as a bid to eliminate him as a potential rival for the chancellorship .
cdu based on ' three pillars ' stanislaw tillich , leader of the cdu in the eastern state of saxony , stressed that the resignation of some cdu politicians did not signify the party had lost its identity .
tillich dismissed the need for a debate over the cdu 's identity altogether , claiming that the formula for a so-called " catch-all " party was " that it has members from all wings -lsb- of the political spectrum -rsb- . "
lower saxony state premier david mcallister meanwhile stressed on monday that the cdu , best known for its fiscal conservatism , had three major streams : " conservatives , those concerned with social issues and liberals . "
he stressed that the cdu was germany 's only big-tent party , saying that conservatives had found their home within the cdu and would continue to do so .
merkel also clung to the cdu 's so-called three pillars .
" none of these roots will ever be neglected because they make up our political strength , " she said .
" there 's no room for a party to the right of the cdu and it 's our task to stop any radical views from gaining ground . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one pollster estimates merkel 's party has lost a third of voters erika steinbach , who despite advocating a new right-wing protest party , says she intends to remain in the cdu , also repeated the party line , with her own twist .

but the findings also imply a growing gap between the social classes . fifty-nine percent of german youth said they were optimistic about their own future , compared with 50 percent in 2006 when the last shell youth study was conducted .
thirty-three percent said they were undecided and seven percent said their future was poor .
the first such study took place in 1953 and since then has been regularly updated at three or four year intervals . the researchers based their findings on surveys and in-depth interviews with more than 2,500 germans aged between 12 and 25 .
respondents were broken down by age sub-groups , gender and socioeconomic status .
the current generation of youth faces greater uncertainty surrounding economic success and the value of a university degree , said dr. matthias albert , a professor of political science at bielefeld university who was involved in compiling the study .
yet despite that uncertainty and " the mounting pressure on young people in society , they have not only retained their optimism , but it has increased significantly . "
family orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a university degree is less of an assurance of economic success than previously thought the seemingly paradoxical increase in optimism is based on a mix of traditional , more conservative values and modern , progressive values that are more self-centered .
" they have put a stronger emphasis on closer social ties , " albert said .
" they value family to an extraordinary degree .
and this gives them the foundation , so to speak , and the confidence from which they can try to face the challenges before them . "
but while the overall optimism of youth has risen , the study also found that the difference between the outlook of privileged and underprivileged youths is widening .
a third of youths from socially disadvantaged families say their future looks positive - lower than in 2006 - and 40 percent say they are satisfied with their lives .
middle- and upper-class youth are almost twice as likely to express that same satisfaction .
" despite specific measures being taken , we see no evidence whatsoever that this rift is somehow closing , " albert said .
" and that 's the biggest concern , that despite belonging to a generation which is doing rather well , we are somehow losing a small but significant part of it . "
political engagement youth 's interest in politics has increased slightly - 37 percent from 35 percent in 2006 - but it remains much lower than levels in the 1970s and 80s .
however when filtered for age group , political interest declined among youths aged 18 and older and increased significantly for the younger generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet access among young people has become nearly universal in the past eight years , the percentage of 12 to 14 year-olds who express interest in politics has nearly doubled to 21 percent , while the the figure for 15- to 17-year-olds rose from 20 to 33 percent .
beyond that , younger germans are also more likely to say they would engage in political activities like signature campaigns or demonstrations , which albert said is one of the most significant findings of the study .
" the increased political interest among the young , together with their willingness to become politically active suggest to us that we are witnessing the beginning of a new political generation , " he said .

cdu leaders deny their party needs a clearer identity . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- defended itself against rumblings that the party is losing its identity , as the cdu 's unity came under fire from its disgruntled ultra-conservatives .
many conservative traditionalists do not feel at home in the party anymore , according to martin lohmann , spokesman for the cdu 's platform for active catholics .
lohmann told deutsche welle that " conservative core values are no longer being upheld by the leadership , leaving more and more party members politically homeless . "
" there 's a real threat of a breakaway conservative party emerging as our leaders appear to be sleeping through recent developments , " he added .
a new party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcallister said the cdu would remain home to germany 's conservatives such arguments have picked up steam since right-wing figurehead erika steinbach announced last week her resignation .
steinbach was steeped in controversy after statements she made implying poland was partly to blame for world war ii .
steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii .
she told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag that she believed there was room on the german political stage for an ultraconservative party right of the cdu .
polling firm emnid confirmed steinbach 's statement with a study released monday , in which the firm found that a new right-wing party could win nearly 20 percent of german votes .
most of these 20 percent were disenfranchised voters from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , emnid director klaus-peter schoeppner told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
schoeppner added that the two conservative parties had lost a third of their loyal members since the last parliamentary elections in september 2009 .
cdu shedding leaders yet the cdu seems to be having as much difficulty maintaining its own politicians as its voters .
gero neugebauer , a political analyst at berlin 's free university , believes the debate is purely political and has little to do with conservative identity but is rather being " brought up as an alibi by politicians who must realize their position in the party is getting weaker and who feel they need to say goodbye in a loud way . "
merkel 's tight grip on her party has left scores of arch-conservatives by the wayside .
among those who became disillusioned and left party posts were conservative heavyweights friedrich merz and former hesse state premier roland koch - as well as christian wulff , the current german president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultra-conservative steinbach 's resignation cast the spotlight on the cdu 's unhappy right wing although merkel threw her support behind wulff to replace the also-resigned president horst koehler , that move was widely seen as a bid to eliminate him as a potential rival for the chancellorship .
cdu based on ' three pillars ' stanislaw tillich , leader of the cdu in the eastern state of saxony , stressed that the resignation of some cdu politicians did not signify the party had lost its identity .
tillich dismissed the need for a debate over the cdu 's identity altogether , claiming that the formula for a so-called " catch-all " party was " that it has members from all wings -lsb- of the political spectrum -rsb- . "
lower saxony state premier david mcallister meanwhile stressed on monday that the cdu , best known for its fiscal conservatism , had three major streams : " conservatives , those concerned with social issues and liberals . "
he stressed that the cdu was germany 's only big-tent party , saying that conservatives had found their home within the cdu and would continue to do so .
merkel also clung to the cdu 's so-called three pillars .
" none of these roots will ever be neglected because they make up our political strength , " she said .
" there 's no room for a party to the right of the cdu and it 's our task to stop any radical views from gaining ground . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one pollster estimates merkel 's party has lost a third of voters erika steinbach , who despite advocating a new right-wing protest party , says she intends to remain in the cdu , also repeated the party line , with her own twist .

among those who became disillusioned and left party posts were conservative heavyweights friedrich merz and former hesse state premier roland koch - as well as christian wulff , the current german president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultra-conservative steinbach 's resignation cast the spotlight on the cdu 's unhappy right wing although merkel threw her support behind wulff to replace the also-resigned president horst koehler , that move was widely seen as a bid to eliminate him as a potential rival for the chancellorship .
cdu based on ' three pillars ' stanislaw tillich , leader of the cdu in the eastern state of saxony , stressed that the resignation of some cdu politicians did not signify the party had lost its identity .
tillich dismissed the need for a debate over the cdu 's identity altogether , claiming that the formula for a so-called " catch-all " party was " that it has members from all wings -lsb- of the political spectrum -rsb- . "
lower saxony state premier david mcallister meanwhile stressed on monday that the cdu , best known for its fiscal conservatism , had three major streams : " conservatives , those concerned with social issues and liberals . "
he stressed that the cdu was germany 's only big-tent party , saying that conservatives had found their home within the cdu and would continue to do so .
merkel also clung to the cdu 's so-called three pillars .
" none of these roots will ever be neglected because they make up our political strength , " she said .
" there 's no room for a party to the right of the cdu and it 's our task to stop any radical views from gaining ground . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one pollster estimates merkel 's party has lost a third of voters erika steinbach , who despite advocating a new right-wing protest party , says she intends to remain in the cdu , also repeated the party line , with her own twist .
" we have three legs – a table with three legs , " steinbach said , in what has been interpreted as a sideswipe against the party in which she no longer feels at home .

but the findings also imply a growing gap between the social classes . fifty-nine percent of german youth said they were optimistic about their own future , compared with 50 percent in 2006 when the last shell youth study was conducted .
thirty-three percent said they were undecided and seven percent said their future was poor .
the first such study took place in 1953 and since then has been regularly updated at three or four year intervals . the researchers based their findings on surveys and in-depth interviews with more than 2,500 germans aged between 12 and 25 .
respondents were broken down by age sub-groups , gender and socioeconomic status .
the current generation of youth faces greater uncertainty surrounding economic success and the value of a university degree , said dr. matthias albert , a professor of political science at bielefeld university who was involved in compiling the study .
yet despite that uncertainty and " the mounting pressure on young people in society , they have not only retained their optimism , but it has increased significantly . "
family orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a university degree is less of an assurance of economic success than previously thought the seemingly paradoxical increase in optimism is based on a mix of traditional , more conservative values and modern , progressive values that are more self-centered .
" they have put a stronger emphasis on closer social ties , " albert said .
" they value family to an extraordinary degree .
and this gives them the foundation , so to speak , and the confidence from which they can try to face the challenges before them . "
but while the overall optimism of youth has risen , the study also found that the difference between the outlook of privileged and underprivileged youths is widening .
a third of youths from socially disadvantaged families say their future looks positive - lower than in 2006 - and 40 percent say they are satisfied with their lives .
middle- and upper-class youth are almost twice as likely to express that same satisfaction .
" despite specific measures being taken , we see no evidence whatsoever that this rift is somehow closing , " albert said .
" and that 's the biggest concern , that despite belonging to a generation which is doing rather well , we are somehow losing a small but significant part of it . "
political engagement youth 's interest in politics has increased slightly - 37 percent from 35 percent in 2006 - but it remains much lower than levels in the 1970s and 80s .
however when filtered for age group , political interest declined among youths aged 18 and older and increased significantly for the younger generation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet access among young people has become nearly universal in the past eight years , the percentage of 12 to 14 year-olds who express interest in politics has nearly doubled to 21 percent , while the the figure for 15- to 17-year-olds rose from 20 to 33 percent .
beyond that , younger germans are also more likely to say they would engage in political activities like signature campaigns or demonstrations , which albert said is one of the most significant findings of the study .
" the increased political interest among the young , together with their willingness to become politically active suggest to us that we are witnessing the beginning of a new political generation , " he said .

the finance ministry is looking to reduce spending drastically but there is opposition as to where those reductions are being made . the bundestag , germany 's lower house , convened this tuesday to begin discussing the budget for 2011 .
according to the finance ministry , spending cuts adding up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- are planned .
germany , like many other countries around europe still dealing with the effects of the financial crisis , is faced with the need to make massive spending cuts to balance its budget .
in june the federal government in berlin proposed an unprecedented package of austerity measures that aim to reduce government spending by 80 billion euros over the next four years .
distribution of austerity the spending cuts have been extensively debated since being proposed .
the criticism , however , is not focused on the amount of the cuts or whether they are necessary , as consensus was reached in june regarding the need to balance the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poss objects to the ' unbalanced ' distribution with that being said , opposition politicians have severely criticized where the planned spending cuts are being made , which will make for continued debate over the next four days among parliamentarians in berlin .
the current head of the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction , joachim poss , said on tuesday ahead of the budget debate the proposed cuts were " socially unbalanced . "
he added : " this is a budget proposal that will further divide our country .
-lsb- the center-right government -rsb- is dividing our country . "
the social democrats argue that social areas are bearing the brunt of the spending cuts , for instance unemployment and child benefits , and that the wealthy are being spared .
from 2010 to 2011 , spending for social benefits will decrease from 54 to 50 percent of the total federal budget . the labor ministry is facing the largest cuts ; it will have 10 percent less funds at its disposal in 2011 compared to this year .
motivation for spending cuts the head of the governing free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- parliamentary faction , birgit homburger , responded to criticism on monday by applauding the government 's desire to rein in the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says spending cuts are hard but necessary she said that the children of germany 's future generations " will not be able to play on mountains of debt , " adding that this was " our motivation for the spending cuts . "
the fdp 's budget expert , otto fricke , echoed homburger 's praise of the government 's austerity package ; however , he added that changes were possible with regard to the distribution of the cuts .
" we will consider any suggestions for improvement of the proposal , insofar as these are concrete alternatives , " fricke said in berlin .
tuesday 's federal budget debate will be followed by discussions of the individual ministerial budgets .
the bundestag is scheduled to pass the overall 2011 budget in late november .

he added : " this is a budget proposal that will further divide our country .
-lsb- the center-right government -rsb- is dividing our country . "
the social democrats argue that social areas are bearing the brunt of the spending cuts , for instance unemployment and child benefits , and that the wealthy are being spared .
from 2010 to 2011 , spending for social benefits will decrease from 54 to 50 percent of the total federal budget . the labor ministry is facing the largest cuts ; it will have 10 percent less funds at its disposal in 2011 compared to this year .
motivation for spending cuts the head of the governing free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- parliamentary faction , birgit homburger , responded to criticism on monday by applauding the government 's desire to rein in the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says spending cuts are hard but necessary she said that the children of germany 's future generations " will not be able to play on mountains of debt , " adding that this was " our motivation for the spending cuts . "

" we will consider any suggestions for improvement of the proposal , insofar as these are concrete alternatives , " fricke said in berlin .
tuesday 's federal budget debate will be followed by discussions of the individual ministerial budgets .
the bundestag is scheduled to pass the overall 2011 budget in late november .

leading government officials have signalled their approval of the reform plans . the executive committee of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- appears prepared to support defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg 's plans to reform the german army , the bundeswehr .
the proposals could see the bundeswehr turned into a volunteer army , after 50 years of conscription .
under the defense minister 's proposals , germany would suspend conscription , but retain it in the constitution .
the army would then only accept some 7,500 volunteers for between 12 to 23 months .
young men would retain the status of conscripts , but they would not be drafted .
guttenberg said that despite the plans , the cdu would remain the " party of the bundeswehr and of security , " adding that the move was not a shift away from the party ’ s traditional , conservative values .
cdu secretary general hermann groehe said the party 's executive committee had not taken a decision yet , but had shown a " great openness " for guttenberg 's plans .
the chancellor 's coalition partner in the government , the free democrats , welcomed the cdu committee 's decision at a meeting late on monday .
a revolutionary reform previously opposed to the minister 's reform plans , the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , has also signalled its agreement .
a difference of opinion remains , however , as csu leader horst seehofer demands that conscription should be completely abolished , not just discontinued . in addition , guttenberg wants to slash troop levels from about 245,000 today to about 164,000 troops in the future .
the result would be what he has termed a " smaller but better army , more effectively equipped for operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could be history in less than a year the armed forces are controlled by parliament the reform is needed to meet savings the government wants to impose on the military over the next four years .
guttenberg made a renewed appeal for his reform plans in the würzburger tagespost newspaper monday edition .
conscription has a grand tradition , he said .
" but it has shriveled and is now only a shadow of its former self . "
twenty years ago , west germans served 18 months in the army or in social services if they were conscientious objectors .
today , the length of military service has dropped to six months and only about 16 percent of those of military age actually serve .
should party members at the cdu and csu annual conventions later this year go along with the proposals , conscription in the german bundeswehr could be discontinued as early as july 2011 .

young men would retain the status of conscripts , but they would not be drafted .
guttenberg said that despite the plans , the cdu would remain the " party of the bundeswehr and of security , " adding that the move was not a shift away from the party ’ s traditional , conservative values .
cdu secretary general hermann groehe said the party 's executive committee had not taken a decision yet , but had shown a " great openness " for guttenberg 's plans .
the chancellor 's coalition partner in the government , the free democrats , welcomed the cdu committee 's decision at a meeting late on monday .
a revolutionary reform previously opposed to the minister 's reform plans , the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , has also signalled its agreement .
a difference of opinion remains , however , as csu leader horst seehofer demands that conscription should be completely abolished , not just discontinued . in addition , guttenberg wants to slash troop levels from about 245,000 today to about 164,000 troops in the future .
the result would be what he has termed a " smaller but better army , more effectively equipped for operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could be history in less than a year the armed forces are controlled by parliament the reform is needed to meet savings the government wants to impose on the military over the next four years .
guttenberg made a renewed appeal for his reform plans in the würzburger tagespost newspaper monday edition .
conscription has a grand tradition , he said .
" but it has shriveled and is now only a shadow of its former self . "
twenty years ago , west germans served 18 months in the army or in social services if they were conscientious objectors .
today , the length of military service has dropped to six months and only about 16 percent of those of military age actually serve .
should party members at the cdu and csu annual conventions later this year go along with the proposals , conscription in the german bundeswehr could be discontinued as early as july 2011 .

leading government officials have signalled their approval of the reform plans . the executive committee of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- appears prepared to support defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg 's plans to reform the german army , the bundeswehr .
the proposals could see the bundeswehr turned into a volunteer army , after 50 years of conscription .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .
ma at least is convinced .

but in china , grassroots movements are developing anti-poverty strategies that contradict the country ’ s authoritarian system . while regions such as sub-saharan africa have seen an increase in people who live on a dollar per day , china 's communist government has managed to free 600 million of its over one billion citizens from absolute poverty in the past 25 years .
but a lasting improvement of living conditions can only be achieved if people themselves have a part in the decision-making process .
at the grassroots level , some chinese have taken the initiative in this direction .
they have begun to ask how citizens can continue to improve their living conditions independent of government money . wang wei , from a small village in sichuan province , is one of them .
he founded a private institute aimed at developing local communities .
but the chinese government views the underlying concept of his organization with suspicion : helping people learn to help themselves . wang believes that personal initiative and participation are the keys to improving living standards in his country .
the means to achieve this end are small loans for co-operatives in rural communities . " the combination of loans and later repayment supports economic activity , " wang said .
" that way , you support the community 's ability to develop itself . " public skepticism the chinese government keeps close tabs on wang and his co-workers .
the ideas of personal initiative and participation contradict the model of an omnipresent , patronizing state which has characterized china 's political system since the communist party took power in 1949 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many farmers are reluctant to take their own initiative wang knows the government watches his institute with suspicion .
he used to work for the state in sichuan province with the anti-poverty office , but decided to quit after his ideas fell on deaf ears . it is not just the chinese government that has reservations , though .
the farmers themselves , the very people that wang 's institute seeks to help , are cautious .
during a discussion in a neighboring mountain village with local farmers , wang 's ideas of small loans and co-operatives are met largely with silence . many farmers remember the era of forced collectivization during the mao years , and are suspicious of any collective .
some personally suffered during the famine that ensued in the 1960s . unhelpful assistance local farmers like ma qian speak freely about the problems .
he is angered by the state aid that came after the devastating earthquake which shook the region in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sichuan province , new homes are replacing the destroyed wooden houses the village was largely destroyed , so the authorities built new apartment buildings - without asking the farmers for their input .
the homes are now an hour-and-a-half walk away from the farmers ' fields .
the new apartments do have electricity and running water , but the farmers had to borrow money to afford their new accommodations and are now in debt .
their livestock is too far away .
and the electricity prices are much too high . according to ma , identifying the problems is not an issue .
taking the initiative to solve them is the challenge .
but they have to correspond to the farmers ' needs . " we have to set the exact conditions for the co-operative , " says ma .
" you have to define the goal and set it in relation to the achievable income .
if the goal is too high and the income too low , you wo n't find anyone for it . " wang assures the farmers once again that the co-operative he is suggesting will be self-determined .
ma at least is convinced .
whether the government and the other farmers will come around remains an open question . note : all names in this article have been changed to protect those involved . author : kristin kupfer -lrb- sk -rrb- editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is one of the most knowledge-intensive and innovative countries on earth .
in this study we focus on the innovative performance of its sixteen federal states with reference to eight indicators .
the most innovative states lie in the south , while the east trails in terms of absolute levels .
however , interdisciplinarity and regional industrial diversity cushion negative effects of structural change on the regions and offer alternative sources of sustained economic growth .
looking at the dynamic of innovation it is apparent that the states in the east of germany spearheaded by saxony are on the right course . german residential property : back in fashion with good reason ?
the low number of completions , germany 's quick economic recovery , low interest rates and the fact that many investors are looking for low-risk investment products have led to a small boom in some subsegments of the residential property market .
prices are on the rise for prime inner-city locations especially in the major conurbations .
bargains can also be found in numerous attractive medium-sized towns and cities such as well-established university towns .
on average , house prices in germany look set to rise by roughly 1.5 % p.a. over the next two years .
the positive outlook should not , however , render investors blind to the specific investment risks : real estate is always an investment in a particular region or area , making it vulnerable to changes in regional economic structures and the related demographic changes . germany : only modest decline in the current account surplus the german export momentum is currently benefiting from extremely dynamic world trade .
however , it is likely to ease significantly in h2 2010 and above all in 2011 .
in addition to the impact of this cyclical development the highly export-dependent german economy is also being hit by the adjustments in europe ’ s crisis-ridden countries , even though the strain on the german current account is likely to remain within bounds .
nevertheless , in the medium term germany ’ s large current account surplus needs to be reduced , as the origins of the crisis lay in undesirable structural developments on both sides , that is not only in current account deficits , but also in the reciprocal surpluses .
all in all , we expect that the german current account surplus will first widen from 5.0 % to 5 ½ % of gdp this year , before narrowing slowly , however .
in 2012 it could then stand at 4 ½ % . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many of the nation 's citizens believe public corruption has undermined the effectiveness of the government 's anti-poverty programs . the millennium development campaign reports that poverty in the developing world has dropped by 19 percent during the past 20 years , putting it on track to halve poverty by 2015 . yet there are nations in the world - the un calls them " least developed countries " -lrb- ldcs -rrb- - that have not experienced the rapid reduction in the number of poor seen , for example , in china .
uganda is one of these ldcs .
as a landlocked nation , its development prospects already face major challenges .
but according to some ugandans , there is also a human problem that is preventing significant reductions in poverty : public corruption .
ineffective programs caroline nambooze has not seen much in the way of government help .
she breaks rocks for a living in a stone quarry located outside of uganda 's capital kampala .
it provides construction material for the country 's blossoming construction industry .
two of nambooze 's children died of malaria .
she can barely send her surviving daughter to school with the $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- she earns a month .
" i buy a piece of rock , and i break it into little pieces , " nambooze said .
" that helps me earn money for housing , groceries and the school fees for my only living child . "
the ugandan government , led by president yoweri museveni , has implemented programs like the national agricultural advisory service -lrb- naads -rrb- to help people - especially farmers - in desperate financial situations like nambooze .
the program should facilitate the acquisition of new livestock and better feed by farmers .
but naads faces hurdles that prevent the rural poor from receiving the help they seek .
" i do n't go to naads because i do n't have enough money , " said jane rose kasukari , a farmer and widowed mother of eight children .
" i was told that i had to pay cash to register , and i could profit from the program later . "

it planned to raise the living standards of ugandans by providing them with cheap credit distributed through local cooperatives .
but like naads , its implementation has been problematic .
" the progress report of the un millennium development goals showed a mixed picture of the condition of the programs in uganda , " deo nyanzi , manager of the uganda national ngo forum , told deutsche welle .
" the widespread corruption at high levels is responsible for the failure of president yoweri museveni 's policies . "
ugandans losing faith in government because these public programs have not delivered , many ugandans are losing faith in their government and hope in the future .

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .

a government investigation is focusing on the possibilities of bad gm seeds or extreme weather , but it is struggling to find proof . in late 2009 and early this year nepal suffered a massive corn crop failure .
thousands of peasants were ruined financially , and they blocked roads and blockaded government buildings in protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra kunwar is trying to get to the bottom of the crop failure according to one peasant farmer , who tends goats and raises subsistence crops – including corn – in southern nepal , last year 's crop failure devastated farmers in her region .
" i heard all of the corn grew , but none of the cobs had kernels in them , " she said . some farmers blame multinational companies who sold the seed .
a government investigation is examining that theory , but it has also focused on another potential culprit : extreme weather . chitra kunwar , a government agronomist , has been examining test corn to determine what caused the seeds to go bad . " these are the problem varieties , right here in these three rows , " he said , pointing to corn that has grown four meters tall . indian and us manufacturers said unusually cold weather was to blame for the crop 's failure , but south african farmers reported a similar incident two years ago with monsanto 's genetically modified corn .
wanted : seed samples but kunwar faces additional obstacles : he has been unable to conduct his tests properly without the original samples , and the local suppliers – called agrovets – aren ’ t providing them .
" when we asked the agrovets for the seeds , the agrovets told us that they didn ’ t have any more , " he said . " but they would ask the multinational companies that sold them the seeds for more seeds .
and if they got more seeds , they would give them to us . "
even asking the multinational companies to produce samples of the seeds is complicated , which meant kunwar did not have access to every type of corn that was sold .
" we don ’ t exactly know because the multinational companies have agents we have to talk to , like a middleman , " he said .
seeds from three indian companies , as well as american manufacturers dupont and monsanto , have been found in nepal .
contacted at their us headquarters , a monsanto spokesperson said the crop failure was caused by unusually cold weather , not by any problems with the seeds .
but nirval gadal , a nepali agronomist working at an international agricultural ngo , said smuggling seeds by middlemen is a huge problem .
" according to the seed act , these seeds must be registered with the national seed board and before the farmers do planting , it should be tested by the laboratory , " gadal said .
" and the public organizations should keep that seed lot as a sample so that if there are problems , we can test it later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsistence farmers in southern nepal are highly dependent upon their harvests a weak regulatory framework foreign companies know that farming regulations are not well enforced in nepal , and gadal said it poses a major challenge there : " they come directly to the farmers , the staff of the multinational companies .
they do demonstrations for them .
they give training to them .
they sell the seed without giving information to government offices . "
four years ago , nepalis overthrew a dictatorial government , but forming a new and effective administration has been difficult .
" our regulatory mechanism is very weak , " gadal said , noting an open border with india that allows easy entry .
" by taking advantage of this weak regulatory system , they can come directly to the farmers to sell the seeds , " gadal added .
scientists working at an agricultural testing station have been trying to duplicate last season ’ s conditions .
they know that peasants planted foreign hybrid seeds , but they do not know whether they were genetically modified organisms , known as gmos , or conventional hybrids .
dilip paudel , who has been working at the testing station , said all foreign hybrid seeds are unsuitable for nepal because they have not been bred for local conditions .
" here at the national maize research program … we have good varieties of maize that have been tested here , " paudel said .
" they ’ re open pollinated varieties , not hybrids . "
paudel said those types have proved successful in nepal , " whereas gmos can be dangerous because they ’ re brought from the outside and they ’ re a risk . "
waiting for test results in kathmandu , agronomist gadal thinks the massive corn crop failure is likely due to a mixture of bad hybrid seeds and extreme weather , but without proof , he ca n't be sure .
" if we see the climate conditions that happened between october and february , 2009 to 2010 , the temperature has gone down , " gadal said .
" this is very true – it is beyond this problem , beyond climate change , because we saw there were other deformities in the maize crops . " gadal said those deformities were likely caused by sterile or otherwise altered seeds .
government scientists are expected to announce the results of their tests soon .
but without seed samples , agronomists may never know the full story . author : reese erlich -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as addressing development issues during the september 20-22 summit , merkel and westerwelle will also use the new york trip to once again push for germany 's consideration as a rotating permanent member of the united nations security council as part of their wider plan for un reform .
in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany would be wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

nonetheless , the spectacularly useful bamboo plant has yet to be taken seriously as a building material in the industrialized world . for centuries , mankind has been using bamboo , one of the most versatile and sustainable building materials available . " not only is bamboo light and flexible , it 's also exceptionally stable , " 43-year-old colombian architect francisco gallo said . gallo hails from pereira , a region of colombia known for its traditional bamboo farmhouses . he trained in spain to be an " environment administrator , " writing his dissertation on the development of engineered bamboo for use in construction materials for sustainable buildings and setting up a project called " bambhaus . " in 2009 , the initiative garnered him first prize in the renowned altran foundation for innovation competition . sustainable building as gallo explains , bamboo is superior to conventional timber in many ways .
it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .
it therefore takes only three years for a bamboo tree to be stable enough for use as a construction material . moreover , bamboo is a high-yield renewable resource which , if harvested correctly , will sprout new shoots and grow back from the same plant – unlike most trees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in asia gallo pointed out that bamboo has other environmental advantages too .
" were we to start using bamboo instead of bricks , cement and steel , we would cut carbon emissions by over 200 tonnes per hectare , " he said . bamboo forests also help conserve biodiversity and prevent erosion , regulate groundwater and are biodegradeable .
" one hectare of bamboo alone recharges enough groundwater to supply 150 people , " says gallo .
" planting " houses bamboo can grow on every continent apart from europe , where the ground is too cold .
but not all the 600 different types of bamboo that exist are equally useful as a construction material , since not all of them have the same properties as guadua , for example , which is so ideal that it 's the main natural building material used for houses in colombia .
" in columbia , we talk about ' planting ' our houses , " says francisco gallo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guadua bamboo is exceptionally strong there seems to be no reason why this ' vegetable steel ' – as it 's often referred to in south america – should n't become increasingly common in construction .
but industrialized nations still need to wake up to its potential , said gallo , and conceded that extensive validation tests need to be done before it can be widely embraced .
" with a building component , it 's crucial to know exactly how sturdy and weatherproof it is , " he stressed .
" these tests still need to be done on bamboo . "
however , these necessitate new technologies , and various legal obstacles need to be overcome before bamboo can be certified to comply with strict eu standards , for example .
in this respect , its traditional use in industry gives standard wood an obvious advantage .
not taken seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamboo might soon bcome more popular as a building component in industrialized nations the trouble is , bamboo lacks a strong lobby in industrialized nations .
" when you mention bamboo , most people associate it with tropical regions and romantic islands dotted with holiday beach huts , " gallo said .
bamboo 's environmental credentials need to be promoted if it 's to gain greater popularity in mainstream use , gallo said , pointing out that in the long run it makes economic sense .
" for the time being you ca n't say that building with bamboo is cheaper , " he admitted .
" but long-term , a bamboo construction is a sound economic choice because it insulates well and helps reduce heating costs . "
both for countries that produce bamboo and for emerging nations , building with bamboo can have tangible economic benefits . gallo said a thriving bamboo industry would create jobs .
statistics show that the construction sector plays a key role in the economies of emerging nations , generating 21 percent of gross domestic product – almost 3 times the global average .
" a bamboo industry requires neither major machinery nor a well-developed infra-structure , " gallo said .
in coming decades , emerging nations will be concentrating heavily on expanding their cities .
if they started ' planting ' them , their economies might soon start to blossom .

it grows at the unusually fast rate of up to 15 centrimeters a day , which amounts to some 35 meters in 6 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 14.09.2010 financial reforms leave room for improvement , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers had a domino effect on other banks two years ago , the us financial crisis reached a tipping point with the crash of lehman brothers investment bank .
since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "

since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .

since then , governments have thrown billions of dollars at the problem .
what lessons have been learned ? on september 15 , 2008 , lehman brothers investment bank filed for bankruptcy .
as the global financial crisis unfolded , world governments spent vast amounts of money to prop up failing banks and cushion the economy from market shocks .
all in all , they coughed up 15 trillion euros -lrb- $ 19 trillion -rrb- - a third of the world 's annual economic output .
in the two years since then , politicians and financial managers have been busily debating new structures for a world financial system .
observers say some lessons have been learned - although the room for improvement is enormous .
" these lessons can be found in inner management , in strategy , and in the product design of the different banks , " said udo steffens , the president of the frankfurt school of finance and management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling prices gave traders around the world headaches but , he added , many concrete decisions are yet to be made .
the problem , as he sees it , is that regulation needs to be global - which means few of the necessary changes can be effectively implemented using national laws .
too little , and in the wrong place ?
for example , germany has prohibited the practice of so-called " naked short selling , " a speculative style of investment that negatively impacted financial markets during the crisis .
but that decision was largely symbolic , he said , because other financial markets have n't banned the practice .
indeed , the majority of naked short selling takes place in london .
what 's more , the german cabinet has passed a restructuring law which says that , starting in 2011 , all banks must contribute to a fund that could be tapped in the case of another crisis .
ideally , this would prevent taxpayers from having to cough up rescue money , he said .
but in a best-case scenario , that fund would receive 1.3 billion euros a year .
in comparison , the rescue package for germany 's wounded lender hypo real estate was worth 142 billion euros .
on the european level , a set of new financial oversight rules agreed in early september are being heralded as the most important development since the financial crisis began .
according to the regulations , starting in 2011 , three new regulatory agencies for banks , insurers and stock exchanges will have the last word if an internationally active financial institution gets into serious trouble .
however , this measure is more about crisis management than prevention , whereas the goal of the reforms was to do whatever it takes to prevent another vast financial crisis , steffens noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' naked short sales ' are banned in frankfurt - to little avail yet according to max otte , a finance professor at worms university of applied sciences , it would be easy to regulate banks by concentrating on three particular instruments .
the first of these is capital reserves .
until it went bankrupt , lehman brothers had some $ 500 billion in obligations based on just $ 20 billion core capital .
" if you prescribe that a bank needs to have 8 or 9 percent capital for a product , then investors will use more of their own money .
it will lead to people being more careful , " otte said .
after all , the most important part of capitalism is capital , he explained , adding that " banks need to have enough of it set aside , or else we have socialism for banks , like we do now . "
basel iii changes capital quotas on sunday , the basel committee on banking supervision , set higher capital quotas in an accord known as basel iii .
banks are currently required to have a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 percent , with half of that dubbed " core " tier 1 in the form of top quality capital such as retained earnings or shares , for maximum shock absorption .
under basel iii , the tier 1 capital ratio is pegged at 6 percent , with core tier 1 set at 4.5 percent . in addition , banks would be required to keep an emergency reserve , known as a " conservation buffer , " of 2.5 percent .
they will have to begin building the buffer by 2015 and must have it fully in place by january 1 , 2019 .
tallied up , the amount of rock-solid reserves banks are expected to have by the end of the decade will be 8.5 percent of their balance sheets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hypo real estate rescue cost taxpayers 142 billion euros a second instrument could be a tax on financial transactions , otte said .
" if every transaction is taxed at 0.05 percent , that wo n't hurt investors like me , who might reassess their investments once a year . "
but hedge funds , which use computer programs to constantly shift investments around , " would be affected a hundred times over by a tax . " so far , only germany and france have come out in favor of such a tax .
the us , great britain and larger emerging markets remain staunchly opposed to the measure .
derivatives markets still suspect the third instrument recommended by finance expert otte is more regulation of certain financial products , such as derivatives .
the trading volume of derivatives is around $ 600 trillion - many times higher than the gross national product of all the world 's economies . but for otto , the derivatives market is nothing more than a gambling casino .
the eu wants to make this currently unregulated market more transparent .
the us has already introduced stricter regulations for derivatives trading , although otte considers the other us financial market reforms as mere " window dressing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxpayers had to empty their pockets to finance the rescues " a few minor areas saw small improvements , but the basic core of the problem has not been touched , " he said .
so why is financial market reform taking place at such a snail 's pace ?
according to otte , the fault lies with banking lobbyists .
meanwhile , banking expert udo steffens says he doubts that the much-touted new " finance-market architecture " will come to pass .
" it will remain an architectural sketch , " he said .
" the market wo n't allow itself to be set in cement and stone . "

the ban is due to come into effect early 2011 if it is not overturned by senior judges . the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favor of a law banning women from wearing the muslim full-face veil in public .
the ban will come into force in six months ' time if it is not overturned by constitutional judges .
french president nicholas sarkozy has championed the ban , which will outlaw the veils known as the niqab and the burqa from public spaces such as streets and post offices .
the text of the bill made no mention of islam , but the sarkozy government has argued that the law was needed to protect muslim women from being forced to wear the full-face veil .
the law legislates a six-month " education " grace period for muslim women to understand that they face arrest or a fine if they flout the ban .
the fine could be as high as 150 euros -lrb- $ 195 -rrb- or the individual could be made to attend so-called citizenship lessons .
" this is not about security or religion , but about respecting our republican principles , " justice minister michele alliot-marie declared before the vote .
" france , land of secularism , guarantees respect for all religions -lrb- but -rrb- hiding the face under a veil is against public social order , whether it is forced or voluntary , " she said .
opponents of the law argue that it breaches french and european human rights laws .
belgium , spain and parts of italy are considering similar measures but the ban is particularly sensitive in france , which is home to europe 's biggest muslim minority .
muslims account for some 6 percent of the total population in france , however only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full-face veil in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 14.09.2010 german clubs could lift bundesliga above italy in uefa rankings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's internationals are even more a german-italian dogfight six german teams are bidding for glory as the champions and europa leagues get underway in earnest .
but they also have a shot of moving the bundesliga up a crucial notch in the uefa rankings . bayern , schalke , bremen , stuttgart , dortmund and leverkusen all have a chance to win some international silverware this season .
but even if they do n't achieve that , they could help the bundesliga acquire an extra spot in the champions league - and the extra millions of euros in revenue that go with it .
the top three leagues in europe all get three guaranteed berths and one qualification spot in club football 's premier competition .
italy 's serie a is currently the third-ranked league , but it 's a mere nose ahead of the bundesliga , with 64.3 and 64.2 points respectively .
in fact , germany is already ahead thanks to better results in early qualifiers in 2010 .
and even better for the bundesliga , it will automatically gain five points on italy next season since the uefa rankings are based only on the past five seasons , and 2005-6 , a year italy did well and germany did not , is set to be erased .
an extra champions league spot could mean an automatic increase of around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- coming into the bundesliga via the fourth-best club .
and that sum might increase .
uefa has set a new record in negotiating 1.1 billion euros for the marketing rights for the champions and europa leagues this season , and the future is looking bright .
so you would think that german fans , whatever their usual club allegiances , will all be rooting for bayern to win the cl in 2011 , right ?
well , not exactly .
germany 's prospects depend on much more than just bayern doing well .
a point is a point bildunterschrift : teams like dortmund are going to have a say in the battle many casual fans will be surprised to learned that the europa league - a competition whose forerunner the uefa cup was once famously dismissed by german footballing legend franz beckenbauer as the " cup of losers " - plays a crucial rule in determining the all-decisive co-efficient .
for reasons known only to uefa , wins in the europa league are treated as equally significant to victories achieved in the far more prestigious champions league .
extra points are only awarded for latter stages of the cl - otherwise , a win is a win .
this set-up has served the bundesliga well in recent years .
while only bayern have come within shouting distance of a champions league title in the past half-decade , good performances in the europa league by teams like schalke and bremen have racked up valuable points for the bundesliga in its pursuit of serie a. germany lost the fourth champions league spot to italy after the 2001-02 season , and a good example of the knock-on effects that had for an individual club is hertha berlin .
hertha finished fourth in the bundesliga in 2008-9 but had to reduce personnel expenditures and got relegated last season .
had they been given a chance at cl qualifications , there would n't have been the same need to save , and berlin might well have stayed up .
a fourth berth in the champions league is thus a potential boom or saving grace for middling-to-good bundesliga sides .
so how are germany 's chances of getting that lifeline back from italy ?
mixed bag bildunterschrift : both bremen and bayern have italian group-stage opponents bundesliga fans were cheered by the fact that four out of six german teams got relatively easy group-stage draws .
on the other hand , none of germany 's international participants have gotten off to particularly stellar starts to their domestic campaigns .
bayern , who play roma on wednesday , look a very good bet to progress , with cluj and basle their other opponents .
but elsewhere nothing can be taken for granted .
bremen were unlucky to draw reigning champions inter milan in their group , and their first group-stage match against tottenham hotspur on tuesday is no walk in the park .
dortmund also have a tough group in the europa league , while leverkusen , who host rosenberg trondheim on thursday , drew defending champions atletico madrid .
but the bundesliga 's biggest two worries are schalke and stuttgart , both of whom lost their first three domestic matches .
bildunterschrift : schalke could be the bundesliga 's achilles ' heel in europe international form and domestic form do n't always converge , of course , and sometimes a break from national competition can inspire an otherwise faltering team .
but if schalke and stuttgart do n't get their league campaigns back on track , they could de-prioritize their respective champions and europa league matches - which could deal a crushing blow to the bundesliga 's chances of moving up the rankings .
still , none of the serie a sides in the international competitions managed to win their first two league domestic matches either , and leaving aside inter milan , the italian league in general looks neither strong nor deep .
bayern will have a chance to draw first head-to-head blood against rome , and bremen have the opportunity to do further damage in their tie against inter .
whatever happens , this is going to be a competitive and interesting international season in terms of not only the top clubs ' battle for the two international titles , but two leagues ' struggle for a place in europe 's top three .
