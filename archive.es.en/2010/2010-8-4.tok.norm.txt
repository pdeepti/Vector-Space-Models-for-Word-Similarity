but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit .

" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .

it came as a surprise to some that a story about shit became an international hit . it 's all just a load of shit - there 's really no other way to put it .
and shit is something author werner holzwarth has thought a lot about . " at that time , in the mid-1980s , my son was maybe three or four years old , we were going for a walk in the park in frankfurt , " holzwarth said .
" he noticed all of the dog droppings and wanted to play with them .
and i thought , to keep him away from them , i 'll buy him a book . " while shitty books abound , there was no book about shit available in german , so holzwarth wrote his own . the simple plot unfolds over 20 pages with large pictures .
one day , a mole comes out of his hole and - plop ! - something lands on his head .
naturally , he is disgusted . but instead of washing his head , the mole decides to get to the bottom of it and find out exactly who was responsible for the rather stinky and unpleasant mishap .
he goes from animal to animal , comparing their patties , droppings and poop to the pile on his head .
whether pigeon , horse , pig or goat - no one seems to be the culprit . still , the mole remains persistent . " he 's my kind of character , " said holzwarth .
" he does n't accept just any answer . " bildunterschrift : the little mole goes from animal to animal , asking who pooped on his head he who seeks shall find the book 's universal theme went over well .
since it came out in 1989 , 1.2 million copies of the german version have been sold .
but it 's also been translated into 33 languages .
whether in china , bolivia , saudi arabia or iceland - everyone knows the stubborn little mole . holzwarth said he is amazed at the reception his book has received . " in the beginning , everyone thought it was gross , " he said .
" the topic was taboo .
what grandma is going to buy her grandchild a book about shit ? " the author spent two years trying to sell his story to a publishing house , but no one was interested .
some called it " unappetizing " or said it was too alternative and reeked of 1968 . but instead of giving up , holzwarth remained as unrelenting as the mole he had created and went in search of an illustrator .
he found wolf erlbruch , who he had met while working in the advertising industry .
finally , a small publishing house - the peter hammer verlag - agreed to publish the experimental work . for erlbruch , it meant the beginning of a successful international career as an illustrator . " it filled a market niche , " said holzwarth . bildunterschrift : obviously , it was n't the cow an eye for an eye now over 20 years old , the little mole - who still remains nameless - has taken on many forms .
in addition to the traditional children 's book , the story has also been performed as a musical and recorded as an audio book . " the most beautiful version of the mole is the french edition for the blind , " commented holzwarth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner holzwarth was inspired to write about shit by his son the persistent mole , of course , discovers the poop perpetrator : it was the butcher 's dog hans-heinerich . and the mole promptly gets his revenge . " the dog wakes up and notices that there is something on his head and ca n't let it rest , " explained holzwarth .

they also have their eyes set on china ’ s growing middle class car buyers .
in germany , a world leader , the reactions have generally been favorable . the sale was done with geely transferring 1.8 billion dollars to ford .
geely group chairman li shufu said it was a " historic day " for the company , which would invest 900 million dollars into improving the brand . geely has nominated the german stefan jacoby , the head of volkswagen in america , as volvo 's new president and chief executive . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a car expert who teaches at duisburg university , said that this was a good decision because jacoby had been instrumental in helping volkswagen expand in china , which has huge potential . he explained that what was needed first of all was to set up " a manufacturing base in china if the company wants to expand .
secondly , it will have to become stronger in the american market .
it will need stronger products and will then gradually make its way across the market but the road will be long .
volvo is struggling today compared to mercedes and bmw . " expanding in the luxury market will take time geely has also said it wants to expand in the luxury market but dudenhoeffer warned that this would not happen overnight .
" it will need a lot of effort and will mean more engineering .
a lot needs to be integrated .
let ’ s see what the situation looks like in 10 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volvo needs to sell 500,000 mid-range models to make its mark in china he added that to compete with other manufacturers in the luxury sector , volvo would first have to improve its sales in mid-range models and reach well beyond the 500,000 mark . the big names in the luxury sector remain mercedes and bmw , which are still in german hands . generally , the reaction in germany to the takeover of volvo by geely has been rather subdued .
some traders said customers had no reason to be concerned . " there ’ s been little negative reaction , of course people are always a bit skeptical at the beginning but if you put forward arguments they see it as a positive development , just as we do .
we have very few negative feelings towards the takeover , " one volvo trader in munich said . volvo will " remain true to its core values " one of the arguments is that the cars are likely to become cheaper ; another is that volvo ’ s hq and plants will remain in europe and that management will retain its autonomy .
moreover , the new owners insist that volvo , which is known for its family-friendly cars , " will remain true to its core values of safety , quality , environmental care and modern design . " bildunterschrift : volvo is renowned for family-friendly cars with high safety standards " it makes no difference for the model i have , " one long-time volvo driver said .
" but i can imagine that in four or five years if we want to buy another car we might ask the question about quality standards .
we ’ ll have to talk with people who know more but of course one can never be certain . " what is certain is that companies all over the world are scrambling to get their share of china ’ s booming car market . author : anne thomas editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 04.08.2010 global wheat prices soar as russia cuts crop forecast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia could halve grain exports in 2010 facing severe drought and rampaging wildfires , russia has dropped its grain crop forecast for 2010 .
the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 04.08.2010 paris plans to launch electric car sharing program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars may become a standard sight on paris ' streets paris may soon add hosting the world 's largest electric car sharing program to its list of green accolades .
but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .
those changes include improved public transportation options , heightened restrictions on cars and velib , a bike sharing program that began in 2007 . same perks , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of the bikes in the velib program have been damaged while officials like lepetit hope that autolib can duplicate some of the successes of the bike sharing program , a car sharing venture is also be open to some of the same criticisms . nearly 8,000 of the 20,000 bikes involved in the velib program were either stolen or severely vandalized , especially in the period following velib 's introduction . a car share program also introduces concerns that go beyond vandalism , said bill moore , publisher of ev world , an online magazine about electronic vehicles . " i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .
currently , four bidders are vying to operate autolib , which will be structured as a public-private partnership with the city of paris .
they include avis car rental and the french railway operator sncf . city officials have said they have learned important lessons from velib , and that autolib system will be much harder to defraud or steal from .
but supporters and skeptics agree that the program also depends on being embraced by everyone in society - including the disgruntled youths who have been known to burn cars . author : eleanor beardsley -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spill is now the largest in history , but experts are expected to show that its impact will be less than some feared . following eight hours of pumping mud into its blown oil well , bp announced on wednesday that the well has reached a static condition .
the company began the pumping operation known as a " static kill " on tuesday . a static condition signals a state where pressure from the mud stops the leak by offsetting pressure in the reservoir that causes the oil to shoot to the surface .
tuesday 's maneuver was an alternative to the company 's failed attempt to install a valve over the well to stem the gushing oil . " a static situation basically means you can have just fluid in the hole , and you do n't need to have a valve shut at the surface to have the well killed , " said bp senior vice president kent wells at a press conference on tuesday . the company 's next and final step in killing the well involves pumping cement into the site .
in the coming days , the company will monitor the well in order to decide whether to begin pumping cement immediately or wait until mid-august when drilling on the first relief well is expected to be completed . the " static kill " would take 33 to 61 hours to complete , officials said before wednesday 's announcement . not until cement has been successfully pumped in and the relief wells are finished can the well be considered fully closed , according to us coast guard admiral thad allen , who has headed the government 's response to the spill . not regular mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drilling mud has a thick , pasty consistency in this bp image capture unlike regular mud , the mud pumped into the well is itself a feat of engineering .

it came as a surprise to some that a story about shit became an international hit . it 's all just a load of shit - there 's really no other way to put it .
and shit is something author werner holzwarth has thought a lot about . " at that time , in the mid-1980s , my son was maybe three or four years old , we were going for a walk in the park in frankfurt , " holzwarth said .
" he noticed all of the dog droppings and wanted to play with them .
and i thought , to keep him away from them , i 'll buy him a book . " while shitty books abound , there was no book about shit available in german , so holzwarth wrote his own . the simple plot unfolds over 20 pages with large pictures .
one day , a mole comes out of his hole and - plop ! - something lands on his head .
naturally , he is disgusted . but instead of washing his head , the mole decides to get to the bottom of it and find out exactly who was responsible for the rather stinky and unpleasant mishap .
he goes from animal to animal , comparing their patties , droppings and poop to the pile on his head .
whether pigeon , horse , pig or goat - no one seems to be the culprit . still , the mole remains persistent . " he 's my kind of character , " said holzwarth .
" he does n't accept just any answer . " bildunterschrift : the little mole goes from animal to animal , asking who pooped on his head he who seeks shall find the book 's universal theme went over well .
since it came out in 1989 , 1.2 million copies of the german version have been sold .
but it 's also been translated into 33 languages .
whether in china , bolivia , saudi arabia or iceland - everyone knows the stubborn little mole . holzwarth said he is amazed at the reception his book has received . " in the beginning , everyone thought it was gross , " he said .
" the topic was taboo .
what grandma is going to buy her grandchild a book about shit ? " the author spent two years trying to sell his story to a publishing house , but no one was interested .
some called it " unappetizing " or said it was too alternative and reeked of 1968 . but instead of giving up , holzwarth remained as unrelenting as the mole he had created and went in search of an illustrator .

it came as a surprise to some that a story about shit became an international hit . it 's all just a load of shit - there 's really no other way to put it .
and shit is something author werner holzwarth has thought a lot about . " at that time , in the mid-1980s , my son was maybe three or four years old , we were going for a walk in the park in frankfurt , " holzwarth said .
" he noticed all of the dog droppings and wanted to play with them .
and i thought , to keep him away from them , i 'll buy him a book . " while shitty books abound , there was no book about shit available in german , so holzwarth wrote his own . the simple plot unfolds over 20 pages with large pictures .
one day , a mole comes out of his hole and - plop ! - something lands on his head .
naturally , he is disgusted . but instead of washing his head , the mole decides to get to the bottom of it and find out exactly who was responsible for the rather stinky and unpleasant mishap .
he goes from animal to animal , comparing their patties , droppings and poop to the pile on his head .
whether pigeon , horse , pig or goat - no one seems to be the culprit . still , the mole remains persistent . " he 's my kind of character , " said holzwarth .
" he does n't accept just any answer . " bildunterschrift : the little mole goes from animal to animal , asking who pooped on his head he who seeks shall find the book 's universal theme went over well .
since it came out in 1989 , 1.2 million copies of the german version have been sold .
but it 's also been translated into 33 languages .
whether in china , bolivia , saudi arabia or iceland - everyone knows the stubborn little mole . holzwarth said he is amazed at the reception his book has received . " in the beginning , everyone thought it was gross , " he said .
" the topic was taboo .
what grandma is going to buy her grandchild a book about shit ? " the author spent two years trying to sell his story to a publishing house , but no one was interested .
some called it " unappetizing " or said it was too alternative and reeked of 1968 . but instead of giving up , holzwarth remained as unrelenting as the mole he had created and went in search of an illustrator .
he found wolf erlbruch , who he had met while working in the advertising industry .
finally , a small publishing house - the peter hammer verlag - agreed to publish the experimental work . for erlbruch , it meant the beginning of a successful international career as an illustrator . " it filled a market niche , " said holzwarth . bildunterschrift : obviously , it was n't the cow an eye for an eye now over 20 years old , the little mole - who still remains nameless - has taken on many forms .

but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .
those changes include improved public transportation options , heightened restrictions on cars and velib , a bike sharing program that began in 2007 . same perks , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of the bikes in the velib program have been damaged while officials like lepetit hope that autolib can duplicate some of the successes of the bike sharing program , a car sharing venture is also be open to some of the same criticisms . nearly 8,000 of the 20,000 bikes involved in the velib program were either stolen or severely vandalized , especially in the period following velib 's introduction . a car share program also introduces concerns that go beyond vandalism , said bill moore , publisher of ev world , an online magazine about electronic vehicles . " i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .
currently , four bidders are vying to operate autolib , which will be structured as a public-private partnership with the city of paris .
they include avis car rental and the french railway operator sncf . city officials have said they have learned important lessons from velib , and that autolib system will be much harder to defraud or steal from .

but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .

" i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .

" once again we have to pay for a player that we handed over to someone else .

" in my opinion , it was irresponsible that the injury was not better diagnosed and that arjen was allowed to play . "

robben himself expressed shock at the results of the scan and surprise at the length of his forced break .

in germany , a world leader , the reactions have generally been favorable . the sale was done with geely transferring 1.8 billion dollars to ford .
geely group chairman li shufu said it was a " historic day " for the company , which would invest 900 million dollars into improving the brand . geely has nominated the german stefan jacoby , the head of volkswagen in america , as volvo 's new president and chief executive . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a car expert who teaches at duisburg university , said that this was a good decision because jacoby had been instrumental in helping volkswagen expand in china , which has huge potential . he explained that what was needed first of all was to set up " a manufacturing base in china if the company wants to expand .

the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .

exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .

on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .

the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .

" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

a break-away group of former allies abstained in a vote against a junior minister , avoiding a fresh general election for now . the conservative coalition of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has passed its first test in parliament since a damaging defection of members of his party  avoiding any immediate need for a general election .
" we will not go to the polls for now , " said minister for reforms umberto bossi .
supporters of berlusconi 's estranged former political ally gianfranco fini declined to take part in a vote of no-confidence against junior justice minister giacomo caliendo .
the motion , put forward by opposition parties , was defeated in the lower house chamber of deputies with 299 votes against , 229 votes in favor and 75 abstentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister maroni said elections in september were possible berlusconi had moved to expel fini from the center-right people of freedom party last week .
fini left - but took 33 other parliamentarians with him to join the new future and freedom party .
crucially , this denied berlusconi and his allies a majority in parliament and the premier threatened early elections if provoked by fini .
caliendo is under police investigation for allegedly trying to sell political influence .
fini and his allies avoided a showdown at the ballot box by opting for an abstention .
' sailing without a compass ' however , interior minister roberto maroni - from berlusconi 's main coalition partners the northern league - said that a general election could take place when parliament resumes in september .
maroni said that berlusconi 's two-year-old government was " sailing without a compass " following the split .

but saudi arabia and others are challenging that security with a suspension on blackberry service . saudi arabia is the latest country to announce suspensions in service to blackberry smartphones , citing conflicts between the mobile devices and the country 's communications regulations . saudi arabia 's decision today to cut service to blackberrys starting on august 6 follows a similar announcement made by the united arab emirates on august 1 . the uae plans to end e-mail and internet browsing service for blackberrys starting in october . other countries in the region like egypt and kuwait have also expressed concern about use of the devices , and kuwait successfully lobbied blackberry 's manufacturer to block some 3,000 pornographic sites from being accessed on its phones used in the country . " the decision to ban blackberrys was made after talks between the uae and blackberry 's manufacturer ' research in motion ' failed , " said uae-based journalist abdoullah al-moutawe , in an interview with deutsche welle . " just like in other gulf states , the uae wants access to the encrypted information being sent from here into foreign countries .
the usa and great britain have that right , so why should n't we ? " resistance from media , business french ngo reporters without borders has criticized the bans as an attack on press freedom and has drawn attention to the imprisonment of uae residents who organized a protest against gas prices using their blackberrys . " blackberrys are generally used in the gulf region to trade information on social and economic topics , " said gilles lordet , reporters without borders spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle . " blackberrys pose no national security threat in our estimation .
rather , the governments in the gulf region are unaccustomed to dealing with criticism , like in the recent case of gas price protests in the uae . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackberry phones are a staple in dubai 's business world the uae has around 500,000 blackberry subscribers - including many journalists who work for major media outlets in dubai like cnn and al-arabia . saudi arabia currently hosts 700,000 subscriptions . resistance to the bans is expected not only from the media but also from major businesses , many of whom have come to rely on blackberrys as an indispensible business tool . " experts expect to see a 40 percent drop in sales of blackberrys , " al-moutawe said . " that 's why the uae is planning to put a similar device that it made on the market soon . " blackberry bans may spread blackberrys are also encountering resistance in major markets beyond the gulf region . india is also pressuring manufacturer research in motion to gain access to encrypted data exchanged via blackberrys .
the country has not yet announced a ban on services , though , although the economic times cited an anonymous indian official on wednesday as saying the country will consider banning mobile services that can not be monitored . rim has expressed resistance to opening up its networks to surveillance by indian authorities . " we wo n't compromise on the security architecture of our corporate e-mails , " said rim 's india spokesman satchit gayakwad , in an interview with the associated press . we respect the requirements of regulatory bodies in terms of security , but we also look at the customer 's need for privacy . " while india and gulf countries have framed their concerns about blackberrys as national security issues , gilles lordet of reporters without borders , sees a broader conflict at stake . " in the gulf region , there is fundamental tension between the state and the citizens when it comes to freedom of opinion .
as soon as the citizens try to improve their ability to communicate freely with new technologies , government agencies step in to find ways to restrict them , " he said . author : hicham drioiuch -lrb- gsw / ap -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .

for this we are ever grateful .
we could not possibly fit all the comments we receive onto our web page but here is a very small selection : here are the long awaited winning inbox profiles for the months of april and may : april 2010 : suman kumar from mumbai , india : “ my name is my name and it 's a good name is n't it ?
i am proud to be male , but at the same time i give due respect to females .
i have crossed three decades of my life but still have no good luck in finding a life partner .
i don ’ t have any hope that my future wife is listening to my profile which you are reading on deutsche welle radio ! ! !
i am not too optimistic , but i am not pessimistic either .
i have worked and am still working hard to make a good number of successes in my life .
i like walking a lot .
i walk on an average 6 kms daily . i cook for myself : breakfast lunch and dinner .
and of course i like my own cooked meal ... too much .
i can cook almost every indian food and try cooking some chinese stuff also .but but but … ..
i am a lacto-ovo-vegetarian and eat no meat and no fish .
i live alone in mumbai - around 2800 kms away from my native place .
mumbai is a very crowded and costly city and it is very difficult to live a decent live here .
now just to change the tone .
i am a mechanical engineer by profession and have changed jobs a couple of times .
i have visited germany twice and have visited france and holland too .
as i am writing this email , i am in the state of texas in the united states of america but will be back in india next week and then i will catch up with dw on my cranky radio .
i guess when i last heard dw my cell was down , so i will be charging it once i am back home .
i like listening to dw in english and hindi - and sometimes in urdu and bengali too .
so i am a multi lingual listener of dw ha ha ha ..
to be specific inbox is a really nice program ... i like it .
i also like living planet and asia compact , too .
by and take care for the time being .
i will catch your signal once i am back home . ” may 2010 yaaqub jaidi in kakamega in kenya . “ i would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your collaborative effort , support and guidance that have led to numerous programs aimed at improving the lot of african people all over the world .
deutsche welle radio and television programs really stimulate me .
deutsche welle rocks me up .
there are many people listening to deutsche welle radio including young kids .
i have a little brother called killian and he really likes deutsche welle .
you guys really produce genuine programs and shows and i hope you will present as many programs as possible .
thanks to your show i can stay informed and learn about what is going on in the world .
no matter how busy my schedules are or how harsh the internet blockade , i watch your tv programs and shows regularly and like it very much . “ congratulations to you both upon having written the chosen profiles for the months of april and may ! the following comments have not won their authors a prize but the inbox team certainly appreciated receiving them and we are pleased to share them with you , our readers !
a friend of ours from uganda , bahati ibrahim , sent us this message : " i hope you are hale and hearty , wish you all the very best indeed !
yeah !
it ’ s a little bit sunny here in uganda and many extra greetings from us here : that ’ s from me and my friends and family .
i am emailing to inform you that i have received the mp3 player . i love it so much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
now you can be sure that i will download all my favourite programs whenever i want - all day and night !
but that does not mean i vacate shortwave – that ’ s been part of me from the start !
love you so much , indeed .
allow me to keep listening and hoping the very best is always to come from the heart of europe in bonn .
many extra thanks indeed ! ” richard baah from asesewa in the eastern region of ghana has been a deutsche welle listener for quite some time and had this to say : “ this year marks my 40 years of correspondence with deutsche welle .
it was in 1970 when i first wrote to you .
i found the dw advert at the back of scala magazine now the deutschland magazine .
if i look back over the years i will say i am elated and very happy .
in those years gone by , the program schedules first came every two months and in the german language .
eventually hallo friends and yearly calendars were the order of the day .
from cologne to bonn , dw has grown by leaps and bounds . ” wang meng chose to send this message : “ i love dw very much .
i got to know it via livestation.com and find the broadcast both interesting and beneficial .
it has much deeper reports compared with france24 , rfi , etc .
it is also a great source for learning about germany and europe , also to enhance my english .
i am always interested in the german culture , especially in their serious way of doing business , their precision , sophisticated philosophy and classical music .
i would hope you could focus more on china and asia in your english program , so i could view my own country from a german / european perspective .
best regards wang meng ” as always , here at inbox we love to hear from our listeners and – where possible – your response will be featured in inbox or on the inbox page .
many thanks for your continued interest .

but saudi arabia and others are challenging that security with a suspension on blackberry service . saudi arabia is the latest country to announce suspensions in service to blackberry smartphones , citing conflicts between the mobile devices and the country 's communications regulations . saudi arabia 's decision today to cut service to blackberrys starting on august 6 follows a similar announcement made by the united arab emirates on august 1 . the uae plans to end e-mail and internet browsing service for blackberrys starting in october . other countries in the region like egypt and kuwait have also expressed concern about use of the devices , and kuwait successfully lobbied blackberry 's manufacturer to block some 3,000 pornographic sites from being accessed on its phones used in the country . " the decision to ban blackberrys was made after talks between the uae and blackberry 's manufacturer ' research in motion ' failed , " said uae-based journalist abdoullah al-moutawe , in an interview with deutsche welle . " just like in other gulf states , the uae wants access to the encrypted information being sent from here into foreign countries .
the usa and great britain have that right , so why should n't we ? " resistance from media , business french ngo reporters without borders has criticized the bans as an attack on press freedom and has drawn attention to the imprisonment of uae residents who organized a protest against gas prices using their blackberrys . " blackberrys are generally used in the gulf region to trade information on social and economic topics , " said gilles lordet , reporters without borders spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle . " blackberrys pose no national security threat in our estimation .
rather , the governments in the gulf region are unaccustomed to dealing with criticism , like in the recent case of gas price protests in the uae . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackberry phones are a staple in dubai 's business world the uae has around 500,000 blackberry subscribers - including many journalists who work for major media outlets in dubai like cnn and al-arabia . saudi arabia currently hosts 700,000 subscriptions . resistance to the bans is expected not only from the media but also from major businesses , many of whom have come to rely on blackberrys as an indispensible business tool . " experts expect to see a 40 percent drop in sales of blackberrys , " al-moutawe said . " that 's why the uae is planning to put a similar device that it made on the market soon . " blackberry bans may spread blackberrys are also encountering resistance in major markets beyond the gulf region . india is also pressuring manufacturer research in motion to gain access to encrypted data exchanged via blackberrys .
the country has not yet announced a ban on services , though , although the economic times cited an anonymous indian official on wednesday as saying the country will consider banning mobile services that can not be monitored . rim has expressed resistance to opening up its networks to surveillance by indian authorities . " we wo n't compromise on the security architecture of our corporate e-mails , " said rim 's india spokesman satchit gayakwad , in an interview with the associated press . we respect the requirements of regulatory bodies in terms of security , but we also look at the customer 's need for privacy . " while india and gulf countries have framed their concerns about blackberrys as national security issues , gilles lordet of reporters without borders , sees a broader conflict at stake . " in the gulf region , there is fundamental tension between the state and the citizens when it comes to freedom of opinion .
as soon as the citizens try to improve their ability to communicate freely with new technologies , government agencies step in to find ways to restrict them , " he said . author : hicham drioiuch -lrb- gsw / ap -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.08.2010 will germans ever embrace pay-tv ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't convinced they should pay more for television pay-tv operator sky deutschland announced it will raise 340 million euros in new capital as profits remain out of reach .
consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

a break-away group of former allies abstained in a vote against a junior minister , avoiding a fresh general election for now . the conservative coalition of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has passed its first test in parliament since a damaging defection of members of his party  avoiding any immediate need for a general election .
" we will not go to the polls for now , " said minister for reforms umberto bossi .
supporters of berlusconi 's estranged former political ally gianfranco fini declined to take part in a vote of no-confidence against junior justice minister giacomo caliendo .
the motion , put forward by opposition parties , was defeated in the lower house chamber of deputies with 299 votes against , 229 votes in favor and 75 abstentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister maroni said elections in september were possible berlusconi had moved to expel fini from the center-right people of freedom party last week .
fini left - but took 33 other parliamentarians with him to join the new future and freedom party .
crucially , this denied berlusconi and his allies a majority in parliament and the premier threatened early elections if provoked by fini .
caliendo is under police investigation for allegedly trying to sell political influence .
fini and his allies avoided a showdown at the ballot box by opting for an abstention .
' sailing without a compass ' however , interior minister roberto maroni - from berlusconi 's main coalition partners the northern league - said that a general election could take place when parliament resumes in september .
maroni said that berlusconi 's two-year-old government was " sailing without a compass " following the split .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections in italy usually take place in the spring " if the ship hits the rocks , we go back to the polls , " maroni told the italian daily newspaper corriere della sera on wednesday .
the minister added that the government might be forced to break with its usual procedure of holding elections in springtime .
" i know there are no precedents for holding elections in the autumn , but that should not be ruled out in the face of a serious political crisis . "
berlusconi is believed to favor early elections if he does not have sufficient backing in parliament .
although the 73-year-old 's coalition has seen its popularity slide recently , the center-left opposition is so fragmented that he could win an early poll .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 04.08.2010 global wheat prices soar as russia cuts crop forecast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia could halve grain exports in 2010 facing severe drought and rampaging wildfires , russia has dropped its grain crop forecast for 2010 .
the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .

" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

the club claims robben should not have played for his country after picking up an injury bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said he was angry that his club would suffer the consequences of an injury picked up at the world cup by arjen robben .
" we are n't only disappointed , we are very annoyed , " rummenigge told the german daily newspaper muenchner merkur .
" once again we have to pay for a player that we handed over to someone else .
i have asked fifa to mediate in the matter . "
bayern said that a routine pre-season exam showed that the winger had a torn muscle in his left thigh , having suffered the injury shortly before the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge welcomed robben to the club last summer the 26-year-old missed the first two group matches for his country at the tournament in south africa , but played in the remaining five - helping the netherlands to reach the final where they lost 1-0 to spain .
" we are dealing with a serious injury , " said bayern club doctor hans wilhelm mueller-wohlfahrt .
" in my opinion , it was irresponsible that the injury was not better diagnosed and that arjen was allowed to play . "
strongly-worded condemnation the club had initially issued a strongly-worded statement blaming the dutch on its website , before replacing it with a more moderate version .
robben himself expressed shock at the results of the scan and surprise at the length of his forced break .
the former chelsea and real madrid player joined louis van gaal 's side early last season , helping bayern to clinch a bundesliga and german cup double and a place in the champions league final .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 04.08.2010 paris plans to launch electric car sharing program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars may become a standard sight on paris ' streets paris may soon add hosting the world 's largest electric car sharing program to its list of green accolades .
but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .
those changes include improved public transportation options , heightened restrictions on cars and velib , a bike sharing program that began in 2007 . same perks , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of the bikes in the velib program have been damaged while officials like lepetit hope that autolib can duplicate some of the successes of the bike sharing program , a car sharing venture is also be open to some of the same criticisms . nearly 8,000 of the 20,000 bikes involved in the velib program were either stolen or severely vandalized , especially in the period following velib 's introduction . a car share program also introduces concerns that go beyond vandalism , said bill moore , publisher of ev world , an online magazine about electronic vehicles . " i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .
currently , four bidders are vying to operate autolib , which will be structured as a public-private partnership with the city of paris .
they include avis car rental and the french railway operator sncf . city officials have said they have learned important lessons from velib , and that autolib system will be much harder to defraud or steal from .
but supporters and skeptics agree that the program also depends on being embraced by everyone in society - including the disgruntled youths who have been known to burn cars . author : eleanor beardsley -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .
those changes include improved public transportation options , heightened restrictions on cars and velib , a bike sharing program that began in 2007 . same perks , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of the bikes in the velib program have been damaged while officials like lepetit hope that autolib can duplicate some of the successes of the bike sharing program , a car sharing venture is also be open to some of the same criticisms . nearly 8,000 of the 20,000 bikes involved in the velib program were either stolen or severely vandalized , especially in the period following velib 's introduction . a car share program also introduces concerns that go beyond vandalism , said bill moore , publisher of ev world , an online magazine about electronic vehicles . " i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .
currently , four bidders are vying to operate autolib , which will be structured as a public-private partnership with the city of paris .
they include avis car rental and the french railway operator sncf . city officials have said they have learned important lessons from velib , and that autolib system will be much harder to defraud or steal from .

but saudi arabia and others are challenging that security with a suspension on blackberry service . saudi arabia is the latest country to announce suspensions in service to blackberry smartphones , citing conflicts between the mobile devices and the country 's communications regulations . saudi arabia 's decision today to cut service to blackberrys starting on august 6 follows a similar announcement made by the united arab emirates on august 1 . the uae plans to end e-mail and internet browsing service for blackberrys starting in october . other countries in the region like egypt and kuwait have also expressed concern about use of the devices , and kuwait successfully lobbied blackberry 's manufacturer to block some 3,000 pornographic sites from being accessed on its phones used in the country . " the decision to ban blackberrys was made after talks between the uae and blackberry 's manufacturer ' research in motion ' failed , " said uae-based journalist abdoullah al-moutawe , in an interview with deutsche welle . " just like in other gulf states , the uae wants access to the encrypted information being sent from here into foreign countries .
the usa and great britain have that right , so why should n't we ? " resistance from media , business french ngo reporters without borders has criticized the bans as an attack on press freedom and has drawn attention to the imprisonment of uae residents who organized a protest against gas prices using their blackberrys . " blackberrys are generally used in the gulf region to trade information on social and economic topics , " said gilles lordet , reporters without borders spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle . " blackberrys pose no national security threat in our estimation .
rather , the governments in the gulf region are unaccustomed to dealing with criticism , like in the recent case of gas price protests in the uae . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackberry phones are a staple in dubai 's business world the uae has around 500,000 blackberry subscribers - including many journalists who work for major media outlets in dubai like cnn and al-arabia . saudi arabia currently hosts 700,000 subscriptions . resistance to the bans is expected not only from the media but also from major businesses , many of whom have come to rely on blackberrys as an indispensible business tool . " experts expect to see a 40 percent drop in sales of blackberrys , " al-moutawe said . " that 's why the uae is planning to put a similar device that it made on the market soon . " blackberry bans may spread blackberrys are also encountering resistance in major markets beyond the gulf region . india is also pressuring manufacturer research in motion to gain access to encrypted data exchanged via blackberrys .
the country has not yet announced a ban on services , though , although the economic times cited an anonymous indian official on wednesday as saying the country will consider banning mobile services that can not be monitored . rim has expressed resistance to opening up its networks to surveillance by indian authorities . " we wo n't compromise on the security architecture of our corporate e-mails , " said rim 's india spokesman satchit gayakwad , in an interview with the associated press . we respect the requirements of regulatory bodies in terms of security , but we also look at the customer 's need for privacy . " while india and gulf countries have framed their concerns about blackberrys as national security issues , gilles lordet of reporters without borders , sees a broader conflict at stake . " in the gulf region , there is fundamental tension between the state and the citizens when it comes to freedom of opinion .
as soon as the citizens try to improve their ability to communicate freely with new technologies , government agencies step in to find ways to restrict them , " he said . author : hicham drioiuch -lrb- gsw / ap -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but saudi arabia and others are challenging that security with a suspension on blackberry service . saudi arabia is the latest country to announce suspensions in service to blackberry smartphones , citing conflicts between the mobile devices and the country 's communications regulations . saudi arabia 's decision today to cut service to blackberrys starting on august 6 follows a similar announcement made by the united arab emirates on august 1 . the uae plans to end e-mail and internet browsing service for blackberrys starting in october . other countries in the region like egypt and kuwait have also expressed concern about use of the devices , and kuwait successfully lobbied blackberry 's manufacturer to block some 3,000 pornographic sites from being accessed on its phones used in the country . " the decision to ban blackberrys was made after talks between the uae and blackberry 's manufacturer ' research in motion ' failed , " said uae-based journalist abdoullah al-moutawe , in an interview with deutsche welle . " just like in other gulf states , the uae wants access to the encrypted information being sent from here into foreign countries .
the usa and great britain have that right , so why should n't we ? " resistance from media , business french ngo reporters without borders has criticized the bans as an attack on press freedom and has drawn attention to the imprisonment of uae residents who organized a protest against gas prices using their blackberrys . " blackberrys are generally used in the gulf region to trade information on social and economic topics , " said gilles lordet , reporters without borders spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle . " blackberrys pose no national security threat in our estimation .
rather , the governments in the gulf region are unaccustomed to dealing with criticism , like in the recent case of gas price protests in the uae . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackberry phones are a staple in dubai 's business world the uae has around 500,000 blackberry subscribers - including many journalists who work for major media outlets in dubai like cnn and al-arabia . saudi arabia currently hosts 700,000 subscriptions . resistance to the bans is expected not only from the media but also from major businesses , many of whom have come to rely on blackberrys as an indispensible business tool . " experts expect to see a 40 percent drop in sales of blackberrys , " al-moutawe said . " that 's why the uae is planning to put a similar device that it made on the market soon . " blackberry bans may spread blackberrys are also encountering resistance in major markets beyond the gulf region . india is also pressuring manufacturer research in motion to gain access to encrypted data exchanged via blackberrys .
the country has not yet announced a ban on services , though , although the economic times cited an anonymous indian official on wednesday as saying the country will consider banning mobile services that can not be monitored . rim has expressed resistance to opening up its networks to surveillance by indian authorities . " we wo n't compromise on the security architecture of our corporate e-mails , " said rim 's india spokesman satchit gayakwad , in an interview with the associated press . we respect the requirements of regulatory bodies in terms of security , but we also look at the customer 's need for privacy . " while india and gulf countries have framed their concerns about blackberrys as national security issues , gilles lordet of reporters without borders , sees a broader conflict at stake . " in the gulf region , there is fundamental tension between the state and the citizens when it comes to freedom of opinion .
as soon as the citizens try to improve their ability to communicate freely with new technologies , government agencies step in to find ways to restrict them , " he said . author : hicham drioiuch -lrb- gsw / ap -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .

" i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .
currently , four bidders are vying to operate autolib , which will be structured as a public-private partnership with the city of paris .
they include avis car rental and the french railway operator sncf . city officials have said they have learned important lessons from velib , and that autolib system will be much harder to defraud or steal from .

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .
those changes include improved public transportation options , heightened restrictions on cars and velib , a bike sharing program that began in 2007 . same perks , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of the bikes in the velib program have been damaged while officials like lepetit hope that autolib can duplicate some of the successes of the bike sharing program , a car sharing venture is also be open to some of the same criticisms . nearly 8,000 of the 20,000 bikes involved in the velib program were either stolen or severely vandalized , especially in the period following velib 's introduction . a car share program also introduces concerns that go beyond vandalism , said bill moore , publisher of ev world , an online magazine about electronic vehicles . " i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .
currently , four bidders are vying to operate autolib , which will be structured as a public-private partnership with the city of paris .
they include avis car rental and the french railway operator sncf . city officials have said they have learned important lessons from velib , and that autolib system will be much harder to defraud or steal from .

but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .
those changes include improved public transportation options , heightened restrictions on cars and velib , a bike sharing program that began in 2007 . same perks , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of the bikes in the velib program have been damaged while officials like lepetit hope that autolib can duplicate some of the successes of the bike sharing program , a car sharing venture is also be open to some of the same criticisms . nearly 8,000 of the 20,000 bikes involved in the velib program were either stolen or severely vandalized , especially in the period following velib 's introduction . a car share program also introduces concerns that go beyond vandalism , said bill moore , publisher of ev world , an online magazine about electronic vehicles . " i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .
currently , four bidders are vying to operate autolib , which will be structured as a public-private partnership with the city of paris .
they include avis car rental and the french railway operator sncf . city officials have said they have learned important lessons from velib , and that autolib system will be much harder to defraud or steal from .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.08.2010 will germans ever embrace pay-tv ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't convinced they should pay more for television pay-tv operator sky deutschland announced it will raise 340 million euros in new capital as profits remain out of reach .
consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

the club claims robben should not have played for his country after picking up an injury bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said he was angry that his club would suffer the consequences of an injury picked up at the world cup by arjen robben .
" we are n't only disappointed , we are very annoyed , " rummenigge told the german daily newspaper muenchner merkur .
" once again we have to pay for a player that we handed over to someone else .
i have asked fifa to mediate in the matter . "
bayern said that a routine pre-season exam showed that the winger had a torn muscle in his left thigh , having suffered the injury shortly before the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge welcomed robben to the club last summer the 26-year-old missed the first two group matches for his country at the tournament in south africa , but played in the remaining five - helping the netherlands to reach the final where they lost 1-0 to spain .
" we are dealing with a serious injury , " said bayern club doctor hans wilhelm mueller-wohlfahrt .
" in my opinion , it was irresponsible that the injury was not better diagnosed and that arjen was allowed to play . "
strongly-worded condemnation the club had initially issued a strongly-worded statement blaming the dutch on its website , before replacing it with a more moderate version .
robben himself expressed shock at the results of the scan and surprise at the length of his forced break .
the former chelsea and real madrid player joined louis van gaal 's side early last season , helping bayern to clinch a bundesliga and german cup double and a place in the champions league final .

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

the club claims robben should not have played for his country after picking up an injury bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said he was angry that his club would suffer the consequences of an injury picked up at the world cup by arjen robben .
" we are n't only disappointed , we are very annoyed , " rummenigge told the german daily newspaper muenchner merkur .
" once again we have to pay for a player that we handed over to someone else .
i have asked fifa to mediate in the matter . "
bayern said that a routine pre-season exam showed that the winger had a torn muscle in his left thigh , having suffered the injury shortly before the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge welcomed robben to the club last summer the 26-year-old missed the first two group matches for his country at the tournament in south africa , but played in the remaining five - helping the netherlands to reach the final where they lost 1-0 to spain .
" we are dealing with a serious injury , " said bayern club doctor hans wilhelm mueller-wohlfahrt .
" in my opinion , it was irresponsible that the injury was not better diagnosed and that arjen was allowed to play . "
strongly-worded condemnation the club had initially issued a strongly-worded statement blaming the dutch on its website , before replacing it with a more moderate version .
robben himself expressed shock at the results of the scan and surprise at the length of his forced break .
the former chelsea and real madrid player joined louis van gaal 's side early last season , helping bayern to clinch a bundesliga and german cup double and a place in the champions league final .

they also have their eyes set on china ’ s growing middle class car buyers .
in germany , a world leader , the reactions have generally been favorable . the sale was done with geely transferring 1.8 billion dollars to ford .
geely group chairman li shufu said it was a " historic day " for the company , which would invest 900 million dollars into improving the brand . geely has nominated the german stefan jacoby , the head of volkswagen in america , as volvo 's new president and chief executive . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a car expert who teaches at duisburg university , said that this was a good decision because jacoby had been instrumental in helping volkswagen expand in china , which has huge potential . he explained that what was needed first of all was to set up " a manufacturing base in china if the company wants to expand .
secondly , it will have to become stronger in the american market .
it will need stronger products and will then gradually make its way across the market but the road will be long .
volvo is struggling today compared to mercedes and bmw . " expanding in the luxury market will take time geely has also said it wants to expand in the luxury market but dudenhoeffer warned that this would not happen overnight .
" it will need a lot of effort and will mean more engineering .
a lot needs to be integrated .
let ’ s see what the situation looks like in 10 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volvo needs to sell 500,000 mid-range models to make its mark in china he added that to compete with other manufacturers in the luxury sector , volvo would first have to improve its sales in mid-range models and reach well beyond the 500,000 mark . the big names in the luxury sector remain mercedes and bmw , which are still in german hands . generally , the reaction in germany to the takeover of volvo by geely has been rather subdued .
some traders said customers had no reason to be concerned . " there ’ s been little negative reaction , of course people are always a bit skeptical at the beginning but if you put forward arguments they see it as a positive development , just as we do .
we have very few negative feelings towards the takeover , " one volvo trader in munich said . volvo will " remain true to its core values " one of the arguments is that the cars are likely to become cheaper ; another is that volvo ’ s hq and plants will remain in europe and that management will retain its autonomy .
moreover , the new owners insist that volvo , which is known for its family-friendly cars , " will remain true to its core values of safety , quality , environmental care and modern design . " bildunterschrift : volvo is renowned for family-friendly cars with high safety standards " it makes no difference for the model i have , " one long-time volvo driver said .
" but i can imagine that in four or five years if we want to buy another car we might ask the question about quality standards .
we ’ ll have to talk with people who know more but of course one can never be certain . " what is certain is that companies all over the world are scrambling to get their share of china ’ s booming car market . author : anne thomas editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.08.2010 will germans ever embrace pay-tv ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't convinced they should pay more for television pay-tv operator sky deutschland announced it will raise 340 million euros in new capital as profits remain out of reach .
consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

a break-away group of former allies abstained in a vote against a junior minister , avoiding a fresh general election for now . the conservative coalition of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has passed its first test in parliament since a damaging defection of members of his party  avoiding any immediate need for a general election .
" we will not go to the polls for now , " said minister for reforms umberto bossi .
supporters of berlusconi 's estranged former political ally gianfranco fini declined to take part in a vote of no-confidence against junior justice minister giacomo caliendo .
the motion , put forward by opposition parties , was defeated in the lower house chamber of deputies with 299 votes against , 229 votes in favor and 75 abstentions .

crucially , this denied berlusconi and his allies a majority in parliament and the premier threatened early elections if provoked by fini .
caliendo is under police investigation for allegedly trying to sell political influence .
fini and his allies avoided a showdown at the ballot box by opting for an abstention .
' sailing without a compass ' however , interior minister roberto maroni - from berlusconi 's main coalition partners the northern league - said that a general election could take place when parliament resumes in september .
maroni said that berlusconi 's two-year-old government was " sailing without a compass " following the split .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections in italy usually take place in the spring " if the ship hits the rocks , we go back to the polls , " maroni told the italian daily newspaper corriere della sera on wednesday .
the minister added that the government might be forced to break with its usual procedure of holding elections in springtime .
" i know there are no precedents for holding elections in the autumn , but that should not be ruled out in the face of a serious political crisis . "
berlusconi is believed to favor early elections if he does not have sufficient backing in parliament .
although the 73-year-old 's coalition has seen its popularity slide recently , the center-left opposition is so fragmented that he could win an early poll .

a break-away group of former allies abstained in a vote against a junior minister , avoiding a fresh general election for now . the conservative coalition of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has passed its first test in parliament since a damaging defection of members of his party  avoiding any immediate need for a general election .

supporters of berlusconi 's estranged former political ally gianfranco fini declined to take part in a vote of no-confidence against junior justice minister giacomo caliendo .

the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .

but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .
those changes include improved public transportation options , heightened restrictions on cars and velib , a bike sharing program that began in 2007 . same perks , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of the bikes in the velib program have been damaged while officials like lepetit hope that autolib can duplicate some of the successes of the bike sharing program , a car sharing venture is also be open to some of the same criticisms . nearly 8,000 of the 20,000 bikes involved in the velib program were either stolen or severely vandalized , especially in the period following velib 's introduction . a car share program also introduces concerns that go beyond vandalism , said bill moore , publisher of ev world , an online magazine about electronic vehicles . " i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .
currently , four bidders are vying to operate autolib , which will be structured as a public-private partnership with the city of paris .
they include avis car rental and the french railway operator sncf . city officials have said they have learned important lessons from velib , and that autolib system will be much harder to defraud or steal from .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.08.2010 will germans ever embrace pay-tv ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't convinced they should pay more for television pay-tv operator sky deutschland announced it will raise 340 million euros in new capital as profits remain out of reach .
consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

but saudi arabia and others are challenging that security with a suspension on blackberry service . saudi arabia is the latest country to announce suspensions in service to blackberry smartphones , citing conflicts between the mobile devices and the country 's communications regulations . saudi arabia 's decision today to cut service to blackberrys starting on august 6 follows a similar announcement made by the united arab emirates on august 1 . the uae plans to end e-mail and internet browsing service for blackberrys starting in october . other countries in the region like egypt and kuwait have also expressed concern about use of the devices , and kuwait successfully lobbied blackberry 's manufacturer to block some 3,000 pornographic sites from being accessed on its phones used in the country . " the decision to ban blackberrys was made after talks between the uae and blackberry 's manufacturer ' research in motion ' failed , " said uae-based journalist abdoullah al-moutawe , in an interview with deutsche welle . " just like in other gulf states , the uae wants access to the encrypted information being sent from here into foreign countries .

" resistance from media , business french ngo reporters without borders has criticized the bans as an attack on press freedom and has drawn attention to the imprisonment of uae residents who organized a protest against gas prices using their blackberrys .

" experts expect to see a 40 percent drop in sales of blackberrys , " al-moutawe said . " that 's why the uae is planning to put a similar device that it made on the market soon . " blackberry bans may spread blackberrys are also encountering resistance in major markets beyond the gulf region . india is also pressuring manufacturer research in motion to gain access to encrypted data exchanged via blackberrys .

robben himself expressed shock at the results of the scan and surprise at the length of his forced break .

i am proud to be male , but at the same time i give due respect to females .
i have crossed three decades of my life but still have no good luck in finding a life partner .
i don ’ t have any hope that my future wife is listening to my profile which you are reading on deutsche welle radio ! ! !
i am not too optimistic , but i am not pessimistic either .
i have worked and am still working hard to make a good number of successes in my life .
i like walking a lot .
i walk on an average 6 kms daily . i cook for myself : breakfast lunch and dinner .
and of course i like my own cooked meal ... too much .
i can cook almost every indian food and try cooking some chinese stuff also .but but but … ..
i am a lacto-ovo-vegetarian and eat no meat and no fish .
i live alone in mumbai - around 2800 kms away from my native place .
mumbai is a very crowded and costly city and it is very difficult to live a decent live here .
now just to change the tone .
i am a mechanical engineer by profession and have changed jobs a couple of times .
i have visited germany twice and have visited france and holland too .
as i am writing this email , i am in the state of texas in the united states of america but will be back in india next week and then i will catch up with dw on my cranky radio .
i guess when i last heard dw my cell was down , so i will be charging it once i am back home .
i like listening to dw in english and hindi - and sometimes in urdu and bengali too .
so i am a multi lingual listener of dw ha ha ha ..
to be specific inbox is a really nice program ... i like it .

i have a little brother called killian and he really likes deutsche welle .
you guys really produce genuine programs and shows and i hope you will present as many programs as possible .
thanks to your show i can stay informed and learn about what is going on in the world .

it was in 1970 when i first wrote to you .
i found the dw advert at the back of scala magazine now the deutschland magazine .
if i look back over the years i will say i am elated and very happy .
in those years gone by , the program schedules first came every two months and in the german language .
eventually hallo friends and yearly calendars were the order of the day .
from cologne to bonn , dw has grown by leaps and bounds . ” wang meng chose to send this message : “ i love dw very much .
i got to know it via livestation.com and find the broadcast both interesting and beneficial .
it has much deeper reports compared with france24 , rfi , etc .
it is also a great source for learning about germany and europe , also to enhance my english .
i am always interested in the german culture , especially in their serious way of doing business , their precision , sophisticated philosophy and classical music .
i would hope you could focus more on china and asia in your english program , so i could view my own country from a german / european perspective .

but saudi arabia and others are challenging that security with a suspension on blackberry service . saudi arabia is the latest country to announce suspensions in service to blackberry smartphones , citing conflicts between the mobile devices and the country 's communications regulations . saudi arabia 's decision today to cut service to blackberrys starting on august 6 follows a similar announcement made by the united arab emirates on august 1 . the uae plans to end e-mail and internet browsing service for blackberrys starting in october . other countries in the region like egypt and kuwait have also expressed concern about use of the devices , and kuwait successfully lobbied blackberry 's manufacturer to block some 3,000 pornographic sites from being accessed on its phones used in the country . " the decision to ban blackberrys was made after talks between the uae and blackberry 's manufacturer ' research in motion ' failed , " said uae-based journalist abdoullah al-moutawe , in an interview with deutsche welle . " just like in other gulf states , the uae wants access to the encrypted information being sent from here into foreign countries .
the usa and great britain have that right , so why should n't we ? " resistance from media , business french ngo reporters without borders has criticized the bans as an attack on press freedom and has drawn attention to the imprisonment of uae residents who organized a protest against gas prices using their blackberrys . " blackberrys are generally used in the gulf region to trade information on social and economic topics , " said gilles lordet , reporters without borders spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle . " blackberrys pose no national security threat in our estimation .
rather , the governments in the gulf region are unaccustomed to dealing with criticism , like in the recent case of gas price protests in the uae . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackberry phones are a staple in dubai 's business world the uae has around 500,000 blackberry subscribers - including many journalists who work for major media outlets in dubai like cnn and al-arabia . saudi arabia currently hosts 700,000 subscriptions . resistance to the bans is expected not only from the media but also from major businesses , many of whom have come to rely on blackberrys as an indispensible business tool . " experts expect to see a 40 percent drop in sales of blackberrys , " al-moutawe said . " that 's why the uae is planning to put a similar device that it made on the market soon . " blackberry bans may spread blackberrys are also encountering resistance in major markets beyond the gulf region . india is also pressuring manufacturer research in motion to gain access to encrypted data exchanged via blackberrys .
the country has not yet announced a ban on services , though , although the economic times cited an anonymous indian official on wednesday as saying the country will consider banning mobile services that can not be monitored . rim has expressed resistance to opening up its networks to surveillance by indian authorities . " we wo n't compromise on the security architecture of our corporate e-mails , " said rim 's india spokesman satchit gayakwad , in an interview with the associated press . we respect the requirements of regulatory bodies in terms of security , but we also look at the customer 's need for privacy . " while india and gulf countries have framed their concerns about blackberrys as national security issues , gilles lordet of reporters without borders , sees a broader conflict at stake . " in the gulf region , there is fundamental tension between the state and the citizens when it comes to freedom of opinion .
as soon as the citizens try to improve their ability to communicate freely with new technologies , government agencies step in to find ways to restrict them , " he said . author : hicham drioiuch -lrb- gsw / ap -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.08.2010 will germans ever embrace pay-tv ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't convinced they should pay more for television pay-tv operator sky deutschland announced it will raise 340 million euros in new capital as profits remain out of reach .
consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .

it came as a surprise to some that a story about shit became an international hit . it 's all just a load of shit - there 's really no other way to put it .
and shit is something author werner holzwarth has thought a lot about . " at that time , in the mid-1980s , my son was maybe three or four years old , we were going for a walk in the park in frankfurt , " holzwarth said .
" he noticed all of the dog droppings and wanted to play with them .
and i thought , to keep him away from them , i 'll buy him a book . " while shitty books abound , there was no book about shit available in german , so holzwarth wrote his own . the simple plot unfolds over 20 pages with large pictures .
one day , a mole comes out of his hole and - plop ! - something lands on his head .
naturally , he is disgusted . but instead of washing his head , the mole decides to get to the bottom of it and find out exactly who was responsible for the rather stinky and unpleasant mishap .
he goes from animal to animal , comparing their patties , droppings and poop to the pile on his head .
whether pigeon , horse , pig or goat - no one seems to be the culprit . still , the mole remains persistent . " he 's my kind of character , " said holzwarth .
" he does n't accept just any answer . " bildunterschrift : the little mole goes from animal to animal , asking who pooped on his head he who seeks shall find the book 's universal theme went over well .
since it came out in 1989 , 1.2 million copies of the german version have been sold .
but it 's also been translated into 33 languages .
whether in china , bolivia , saudi arabia or iceland - everyone knows the stubborn little mole . holzwarth said he is amazed at the reception his book has received . " in the beginning , everyone thought it was gross , " he said .
" the topic was taboo .
what grandma is going to buy her grandchild a book about shit ? " the author spent two years trying to sell his story to a publishing house , but no one was interested .
some called it " unappetizing " or said it was too alternative and reeked of 1968 . but instead of giving up , holzwarth remained as unrelenting as the mole he had created and went in search of an illustrator .
he found wolf erlbruch , who he had met while working in the advertising industry .
finally , a small publishing house - the peter hammer verlag - agreed to publish the experimental work . for erlbruch , it meant the beginning of a successful international career as an illustrator . " it filled a market niche , " said holzwarth . bildunterschrift : obviously , it was n't the cow an eye for an eye now over 20 years old , the little mole - who still remains nameless - has taken on many forms .
in addition to the traditional children 's book , the story has also been performed as a musical and recorded as an audio book . " the most beautiful version of the mole is the french edition for the blind , " commented holzwarth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner holzwarth was inspired to write about shit by his son the persistent mole , of course , discovers the poop perpetrator : it was the butcher 's dog hans-heinerich . and the mole promptly gets his revenge . " the dog wakes up and notices that there is something on his head and ca n't let it rest , " explained holzwarth .

a break-away group of former allies abstained in a vote against a junior minister , avoiding a fresh general election for now . the conservative coalition of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has passed its first test in parliament since a damaging defection of members of his party  avoiding any immediate need for a general election .
" we will not go to the polls for now , " said minister for reforms umberto bossi .
supporters of berlusconi 's estranged former political ally gianfranco fini declined to take part in a vote of no-confidence against junior justice minister giacomo caliendo .
the motion , put forward by opposition parties , was defeated in the lower house chamber of deputies with 299 votes against , 229 votes in favor and 75 abstentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister maroni said elections in september were possible berlusconi had moved to expel fini from the center-right people of freedom party last week .
fini left - but took 33 other parliamentarians with him to join the new future and freedom party .
crucially , this denied berlusconi and his allies a majority in parliament and the premier threatened early elections if provoked by fini .
caliendo is under police investigation for allegedly trying to sell political influence .
fini and his allies avoided a showdown at the ballot box by opting for an abstention .
' sailing without a compass ' however , interior minister roberto maroni - from berlusconi 's main coalition partners the northern league - said that a general election could take place when parliament resumes in september .
maroni said that berlusconi 's two-year-old government was " sailing without a compass " following the split .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections in italy usually take place in the spring " if the ship hits the rocks , we go back to the polls , " maroni told the italian daily newspaper corriere della sera on wednesday .
the minister added that the government might be forced to break with its usual procedure of holding elections in springtime .
" i know there are no precedents for holding elections in the autumn , but that should not be ruled out in the face of a serious political crisis . "
berlusconi is believed to favor early elections if he does not have sufficient backing in parliament .
although the 73-year-old 's coalition has seen its popularity slide recently , the center-left opposition is so fragmented that he could win an early poll .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 04.08.2010 global wheat prices soar as russia cuts crop forecast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia could halve grain exports in 2010 facing severe drought and rampaging wildfires , russia has dropped its grain crop forecast for 2010 .
the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

the spill is now the largest in history , but experts are expected to show that its impact will be less than some feared . following eight hours of pumping mud into its blown oil well , bp announced on wednesday that the well has reached a static condition .
the company began the pumping operation known as a " static kill " on tuesday . a static condition signals a state where pressure from the mud stops the leak by offsetting pressure in the reservoir that causes the oil to shoot to the surface .
tuesday 's maneuver was an alternative to the company 's failed attempt to install a valve over the well to stem the gushing oil . " a static situation basically means you can have just fluid in the hole , and you do n't need to have a valve shut at the surface to have the well killed , " said bp senior vice president kent wells at a press conference on tuesday . the company 's next and final step in killing the well involves pumping cement into the site .
in the coming days , the company will monitor the well in order to decide whether to begin pumping cement immediately or wait until mid-august when drilling on the first relief well is expected to be completed . the " static kill " would take 33 to 61 hours to complete , officials said before wednesday 's announcement . not until cement has been successfully pumped in and the relief wells are finished can the well be considered fully closed , according to us coast guard admiral thad allen , who has headed the government 's response to the spill . not regular mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drilling mud has a thick , pasty consistency in this bp image capture unlike regular mud , the mud pumped into the well is itself a feat of engineering . " the mud is a very complex fluid that was assembled by experts in a laboratory , " said matthias reich , director of the institute for drilling procedure and liquid mining at the technical university of mining in freiberg .
" it has a pasty consistency and , in this case , is very heavy . " the drilling mud was used in multiple tests that paved the way for tuesday 's static kill operation . less damage than initially feared the deepwater horizon oil spill now ranks as the biggest marine spill in history will an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil -lrb- around 200 million gallons , 757 million liters -rrb- released into the gulf of mexico since the rig 's explosion on april 22 .
the spill is followed by 1979 's ixtoc-1 , also in the gulf of mexico , in which around 3.3 million barrels of oil erupted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deepwater horizon spill now ranks as the largest in history nevertheless , a us government report is expected to be revealed later on wednesday with data that shows the impact of the spill is far less than feared . the national oceanic and atmospheric administration is the leading agency responsible for the report that is expected to claim that just 26 percent of the oil that erupted from the site exists in an environmentally dangerous form . the report is also expected to show that sizable quantities of the oil have evaporated at the water surface or have otherwise dissolved into the water with limited ecological consequences . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa , reuters , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 04.08.2010 global wheat prices soar as russia cuts crop forecast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia could halve grain exports in 2010 facing severe drought and rampaging wildfires , russia has dropped its grain crop forecast for 2010 .
the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .
those changes include improved public transportation options , heightened restrictions on cars and velib , a bike sharing program that began in 2007 . same perks , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of the bikes in the velib program have been damaged while officials like lepetit hope that autolib can duplicate some of the successes of the bike sharing program , a car sharing venture is also be open to some of the same criticisms . nearly 8,000 of the 20,000 bikes involved in the velib program were either stolen or severely vandalized , especially in the period following velib 's introduction . a car share program also introduces concerns that go beyond vandalism , said bill moore , publisher of ev world , an online magazine about electronic vehicles . " i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .
currently , four bidders are vying to operate autolib , which will be structured as a public-private partnership with the city of paris .
they include avis car rental and the french railway operator sncf . city officials have said they have learned important lessons from velib , and that autolib system will be much harder to defraud or steal from .
but supporters and skeptics agree that the program also depends on being embraced by everyone in society - including the disgruntled youths who have been known to burn cars . author : eleanor beardsley -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit .

the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 04.08.2010 global wheat prices soar as russia cuts crop forecast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia could halve grain exports in 2010 facing severe drought and rampaging wildfires , russia has dropped its grain crop forecast for 2010 .
the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia does not plan to curb exports for the time being russia insisted tuesday it did not plan to curb exports and tighten the global supply , fears of which sent wheat prices in the us to a two-year high on monday .
" at present -lsb- export restrictions -rsb- will not be introduced , " deputy agriculture minister alexander belyayev told the ria novosti news agency .
" the government takes such decisions , but as of today there is no need for that .
" exports are very easy to lose and very hard to win , " he added .
" we will try to balance things and preserve our market as much as possible . "
no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

they also have their eyes set on china ’ s growing middle class car buyers .
in germany , a world leader , the reactions have generally been favorable . the sale was done with geely transferring 1.8 billion dollars to ford .
geely group chairman li shufu said it was a " historic day " for the company , which would invest 900 million dollars into improving the brand . geely has nominated the german stefan jacoby , the head of volkswagen in america , as volvo 's new president and chief executive . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a car expert who teaches at duisburg university , said that this was a good decision because jacoby had been instrumental in helping volkswagen expand in china , which has huge potential . he explained that what was needed first of all was to set up " a manufacturing base in china if the company wants to expand .
secondly , it will have to become stronger in the american market .
it will need stronger products and will then gradually make its way across the market but the road will be long .
volvo is struggling today compared to mercedes and bmw . " expanding in the luxury market will take time geely has also said it wants to expand in the luxury market but dudenhoeffer warned that this would not happen overnight .

some traders said customers had no reason to be concerned . " there ’ s been little negative reaction , of course people are always a bit skeptical at the beginning but if you put forward arguments they see it as a positive development , just as we do .
we have very few negative feelings towards the takeover , " one volvo trader in munich said . volvo will " remain true to its core values " one of the arguments is that the cars are likely to become cheaper ; another is that volvo ’ s hq and plants will remain in europe and that management will retain its autonomy .
moreover , the new owners insist that volvo , which is known for its family-friendly cars , " will remain true to its core values of safety , quality , environmental care and modern design . " bildunterschrift : volvo is renowned for family-friendly cars with high safety standards " it makes no difference for the model i have , " one long-time volvo driver said .
" but i can imagine that in four or five years if we want to buy another car we might ask the question about quality standards .
we ’ ll have to talk with people who know more but of course one can never be certain .

they also have their eyes set on china ’ s growing middle class car buyers .
in germany , a world leader , the reactions have generally been favorable . the sale was done with geely transferring 1.8 billion dollars to ford .
geely group chairman li shufu said it was a " historic day " for the company , which would invest 900 million dollars into improving the brand . geely has nominated the german stefan jacoby , the head of volkswagen in america , as volvo 's new president and chief executive . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a car expert who teaches at duisburg university , said that this was a good decision because jacoby had been instrumental in helping volkswagen expand in china , which has huge potential . he explained that what was needed first of all was to set up " a manufacturing base in china if the company wants to expand .
secondly , it will have to become stronger in the american market .
it will need stronger products and will then gradually make its way across the market but the road will be long .
volvo is struggling today compared to mercedes and bmw . " expanding in the luxury market will take time geely has also said it wants to expand in the luxury market but dudenhoeffer warned that this would not happen overnight .
" it will need a lot of effort and will mean more engineering .
a lot needs to be integrated .
let ’ s see what the situation looks like in 10 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volvo needs to sell 500,000 mid-range models to make its mark in china he added that to compete with other manufacturers in the luxury sector , volvo would first have to improve its sales in mid-range models and reach well beyond the 500,000 mark . the big names in the luxury sector remain mercedes and bmw , which are still in german hands . generally , the reaction in germany to the takeover of volvo by geely has been rather subdued .
some traders said customers had no reason to be concerned . " there ’ s been little negative reaction , of course people are always a bit skeptical at the beginning but if you put forward arguments they see it as a positive development , just as we do .
we have very few negative feelings towards the takeover , " one volvo trader in munich said . volvo will " remain true to its core values " one of the arguments is that the cars are likely to become cheaper ; another is that volvo ’ s hq and plants will remain in europe and that management will retain its autonomy .
moreover , the new owners insist that volvo , which is known for its family-friendly cars , " will remain true to its core values of safety , quality , environmental care and modern design . " bildunterschrift : volvo is renowned for family-friendly cars with high safety standards " it makes no difference for the model i have , " one long-time volvo driver said .
" but i can imagine that in four or five years if we want to buy another car we might ask the question about quality standards .
we ’ ll have to talk with people who know more but of course one can never be certain . " what is certain is that companies all over the world are scrambling to get their share of china ’ s booming car market . author : anne thomas editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my opinion , it was irresponsible that the injury was not better diagnosed and that arjen was allowed to play . "

robben himself expressed shock at the results of the scan and surprise at the length of his forced break .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 04.08.2010 paris plans to launch electric car sharing program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electric cars may become a standard sight on paris ' streets paris may soon add hosting the world 's largest electric car sharing program to its list of green accolades .
but officials will have to account for the same problems the city 's bike sharing scheme faces . paris has announced plans to introduce an electric car sharing program called autolib .
the city is starting with a fleet of 3,000 cars available for rent coupled with up to 1,000 battery recharging stations throughout the french capital . the program will help many parisians get rid of the cars they have while saving much of the estimated 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,200 -rrb- that it costs an average owner to keep a car in the city , according to paris ' deputy mayor annick lepetit . " there are many people who absolutely need a car , and with autolib , they 'll have one , " said lepetit .
" the advantage will be that it will be a lot cheaper and less of a hassle , because they 'll be able to pick it up from one place and turn it in anywhere else in the city without looking for parking . " the car sharing proposal follows changes to the city 's transportation policies within the last 10 years that have ushered in a 25 percent drop in traffic in paris .
those changes include improved public transportation options , heightened restrictions on cars and velib , a bike sharing program that began in 2007 . same perks , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly half of the bikes in the velib program have been damaged while officials like lepetit hope that autolib can duplicate some of the successes of the bike sharing program , a car sharing venture is also be open to some of the same criticisms . nearly 8,000 of the 20,000 bikes involved in the velib program were either stolen or severely vandalized , especially in the period following velib 's introduction . a car share program also introduces concerns that go beyond vandalism , said bill moore , publisher of ev world , an online magazine about electronic vehicles . " i think the last thing that anyone wants to see is these vehicles stalled along various paris motorways or out in the suburbs and having to be towed to a place to get recharged , " he said . nevertheless , moore said he believes electric car technology is ready for prime time and believes the autolib program could be a model for other cities , provided it avoids the big pitfalls . parisians " not civilized enough " carol levy is a mother living in paris and shares moore 's attitude .
she said people with children in paris need to have cars and thinks the program is a good idea in theory , but that parisians may pose a roadblock . " keeping the velib and autolib materials in good shape seems to be a real problem , " levy said .
" i just do n't think parisians are civilized enough to do so - or maybe we french just lack a civic sense . " the success of the program will depend partly on how it is administered and by whom .

umarov said the situation in the region made it impossible for him to relinquish control . chechen rebel chief doku umarov has reversed a decision to step down , days after he announced he was renouncing control of his rebel islamist movement .
umarov , the self-styled " emir of the caucasus , " announced his intentions in a video posted on the website you tube on wednesday .

he said in a video posted on monday he had grown tired and would step aside for younger militant successor aslambek vadalov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.08.2010 will germans ever embrace pay-tv ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't convinced they should pay more for television pay-tv operator sky deutschland announced it will raise 340 million euros in new capital as profits remain out of reach .
consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have had a wide choice of free programming for years " changing the name from premiere to sky deutschland might have not been the best move , " said ralf siepmann , a media analyst and head of logemedia , told deutsche welle .
" and the company has yet to convince people that a subscription is actually worth it . "
he cites the example of the recent football world cup , where germans could watch all the games on free-to-air channels .
" where 's the advantage of paying for that same pleasure ? " he said .
football , or soccer to the americans , has always been an important pay-tv driver .
but when premiere turned into sky deutschland , people who just wanted to watch the german bundesliga could no longer sign up for that privilege alone - they had to buy the basic entertainment package with an extra football package added on top of it .
" it was unattractive from a client 's perspective , " said analyst birkel .
" it meant average revenue per user went up slightly , but it 's gotten harder to get new people on board . "
new priorities if sky deutschland does not sign up appreciable numbers , it is hard to see how much longer it can hold out in germany .
but , if the company falls short of its 340-million target in the share sale , news corp. will lend it the rest of the money , indicating it still thinks the dire situation in germany can be salvaged .
last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

consumers in germany have not embraced pay-tv as they have in the uk and france . sky deutschland plans to raise 340 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in fresh cash in its seventh share sale since 2005 as the troubled broadcaster continues chasing elusive profits and tries to convince reluctant germans to pay more for television content .
the company , which is based near munich and 45.4 percent-owned by rupert murdoch 's news corp. , also issued a profit warning , saying its full-year 2010 loss before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization would be " significantly " greater than previous estimates of 130-170 million euros .
the company blamed " slower than expected subscriber development and increased investment in key initiatives . "
it predicted that while its earnings in 2011 would be higher than in 2010 , the company would still be in the red .
no new breakeven target was announced .
the announcement is the latest indicator that pay-tv in germany has not lived up to the potential that its backers once thought it had .
many dreamed of easily tapping europe 's largest television market - over 37 million households in germany had a tv set at the end of 2008 - and pay-tv had proven wildly successful in france and the uk .
free tradition but pay-tv 's subscription rates in germany are stagnant .
sky deutschland is stuck at around 2.4 million subscribers , but it needs near 3 million to make money .
analysts say while not impossible , getting more german subscribers on board is a hard task .
" germany has a long tradition of having a very broad spectrum of free television channels , " jo groebel , media analyst and director of the german digital institute in berlin , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert murdoch continues to invest in the reluctant german market " when it comes to tv , germans almost regard it as a natural right to have free content , " he said .
the mentality is different in france and the uk , where around 42 percent and 47 percent of households respectively pay for extra tv services similar to sky deutschland .
in germany , that number is closer to 10 percent .
that has to do with history , according to mathias birkel , a senior consultant at goldmedia .
while in the not-too-distant past , french and british tv viewers were limited to four or five free channels , germans have long been able to choose from around 20 .
" if the french or british wanted more , they had to pay .
germans never did , " birkel told deutsche welle .
today , around 90 percent of german households have cable or satellite tv and viewers have access to a mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels .
germans do pay a license fee that finances public broadcasters , but shelling out more for premium channels appears to run firmly against the teutonic grain .
troubled history life in the red is nothing new to sky deutschland , which was known under the premiere brand name until last year .
since its initial public offering in 2005 , the company has hardly ended a quarter in positive territory .
germans ' reluctance to pay for content has made the game hard , but so have some decisions on the part of the company .

last year , when premiere changed its name , then-chief executive mark williams said : " i am very excited to announce our plans to create a new pay-tv service .
we intend to make changes that will fundamentally improve the experience for customers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pay-tv has lost money for years and profits still seem far off one year later , he is no longer in that position .
brian sullivan , who took over the reins in april , is now the one charged with keeping the company from drowning in a sea of red ink .
there is a lot at stake , especially given that news corp. is estimated to have pumped at least 750 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- into german pay-tv .
sullivan has said he is putting the customer first , and taking the emphasis off extra choice , since germans already have plenty of choice in the first place .
he said sky deutschland will now emphasize the " highest-quality content and viewing experience . "
the proceeds of the capital increase will be used to expand its high-definition broadcasts , launch new services and distribution initiatives as well as improve customer service , the company said . too little , too late ?
some say sky deutschland might have already missed the boat , however , and that the age of classic pay-tv is past , since the future of paid content could well be online .
sky 's main competitor in the german market is telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , which offers a subscriber-based iptv service that has almost half the number of subscribers sky does .
it also has the advantage of being able to bundle telephony , high-speed internet and tv services in one package .
" the future could belong to on-demand services , especially if people want to download one or two movies a month instead of paying for a subscription , " birkel said .
but others say pay-tv could still be a player , depending on how the sector presents itself and its products .
in the us , cable operators like hbo and showtime have enjoyed success thanks to the high-quality dramas they have produced , such as the sopranos .
the germans have not gone down that road yet , largely due to budget constraints , but it could be a model worth looking into , according to siepmann .
he also compares the situation to the discussion about newspapers and the internet and the debate over paying for quality media products online .
if pay-tv can offer a superior product , such as original programming or high-definition pictures , people might be more willing to open their wallets .
" this mentality of getting it all for free might subside somewhat , " he said , " which would be very good news for sky . "

the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .
russia 's agriculture ministry on tuesday cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 70-75 million tons , down from a previous forecast of just under 85 million tons .
the russian grain union was also less than optimistic , dropping its projection by about 10 million to 72-78 million tons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher wheat prices could result in more expensive bread worldwide according to some analysts , the world 's number three wheat exporter may harvest less than 70 million tons in 2010 , which could halve grain exports to 12 million tons .
in 2009 , russia harvested a healthy 97 million tons and exported 21.4 million .
exporters risk defaulting russia 's international grain company on tuesday went even further , saying that the 2010 crop could fall to as little as 65 million tons , adding that if the government does n't impose an outright ban on grain exports for about a month from september , wheat exports could fall to 5-8 million tons .
exporters also risk defaulting on shipments of up to 1 million tons .
in may and june , black sea feed wheat was going for around $ 190- $ 200 -lrb- 144-151 euros -rrb- a ton , including cost and freight .
that price has now soared to as much as $ 260 .
agricultural analysts from sovecon told the reuters news agency on monday that traders were having trouble finding grain to ship , as farmers become unwilling to sell at previously agreed prices .
" it appears that traders who had actively signed supply contracts at the start of the season are now honoring them at a loss or with a minimal margin , " said andrei sizov jr . , sovecon 's executive director .
on tuesday , traders in singapore said exporters had delayed up to 200,000 tons of black sea wheat shipments to asia .
deliveries originally scheduled for july had been pushed back to august and september .
the united grain company , russia 's state grain trader , on monday denied defaulting on a 60,000-ton shipment to egypt , one of the world 's leading importers of wheat .

no end in sight meanwhile , states of emergencies due to the drought and wildfires have been declared in 27 regions in central and southern russia , up from 23 last week .
the country 's hydrometeorological center said tuesday that it expected temperatures of 36-42 degrees celsius -lrb- 96.8-107.6 fahrenheit -rrb- to continue until at least sunday .
the drought , which has ravaged the wheat harvest in a region stretching from romania to siberia , has also put sowing for next year 's crop at risk .

the move has sent wheat prices to a two-year high . as russia continues to suffer through its worst drought in 130 years , officials said tuesday that the extreme heat and wildfires had by the end of july scorched grain crops on 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- , an area roughly the size of portugal .
expectations that russia will slash exports , in addition to low yields expected in the equally drought-stricken ukraine and kazakhstan and a low harvest in canada , have led to a spike in global wheat prices and could , down the line , result in an increase in the cost of bread worldwide , especially in the middle east , africa and parts of asia .
" wheat prices have seen the largest one-month jump in more than three decades on the back of a severe drought in russia , prompting warnings by the food industry of rising prices for flour-related products , " analysts at barclays capital said in a note .
" there are fears that russia , ukraine and kazakhstan 's export production could drop by as much as 27 percent for 2010 and 2011 , " said michael hewson , an analyst at financial derivatives dealer cmc markets .
he added that the drought and wildfires in russia had " prompted speculative buying " in the wheat market .

the spill is now the largest in history , but experts are expected to show that its impact will be less than some feared . following eight hours of pumping mud into its blown oil well , bp announced on wednesday that the well has reached a static condition .
the company began the pumping operation known as a " static kill " on tuesday . a static condition signals a state where pressure from the mud stops the leak by offsetting pressure in the reservoir that causes the oil to shoot to the surface .
tuesday 's maneuver was an alternative to the company 's failed attempt to install a valve over the well to stem the gushing oil . " a static situation basically means you can have just fluid in the hole , and you do n't need to have a valve shut at the surface to have the well killed , " said bp senior vice president kent wells at a press conference on tuesday . the company 's next and final step in killing the well involves pumping cement into the site .
in the coming days , the company will monitor the well in order to decide whether to begin pumping cement immediately or wait until mid-august when drilling on the first relief well is expected to be completed . the " static kill " would take 33 to 61 hours to complete , officials said before wednesday 's announcement . not until cement has been successfully pumped in and the relief wells are finished can the well be considered fully closed , according to us coast guard admiral thad allen , who has headed the government 's response to the spill . not regular mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drilling mud has a thick , pasty consistency in this bp image capture unlike regular mud , the mud pumped into the well is itself a feat of engineering . " the mud is a very complex fluid that was assembled by experts in a laboratory , " said matthias reich , director of the institute for drilling procedure and liquid mining at the technical university of mining in freiberg .
" it has a pasty consistency and , in this case , is very heavy . " the drilling mud was used in multiple tests that paved the way for tuesday 's static kill operation . less damage than initially feared the deepwater horizon oil spill now ranks as the biggest marine spill in history will an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil -lrb- around 200 million gallons , 757 million liters -rrb- released into the gulf of mexico since the rig 's explosion on april 22 .
the spill is followed by 1979 's ixtoc-1 , also in the gulf of mexico , in which around 3.3 million barrels of oil erupted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deepwater horizon spill now ranks as the largest in history nevertheless , a us government report is expected to be revealed later on wednesday with data that shows the impact of the spill is far less than feared . the national oceanic and atmospheric administration is the leading agency responsible for the report that is expected to claim that just 26 percent of the oil that erupted from the site exists in an environmentally dangerous form . the report is also expected to show that sizable quantities of the oil have evaporated at the water surface or have otherwise dissolved into the water with limited ecological consequences . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa , reuters , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also have their eyes set on china ’ s growing middle class car buyers .
in germany , a world leader , the reactions have generally been favorable . the sale was done with geely transferring 1.8 billion dollars to ford .
geely group chairman li shufu said it was a " historic day " for the company , which would invest 900 million dollars into improving the brand . geely has nominated the german stefan jacoby , the head of volkswagen in america , as volvo 's new president and chief executive . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a car expert who teaches at duisburg university , said that this was a good decision because jacoby had been instrumental in helping volkswagen expand in china , which has huge potential . he explained that what was needed first of all was to set up " a manufacturing base in china if the company wants to expand .
secondly , it will have to become stronger in the american market .
it will need stronger products and will then gradually make its way across the market but the road will be long .

we have very few negative feelings towards the takeover , " one volvo trader in munich said . volvo will " remain true to its core values " one of the arguments is that the cars are likely to become cheaper ; another is that volvo ’ s hq and plants will remain in europe and that management will retain its autonomy .
moreover , the new owners insist that volvo , which is known for its family-friendly cars , " will remain true to its core values of safety , quality , environmental care and modern design . " bildunterschrift : volvo is renowned for family-friendly cars with high safety standards " it makes no difference for the model i have , " one long-time volvo driver said .

it came as a surprise to some that a story about shit became an international hit . it 's all just a load of shit - there 's really no other way to put it .
and shit is something author werner holzwarth has thought a lot about . " at that time , in the mid-1980s , my son was maybe three or four years old , we were going for a walk in the park in frankfurt , " holzwarth said .
" he noticed all of the dog droppings and wanted to play with them .
and i thought , to keep him away from them , i 'll buy him a book . " while shitty books abound , there was no book about shit available in german , so holzwarth wrote his own . the simple plot unfolds over 20 pages with large pictures .
one day , a mole comes out of his hole and - plop ! - something lands on his head .
naturally , he is disgusted . but instead of washing his head , the mole decides to get to the bottom of it and find out exactly who was responsible for the rather stinky and unpleasant mishap .
he goes from animal to animal , comparing their patties , droppings and poop to the pile on his head .
whether pigeon , horse , pig or goat - no one seems to be the culprit . still , the mole remains persistent . " he 's my kind of character , " said holzwarth .
" he does n't accept just any answer . " bildunterschrift : the little mole goes from animal to animal , asking who pooped on his head he who seeks shall find the book 's universal theme went over well .
since it came out in 1989 , 1.2 million copies of the german version have been sold .
but it 's also been translated into 33 languages .
whether in china , bolivia , saudi arabia or iceland - everyone knows the stubborn little mole . holzwarth said he is amazed at the reception his book has received . " in the beginning , everyone thought it was gross , " he said .
" the topic was taboo .
what grandma is going to buy her grandchild a book about shit ? " the author spent two years trying to sell his story to a publishing house , but no one was interested .
some called it " unappetizing " or said it was too alternative and reeked of 1968 . but instead of giving up , holzwarth remained as unrelenting as the mole he had created and went in search of an illustrator .
he found wolf erlbruch , who he had met while working in the advertising industry .
finally , a small publishing house - the peter hammer verlag - agreed to publish the experimental work . for erlbruch , it meant the beginning of a successful international career as an illustrator . " it filled a market niche , " said holzwarth . bildunterschrift : obviously , it was n't the cow an eye for an eye now over 20 years old , the little mole - who still remains nameless - has taken on many forms .
in addition to the traditional children 's book , the story has also been performed as a musical and recorded as an audio book . " the most beautiful version of the mole is the french edition for the blind , " commented holzwarth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner holzwarth was inspired to write about shit by his son the persistent mole , of course , discovers the poop perpetrator : it was the butcher 's dog hans-heinerich . and the mole promptly gets his revenge .

it came as a surprise to some that a story about shit became an international hit . it 's all just a load of shit - there 's really no other way to put it .
and shit is something author werner holzwarth has thought a lot about . " at that time , in the mid-1980s , my son was maybe three or four years old , we were going for a walk in the park in frankfurt , " holzwarth said .
" he noticed all of the dog droppings and wanted to play with them .
and i thought , to keep him away from them , i 'll buy him a book . " while shitty books abound , there was no book about shit available in german , so holzwarth wrote his own . the simple plot unfolds over 20 pages with large pictures .
one day , a mole comes out of his hole and - plop ! - something lands on his head .
naturally , he is disgusted . but instead of washing his head , the mole decides to get to the bottom of it and find out exactly who was responsible for the rather stinky and unpleasant mishap .
he goes from animal to animal , comparing their patties , droppings and poop to the pile on his head .
whether pigeon , horse , pig or goat - no one seems to be the culprit . still , the mole remains persistent . " he 's my kind of character , " said holzwarth .
" he does n't accept just any answer . " bildunterschrift : the little mole goes from animal to animal , asking who pooped on his head he who seeks shall find the book 's universal theme went over well .
since it came out in 1989 , 1.2 million copies of the german version have been sold .
but it 's also been translated into 33 languages .
whether in china , bolivia , saudi arabia or iceland - everyone knows the stubborn little mole . holzwarth said he is amazed at the reception his book has received . " in the beginning , everyone thought it was gross , " he said .
" the topic was taboo .
what grandma is going to buy her grandchild a book about shit ? " the author spent two years trying to sell his story to a publishing house , but no one was interested .
some called it " unappetizing " or said it was too alternative and reeked of 1968 . but instead of giving up , holzwarth remained as unrelenting as the mole he had created and went in search of an illustrator .
he found wolf erlbruch , who he had met while working in the advertising industry .
finally , a small publishing house - the peter hammer verlag - agreed to publish the experimental work . for erlbruch , it meant the beginning of a successful international career as an illustrator . " it filled a market niche , " said holzwarth . bildunterschrift : obviously , it was n't the cow an eye for an eye now over 20 years old , the little mole - who still remains nameless - has taken on many forms .
in addition to the traditional children 's book , the story has also been performed as a musical and recorded as an audio book . " the most beautiful version of the mole is the french edition for the blind , " commented holzwarth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner holzwarth was inspired to write about shit by his son the persistent mole , of course , discovers the poop perpetrator : it was the butcher 's dog hans-heinerich . and the mole promptly gets his revenge . " the dog wakes up and notices that there is something on his head and ca n't let it rest , " explained holzwarth .
" it 's clear that he continues " and conducts his own investigation - the perfect opportunity for a sequel . author : stefanie duckstein -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but saudi arabia and others are challenging that security with a suspension on blackberry service . saudi arabia is the latest country to announce suspensions in service to blackberry smartphones , citing conflicts between the mobile devices and the country 's communications regulations . saudi arabia 's decision today to cut service to blackberrys starting on august 6 follows a similar announcement made by the united arab emirates on august 1 . the uae plans to end e-mail and internet browsing service for blackberrys starting in october . other countries in the region like egypt and kuwait have also expressed concern about use of the devices , and kuwait successfully lobbied blackberry 's manufacturer to block some 3,000 pornographic sites from being accessed on its phones used in the country . " the decision to ban blackberrys was made after talks between the uae and blackberry 's manufacturer ' research in motion ' failed , " said uae-based journalist abdoullah al-moutawe , in an interview with deutsche welle . " just like in other gulf states , the uae wants access to the encrypted information being sent from here into foreign countries .
the usa and great britain have that right , so why should n't we ? " resistance from media , business french ngo reporters without borders has criticized the bans as an attack on press freedom and has drawn attention to the imprisonment of uae residents who organized a protest against gas prices using their blackberrys . " blackberrys are generally used in the gulf region to trade information on social and economic topics , " said gilles lordet , reporters without borders spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle . " blackberrys pose no national security threat in our estimation .
rather , the governments in the gulf region are unaccustomed to dealing with criticism , like in the recent case of gas price protests in the uae . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackberry phones are a staple in dubai 's business world the uae has around 500,000 blackberry subscribers - including many journalists who work for major media outlets in dubai like cnn and al-arabia . saudi arabia currently hosts 700,000 subscriptions . resistance to the bans is expected not only from the media but also from major businesses , many of whom have come to rely on blackberrys as an indispensible business tool . " experts expect to see a 40 percent drop in sales of blackberrys , " al-moutawe said . " that 's why the uae is planning to put a similar device that it made on the market soon . " blackberry bans may spread blackberrys are also encountering resistance in major markets beyond the gulf region . india is also pressuring manufacturer research in motion to gain access to encrypted data exchanged via blackberrys .
the country has not yet announced a ban on services , though , although the economic times cited an anonymous indian official on wednesday as saying the country will consider banning mobile services that can not be monitored . rim has expressed resistance to opening up its networks to surveillance by indian authorities . " we wo n't compromise on the security architecture of our corporate e-mails , " said rim 's india spokesman satchit gayakwad , in an interview with the associated press . we respect the requirements of regulatory bodies in terms of security , but we also look at the customer 's need for privacy . " while india and gulf countries have framed their concerns about blackberrys as national security issues , gilles lordet of reporters without borders , sees a broader conflict at stake . " in the gulf region , there is fundamental tension between the state and the citizens when it comes to freedom of opinion .
as soon as the citizens try to improve their ability to communicate freely with new technologies , government agencies step in to find ways to restrict them , " he said . author : hicham drioiuch -lrb- gsw / ap -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a break-away group of former allies abstained in a vote against a junior minister , avoiding a fresh general election for now . the conservative coalition of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has passed its first test in parliament since a damaging defection of members of his party  avoiding any immediate need for a general election .
" we will not go to the polls for now , " said minister for reforms umberto bossi .
supporters of berlusconi 's estranged former political ally gianfranco fini declined to take part in a vote of no-confidence against junior justice minister giacomo caliendo .
the motion , put forward by opposition parties , was defeated in the lower house chamber of deputies with 299 votes against , 229 votes in favor and 75 abstentions .

crucially , this denied berlusconi and his allies a majority in parliament and the premier threatened early elections if provoked by fini .
caliendo is under police investigation for allegedly trying to sell political influence .
fini and his allies avoided a showdown at the ballot box by opting for an abstention .

maroni said that berlusconi 's two-year-old government was " sailing without a compass " following the split .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections in italy usually take place in the spring " if the ship hits the rocks , we go back to the polls , " maroni told the italian daily newspaper corriere della sera on wednesday .
the minister added that the government might be forced to break with its usual procedure of holding elections in springtime .
" i know there are no precedents for holding elections in the autumn , but that should not be ruled out in the face of a serious political crisis . "
berlusconi is believed to favor early elections if he does not have sufficient backing in parliament .
although the 73-year-old 's coalition has seen its popularity slide recently , the center-left opposition is so fragmented that he could win an early poll .

a break-away group of former allies abstained in a vote against a junior minister , avoiding a fresh general election for now . the conservative coalition of italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has passed its first test in parliament since a damaging defection of members of his party  avoiding any immediate need for a general election .
" we will not go to the polls for now , " said minister for reforms umberto bossi .
supporters of berlusconi 's estranged former political ally gianfranco fini declined to take part in a vote of no-confidence against junior justice minister giacomo caliendo .
the motion , put forward by opposition parties , was defeated in the lower house chamber of deputies with 299 votes against , 229 votes in favor and 75 abstentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister maroni said elections in september were possible berlusconi had moved to expel fini from the center-right people of freedom party last week .
fini left - but took 33 other parliamentarians with him to join the new future and freedom party .
crucially , this denied berlusconi and his allies a majority in parliament and the premier threatened early elections if provoked by fini .
caliendo is under police investigation for allegedly trying to sell political influence .
fini and his allies avoided a showdown at the ballot box by opting for an abstention .
' sailing without a compass ' however , interior minister roberto maroni - from berlusconi 's main coalition partners the northern league - said that a general election could take place when parliament resumes in september .
maroni said that berlusconi 's two-year-old government was " sailing without a compass " following the split .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections in italy usually take place in the spring " if the ship hits the rocks , we go back to the polls , " maroni told the italian daily newspaper corriere della sera on wednesday .
the minister added that the government might be forced to break with its usual procedure of holding elections in springtime .
" i know there are no precedents for holding elections in the autumn , but that should not be ruled out in the face of a serious political crisis . "
berlusconi is believed to favor early elections if he does not have sufficient backing in parliament .
although the 73-year-old 's coalition has seen its popularity slide recently , the center-left opposition is so fragmented that he could win an early poll .

i am proud to be male , but at the same time i give due respect to females .

i am a lacto-ovo-vegetarian and eat no meat and no fish .
i live alone in mumbai - around 2800 kms away from my native place .
mumbai is a very crowded and costly city and it is very difficult to live a decent live here .
now just to change the tone .
i am a mechanical engineer by profession and have changed jobs a couple of times .
i have visited germany twice and have visited france and holland too .
as i am writing this email , i am in the state of texas in the united states of america but will be back in india next week and then i will catch up with dw on my cranky radio .

it was in 1970 when i first wrote to you .
i found the dw advert at the back of scala magazine now the deutschland magazine .
if i look back over the years i will say i am elated and very happy .
in those years gone by , the program schedules first came every two months and in the german language .
eventually hallo friends and yearly calendars were the order of the day .
from cologne to bonn , dw has grown by leaps and bounds . ” wang meng chose to send this message : “ i love dw very much .
i got to know it via livestation.com and find the broadcast both interesting and beneficial .

it is also a great source for learning about germany and europe , also to enhance my english .
i am always interested in the german culture , especially in their serious way of doing business , their precision , sophisticated philosophy and classical music .

for this we are ever grateful .
we could not possibly fit all the comments we receive onto our web page but here is a very small selection : here are the long awaited winning inbox profiles for the months of april and may : april 2010 : suman kumar from mumbai , india : “ my name is my name and it 's a good name is n't it ?
i am proud to be male , but at the same time i give due respect to females .
i have crossed three decades of my life but still have no good luck in finding a life partner .
i don ’ t have any hope that my future wife is listening to my profile which you are reading on deutsche welle radio ! ! !
i am not too optimistic , but i am not pessimistic either .
i have worked and am still working hard to make a good number of successes in my life .
i like walking a lot .
i walk on an average 6 kms daily . i cook for myself : breakfast lunch and dinner .
and of course i like my own cooked meal ... too much .
i can cook almost every indian food and try cooking some chinese stuff also .but but but … ..
i am a lacto-ovo-vegetarian and eat no meat and no fish .
i live alone in mumbai - around 2800 kms away from my native place .
mumbai is a very crowded and costly city and it is very difficult to live a decent live here .
now just to change the tone .
i am a mechanical engineer by profession and have changed jobs a couple of times .
i have visited germany twice and have visited france and holland too .
as i am writing this email , i am in the state of texas in the united states of america but will be back in india next week and then i will catch up with dw on my cranky radio .
i guess when i last heard dw my cell was down , so i will be charging it once i am back home .
i like listening to dw in english and hindi - and sometimes in urdu and bengali too .
so i am a multi lingual listener of dw ha ha ha ..
to be specific inbox is a really nice program ... i like it .
i also like living planet and asia compact , too .
by and take care for the time being .
i will catch your signal once i am back home . ” may 2010 yaaqub jaidi in kakamega in kenya . “ i would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your collaborative effort , support and guidance that have led to numerous programs aimed at improving the lot of african people all over the world .
deutsche welle radio and television programs really stimulate me .
deutsche welle rocks me up .
there are many people listening to deutsche welle radio including young kids .
i have a little brother called killian and he really likes deutsche welle .
you guys really produce genuine programs and shows and i hope you will present as many programs as possible .
thanks to your show i can stay informed and learn about what is going on in the world .
no matter how busy my schedules are or how harsh the internet blockade , i watch your tv programs and shows regularly and like it very much . “ congratulations to you both upon having written the chosen profiles for the months of april and may ! the following comments have not won their authors a prize but the inbox team certainly appreciated receiving them and we are pleased to share them with you , our readers !
a friend of ours from uganda , bahati ibrahim , sent us this message : " i hope you are hale and hearty , wish you all the very best indeed !
yeah !
it ’ s a little bit sunny here in uganda and many extra greetings from us here : that ’ s from me and my friends and family .
i am emailing to inform you that i have received the mp3 player . i love it so much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
now you can be sure that i will download all my favourite programs whenever i want - all day and night !
but that does not mean i vacate shortwave – that ’ s been part of me from the start !
love you so much , indeed .
allow me to keep listening and hoping the very best is always to come from the heart of europe in bonn .
many extra thanks indeed ! ” richard baah from asesewa in the eastern region of ghana has been a deutsche welle listener for quite some time and had this to say : “ this year marks my 40 years of correspondence with deutsche welle .
it was in 1970 when i first wrote to you .
i found the dw advert at the back of scala magazine now the deutschland magazine .
if i look back over the years i will say i am elated and very happy .
in those years gone by , the program schedules first came every two months and in the german language .
eventually hallo friends and yearly calendars were the order of the day .
from cologne to bonn , dw has grown by leaps and bounds . ” wang meng chose to send this message : “ i love dw very much .
i got to know it via livestation.com and find the broadcast both interesting and beneficial .
it has much deeper reports compared with france24 , rfi , etc .
it is also a great source for learning about germany and europe , also to enhance my english .
i am always interested in the german culture , especially in their serious way of doing business , their precision , sophisticated philosophy and classical music .
i would hope you could focus more on china and asia in your english program , so i could view my own country from a german / european perspective .
