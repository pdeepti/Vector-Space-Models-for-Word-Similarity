program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.04.2010 german cinemas forced to sharpen focus in 3d age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about what you see , not what you look like while germany enjoys international renown for its generosity to film producers and directors , it has so far done nothing to help its cinemas into the 3d digital age .
and now time is beginning to run out . avatar was always going to be a big deal , but the german cinema landscape was quite unprepared for the mayhem and uncertainty it has left in its wake .
james cameron 's blockbuster came , was seen , and conquered the senses of a new generation of cinema-goers .
the word on the blogs is that 3d rocks and there is no way back .
but keeping pace with audience demands is easier said than done in germany , where cinemas have been rather ponderous in their willingness to embrace the technology it takes to screen the likes of avatar and alice in wonderland in all their three-dimensional glory .
a year ago , just 30 of the nation 's 4,000 plus screens were equipped with the technology necessary to run 3d flicks .
and although that number has now reached somewhere between five and six hundred , there are still a lot of old-school picture houses dotted about the country .
out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avatar was a game-changer as quaint as that scenario might sound , it is potentially very damaging to the cinema industry .
kai bartels , who runs a four-screen cinema in quickborn , a small town just north of hamburg , is all too aware of the need to move with the times .
" we screened avatar as a normal film and everyone who came to buy a ticket wanted to know if it was in 3d and where they could get their glasses , " bartels told deutsche welle .
" we lost out on that film . "
by contrast , the uci chain , which has more than 200 screens nationwide , some 40 of which are now equipped to show movies in 3d , reported a 13 percent increase in attendance levels last year .
spokesman thomas schulke says that surge in business is largely due to 3d films .
" all except one of our number one films this year have been 3d , " he said .
" there is a huge demand , people want a different viewing experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from alice in wonderland schulke believes that this time around , 3d is here to stay , and with companies such as dreamworks dedicating their entire 2010 production slate to three-dimensional pictures , he could well be right .
strapped for cash in the country so why , in that case , are n't there more german cinemas making the transition necessary to secure them a piece of the juicy new pie ?
jasko jochenhoevel , academic assistant at the potsdam film and television academy , says it is simply a question of money .
" a digital projector costs somewhere in the realm of 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 107,000 -rrb- , and then another 30,000 on top to make it 3d compatible , " jochenhoevel said .
“ and a lot of smaller cinemas just ca n't afford it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of small town cinemas ?
and therein lies a potentially devastating problem .
because keeping up with the times is not only about being able to screen the latest 3d releases , it is about becoming digital per se .
cinemas that can only play analogue films will ultimately be nudged out of the listings , whether they run arthouse or more commercial programs .
" digitial is the future , that 's a fact , " bartels said .
" there will come a time when distributors only work with digital copies .
it could be in two or in five years , but that moment will come . "
every cinema for itself when it does , bartels wants to be ready , so has begun looking at ways to make it happen .
essentially that means taking out a loan , because despite good intentions on the part of german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , no money has been made available to ease the path to the far side of the digital divide .
" we 've always been told -lsb- funding -rsb- will come , but it has n't so far and just sitting around waiting is too dangerous in this competitive climate , " bartels said .
the ffa first began drawing up plans for a comprehensive digitalization concept four years ago .
the initial idea was that cinema operators , distributors , film funding bodies and the government would put a total of 280 million euros into a " solidarity fund " from which cinemas nationwide would have been entitled to draw .
but the fund became overshadowed by an ongoing battle between some movie theaters and the ffa over screening fees , and subsequently never made it beyond the planning stages .
bildunterschrift : a larger than life , 3d version of shrek is due to hit the screens this year further efforts to come up with a new concept have also failed , and although a spokesman for the ffa told deutsche welle that there are new ideas in the pipeline , they are still a long way from becoming reality .
" we are all hoping , all waiting , but nobody knows when it -lsb- the fund -rsb- will come , " the spokesman said .
in the meantime , the larger cinemas have taken it upon themselves to go digital , and given their huge seating capacities , the surcharge on 3d tickets and their competitive advantage , they are in a good position .
it stands to reason that they 're not keen to share the new and highly lucrative market with everyone else .
and if a deal can not be struck at some point in the relatively near future , they might not have to . author : tamsin walker editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .

and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

" in our previous matches , our first leg results were not as good and we went through anyway .
i always think we can score away from home , so i think we can go through . "
bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .
" at half-time we said that a goalless draw would be a good result , " he said .
" but when they went a man down we knew that we could get more . "

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.04.2010 why germany 's electoral system would turn the british vote upside down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy has many forms ; germany 's differs from britain 's national elections are approaching in britain , and a big regional ballot follows a few days later in germany , but the results in each country will be reached using different systems of representation . the extremely close race in the british general election is highlighting the differences between that country 's first-past-the-post electoral system , and the model based on proportional representation here in germany .
buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.04.2010 why germany 's electoral system would turn the british vote upside down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy has many forms ; germany 's differs from britain 's national elections are approaching in britain , and a big regional ballot follows a few days later in germany , but the results in each country will be reached using different systems of representation . the extremely close race in the british general election is highlighting the differences between that country 's first-past-the-post electoral system , and the model based on proportional representation here in germany .
buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

rival boeing says a win by eads will cost americans jobs . european aerospace giant eads plans to compete with american rival boeing to bid on a $ 35 billion -lrb- 26.1 billion euro -rrb- deal to supply the us air force with new aerial refueling tankers .
" this is a hell of an opportunity , " said ralph crosby , chairman of eads north america , at a press conference in washington dc on tuesday .
crosby said eads felt " almost compelled " to enter the competition to offer its a330-based tanker , which it feels is superior to boeing 's 767-based tanker .
" when you 've got the best , you 've got to offer it , " he said .
eads -lrb- european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- will now bid as the prime contractor for the project .
its us partner northrop grumman dropped out six weeks ago , amid complaints that washington was engaging in protectionism that favored boeing .
northrop and eads won a previous us tanker contract in 2008 , but the pentagon canceled the deal after government auditors upheld a protest by boeing that said errors were made in the bid process .
bidding reopened earlier this year , and the competing companies now have until july 9 to submit their bids .
boeing backers boeing supporters in congress criticized the pentagon for extending the deadline , despite a recent report from the world trade organization that pointed out that eads benefited from government subsidies for its airplanes .
" it means we are bending over backwards to include a company that has broken the rules of fair play , " said senator patty murray , a democrat from washington state , where boeing would build the 179 airplanes .
critics also said an eads contract would end up costing more , both in terms of maintenance costs for the aircraft and american jobs .
crosby , however , stressed that eads remained committed to building the planes in the united states , creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country .
he added that they were working with its more than 200 suppliers to lower the maintenance costs .
the pentagon welcomed the renewed competition for the tanker replacement program , and said it expected to decide on a winner by " early fall .

critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .
speaking to reporters after the match , bayern coach louis van gaal said he thought his team had a good shot at making it to the final in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulalan got two yellow cards in three minutes " we got a good result , " he said .
" in our previous matches , our first leg results were not as good and we went through anyway .
i always think we can score away from home , so i think we can go through . "
bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .
" at half-time we said that a goalless draw would be a good result , " he said .
" but when they went a man down we knew that we could get more . "

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .

his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .

but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

" greece had hoped it could continue to borrow money at a reasonable level from the international markets in order to maintain some sort of fiscal independence , " he said . athens would prefer this to going to its eurozone partners and the imf for debt rescue .
but the amounts the markets are currently charging greece to borrow money longterm - over eight percent for a ten-year-bond - are " simply unsustainable " , brabant said .
" this is black wednesday for greece . "
not much room to manoeuvre " there is no question of greece being left high and dry in may , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference on tuesday .
" either it will borrow from the markets or borrow from our partners . "
the eurozone members of the eu have earmarked a package of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.33 billion -rrb- should aid become necessary ; the imf has pledged about 15 billion euros .
talks with the eu commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund are currently underway in athens , where the government is trying to raise the 10 billion euros it needs to roll over debt , make bond interest payments totalling 8.5 billion euros , and finance its deficit in may .

the german contribution to the greek debt rescue would amount to eight billion euros worth of credit .

strike action in greece , the unions have launched two days of strikes .
the public sector is set to shut down on thursday for 24 hours , which is the civil servants ' fourth action this year . according to brabant , there is considerable potential for social unrest in the country as many greeks believe an aid deal would lead to a further deterioration of their living standards .
and many are worried about the involvement of the imf in the rescue package , brabant said . " they are concerned that they will really be hawkish in the way in which they demand that severe cuts are made in return for their contribution to this bailout package . "
austerity measures already in place were , he said , designed to fill government coffers .

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .
" i know i have many critics , " ramsauer told lawmakers in the plenary hall of the reichstag building .
" but i warn against using purely party-political reasoning in interpreting the decisions taken during the crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter ramsauer defended his handling of the crisis the minister added it would have been gravely irresponsible not to impose the strictest possible flight bans in the face of a spreading plume of volcanic ash above much of europe and the lack of reliable scientific data concerning the impact of ash particles on jet engines .
he was aware , he said , of the huge economic damage that airlines and other businesses had incurred , but insisted that , even with the benefit of hindsight , he could see no alternative to the measures taken .
visual flight decision criticized opposition leaders expressed doubts about the minister 's efficiency in handling the crisis .
they could not understand why mr. ramsauer allowed some planes to take off as early as last saturday with visual flight rules applied , that is even before scientists here launched a special flight to measure the composition and density of volcanic ash particles in german skies .
opposition social democrat transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer criticized the fact that the minister had set up a crisis team at the german aviation control center at langen , near frankfurt , rather than calling the shots from berlin .
" this would have enabled mr. ramsauer to take better care of some important aspects of the crisis , " beckmeyer said .
" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "
handling the aftermath the transport minister announced that all german airlines must now report all cases of damage caused by ash particles to a special center at the federal aviation office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuhlsbuettel airport in hamburg braces for some louder nights also , inspection and maintenance routines should be carried out at shorter intervals in future .
authorities in germany 's 16 federal state are now considering the lifting of flight bans during nighttime to help passengers still stranded abroad return home more quickly .
christian democrat legislator dirk fischer said he hoped people living near german airports would show some understanding for such an emergency measure .
" the city-state of hamburg is leading the way , " fischer said .
" remarkably , its decision to let planes start and land also during nighttime is even backed by a senator from the green party which would n't normally support anything like this . "

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .

" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .

“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .

war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.04.2010 german cinemas forced to sharpen focus in 3d age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about what you see , not what you look like while germany enjoys international renown for its generosity to film producers and directors , it has so far done nothing to help its cinemas into the 3d digital age .
and now time is beginning to run out . avatar was always going to be a big deal , but the german cinema landscape was quite unprepared for the mayhem and uncertainty it has left in its wake .
james cameron 's blockbuster came , was seen , and conquered the senses of a new generation of cinema-goers .
the word on the blogs is that 3d rocks and there is no way back .
but keeping pace with audience demands is easier said than done in germany , where cinemas have been rather ponderous in their willingness to embrace the technology it takes to screen the likes of avatar and alice in wonderland in all their three-dimensional glory .
a year ago , just 30 of the nation 's 4,000 plus screens were equipped with the technology necessary to run 3d flicks .
and although that number has now reached somewhere between five and six hundred , there are still a lot of old-school picture houses dotted about the country .
out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avatar was a game-changer as quaint as that scenario might sound , it is potentially very damaging to the cinema industry .
kai bartels , who runs a four-screen cinema in quickborn , a small town just north of hamburg , is all too aware of the need to move with the times .
" we screened avatar as a normal film and everyone who came to buy a ticket wanted to know if it was in 3d and where they could get their glasses , " bartels told deutsche welle .
" we lost out on that film . "
by contrast , the uci chain , which has more than 200 screens nationwide , some 40 of which are now equipped to show movies in 3d , reported a 13 percent increase in attendance levels last year .
spokesman thomas schulke says that surge in business is largely due to 3d films .
" all except one of our number one films this year have been 3d , " he said .
" there is a huge demand , people want a different viewing experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from alice in wonderland schulke believes that this time around , 3d is here to stay , and with companies such as dreamworks dedicating their entire 2010 production slate to three-dimensional pictures , he could well be right .
strapped for cash in the country so why , in that case , are n't there more german cinemas making the transition necessary to secure them a piece of the juicy new pie ?
jasko jochenhoevel , academic assistant at the potsdam film and television academy , says it is simply a question of money .
" a digital projector costs somewhere in the realm of 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 107,000 -rrb- , and then another 30,000 on top to make it 3d compatible , " jochenhoevel said .
“ and a lot of smaller cinemas just ca n't afford it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of small town cinemas ?
and therein lies a potentially devastating problem .
because keeping up with the times is not only about being able to screen the latest 3d releases , it is about becoming digital per se .
cinemas that can only play analogue films will ultimately be nudged out of the listings , whether they run arthouse or more commercial programs .
" digitial is the future , that 's a fact , " bartels said .
" there will come a time when distributors only work with digital copies .
it could be in two or in five years , but that moment will come . "
every cinema for itself when it does , bartels wants to be ready , so has begun looking at ways to make it happen .
essentially that means taking out a loan , because despite good intentions on the part of german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , no money has been made available to ease the path to the far side of the digital divide .
" we 've always been told -lsb- funding -rsb- will come , but it has n't so far and just sitting around waiting is too dangerous in this competitive climate , " bartels said .
the ffa first began drawing up plans for a comprehensive digitalization concept four years ago .
the initial idea was that cinema operators , distributors , film funding bodies and the government would put a total of 280 million euros into a " solidarity fund " from which cinemas nationwide would have been entitled to draw .
but the fund became overshadowed by an ongoing battle between some movie theaters and the ffa over screening fees , and subsequently never made it beyond the planning stages .
bildunterschrift : a larger than life , 3d version of shrek is due to hit the screens this year further efforts to come up with a new concept have also failed , and although a spokesman for the ffa told deutsche welle that there are new ideas in the pipeline , they are still a long way from becoming reality .
" we are all hoping , all waiting , but nobody knows when it -lsb- the fund -rsb- will come , " the spokesman said .
in the meantime , the larger cinemas have taken it upon themselves to go digital , and given their huge seating capacities , the surcharge on 3d tickets and their competitive advantage , they are in a good position .
it stands to reason that they 're not keen to share the new and highly lucrative market with everyone else .
and if a deal can not be struck at some point in the relatively near future , they might not have to . author : tamsin walker editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rival boeing says a win by eads will cost americans jobs . european aerospace giant eads plans to compete with american rival boeing to bid on a $ 35 billion -lrb- 26.1 billion euro -rrb- deal to supply the us air force with new aerial refueling tankers .
" this is a hell of an opportunity , " said ralph crosby , chairman of eads north america , at a press conference in washington dc on tuesday .
crosby said eads felt " almost compelled " to enter the competition to offer its a330-based tanker , which it feels is superior to boeing 's 767-based tanker .
" when you 've got the best , you 've got to offer it , " he said .
eads -lrb- european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- will now bid as the prime contractor for the project .
its us partner northrop grumman dropped out six weeks ago , amid complaints that washington was engaging in protectionism that favored boeing .
northrop and eads won a previous us tanker contract in 2008 , but the pentagon canceled the deal after government auditors upheld a protest by boeing that said errors were made in the bid process .
bidding reopened earlier this year , and the competing companies now have until july 9 to submit their bids .
boeing backers boeing supporters in congress criticized the pentagon for extending the deadline , despite a recent report from the world trade organization that pointed out that eads benefited from government subsidies for its airplanes .

but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .
" i know i have many critics , " ramsauer told lawmakers in the plenary hall of the reichstag building .
" but i warn against using purely party-political reasoning in interpreting the decisions taken during the crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter ramsauer defended his handling of the crisis the minister added it would have been gravely irresponsible not to impose the strictest possible flight bans in the face of a spreading plume of volcanic ash above much of europe and the lack of reliable scientific data concerning the impact of ash particles on jet engines .
he was aware , he said , of the huge economic damage that airlines and other businesses had incurred , but insisted that , even with the benefit of hindsight , he could see no alternative to the measures taken .
visual flight decision criticized opposition leaders expressed doubts about the minister 's efficiency in handling the crisis .
they could not understand why mr. ramsauer allowed some planes to take off as early as last saturday with visual flight rules applied , that is even before scientists here launched a special flight to measure the composition and density of volcanic ash particles in german skies .
opposition social democrat transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer criticized the fact that the minister had set up a crisis team at the german aviation control center at langen , near frankfurt , rather than calling the shots from berlin .
" this would have enabled mr. ramsauer to take better care of some important aspects of the crisis , " beckmeyer said .
" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "
handling the aftermath the transport minister announced that all german airlines must now report all cases of damage caused by ash particles to a special center at the federal aviation office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuhlsbuettel airport in hamburg braces for some louder nights also , inspection and maintenance routines should be carried out at shorter intervals in future .
authorities in germany 's 16 federal state are now considering the lifting of flight bans during nighttime to help passengers still stranded abroad return home more quickly .
christian democrat legislator dirk fischer said he hoped people living near german airports would show some understanding for such an emergency measure .
" the city-state of hamburg is leading the way , " fischer said .
" remarkably , its decision to let planes start and land also during nighttime is even backed by a senator from the green party which would n't normally support anything like this . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 21.04.2010 built on sand : masdar city to become eco-city of the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of the future : artist 's vision of masdar in abu dhabi no co2 , no waste , no cars : the emirate of abu dhabi is building the world 's first sustainable city in the middle of the desert .
masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.04.2010 german cinemas forced to sharpen focus in 3d age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about what you see , not what you look like while germany enjoys international renown for its generosity to film producers and directors , it has so far done nothing to help its cinemas into the 3d digital age .
and now time is beginning to run out . avatar was always going to be a big deal , but the german cinema landscape was quite unprepared for the mayhem and uncertainty it has left in its wake .
james cameron 's blockbuster came , was seen , and conquered the senses of a new generation of cinema-goers .
the word on the blogs is that 3d rocks and there is no way back .
but keeping pace with audience demands is easier said than done in germany , where cinemas have been rather ponderous in their willingness to embrace the technology it takes to screen the likes of avatar and alice in wonderland in all their three-dimensional glory .
a year ago , just 30 of the nation 's 4,000 plus screens were equipped with the technology necessary to run 3d flicks .
and although that number has now reached somewhere between five and six hundred , there are still a lot of old-school picture houses dotted about the country .
out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avatar was a game-changer as quaint as that scenario might sound , it is potentially very damaging to the cinema industry .
kai bartels , who runs a four-screen cinema in quickborn , a small town just north of hamburg , is all too aware of the need to move with the times .
" we screened avatar as a normal film and everyone who came to buy a ticket wanted to know if it was in 3d and where they could get their glasses , " bartels told deutsche welle .
" we lost out on that film . "
by contrast , the uci chain , which has more than 200 screens nationwide , some 40 of which are now equipped to show movies in 3d , reported a 13 percent increase in attendance levels last year .
spokesman thomas schulke says that surge in business is largely due to 3d films .
" all except one of our number one films this year have been 3d , " he said .
" there is a huge demand , people want a different viewing experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from alice in wonderland schulke believes that this time around , 3d is here to stay , and with companies such as dreamworks dedicating their entire 2010 production slate to three-dimensional pictures , he could well be right .
strapped for cash in the country so why , in that case , are n't there more german cinemas making the transition necessary to secure them a piece of the juicy new pie ?
jasko jochenhoevel , academic assistant at the potsdam film and television academy , says it is simply a question of money .
" a digital projector costs somewhere in the realm of 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 107,000 -rrb- , and then another 30,000 on top to make it 3d compatible , " jochenhoevel said .
“ and a lot of smaller cinemas just ca n't afford it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of small town cinemas ?
and therein lies a potentially devastating problem .
because keeping up with the times is not only about being able to screen the latest 3d releases , it is about becoming digital per se .
cinemas that can only play analogue films will ultimately be nudged out of the listings , whether they run arthouse or more commercial programs .
" digitial is the future , that 's a fact , " bartels said .
" there will come a time when distributors only work with digital copies .
it could be in two or in five years , but that moment will come . "
every cinema for itself when it does , bartels wants to be ready , so has begun looking at ways to make it happen .
essentially that means taking out a loan , because despite good intentions on the part of german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , no money has been made available to ease the path to the far side of the digital divide .
" we 've always been told -lsb- funding -rsb- will come , but it has n't so far and just sitting around waiting is too dangerous in this competitive climate , " bartels said .
the ffa first began drawing up plans for a comprehensive digitalization concept four years ago .
the initial idea was that cinema operators , distributors , film funding bodies and the government would put a total of 280 million euros into a " solidarity fund " from which cinemas nationwide would have been entitled to draw .
but the fund became overshadowed by an ongoing battle between some movie theaters and the ffa over screening fees , and subsequently never made it beyond the planning stages .
bildunterschrift : a larger than life , 3d version of shrek is due to hit the screens this year further efforts to come up with a new concept have also failed , and although a spokesman for the ffa told deutsche welle that there are new ideas in the pipeline , they are still a long way from becoming reality .
" we are all hoping , all waiting , but nobody knows when it -lsb- the fund -rsb- will come , " the spokesman said .
in the meantime , the larger cinemas have taken it upon themselves to go digital , and given their huge seating capacities , the surcharge on 3d tickets and their competitive advantage , they are in a good position .
it stands to reason that they 're not keen to share the new and highly lucrative market with everyone else .
and if a deal can not be struck at some point in the relatively near future , they might not have to . author : tamsin walker editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.04.2010 why germany 's electoral system would turn the british vote upside down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy has many forms ; germany 's differs from britain 's national elections are approaching in britain , and a big regional ballot follows a few days later in germany , but the results in each country will be reached using different systems of representation . the extremely close race in the british general election is highlighting the differences between that country 's first-past-the-post electoral system , and the model based on proportional representation here in germany .
buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : haiti marks one-year earthquake anniversary one year on , aid organizations try to prevent total collapse in haiti haitian aid group : ' with cholera , rapid action is critical ' problematic election seeks to shore up teetering haiti soaring cholera death toll adds to desperation in haiti natural disasters -pipe- 21.04.2010 international aid helped haiti , but a lot more is needed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead of provisional tent camps , aid organizations now plan to build light homes due to a massive global help effort , the situation in haiti has stabilized 100 days after a devastating earthquake ravaged the country .
but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .

" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .

building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.04.2010 why germany 's electoral system would turn the british vote upside down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy has many forms ; germany 's differs from britain 's national elections are approaching in britain , and a big regional ballot follows a few days later in germany , but the results in each country will be reached using different systems of representation . the extremely close race in the british general election is highlighting the differences between that country 's first-past-the-post electoral system , and the model based on proportional representation here in germany .
buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

rival boeing says a win by eads will cost americans jobs . european aerospace giant eads plans to compete with american rival boeing to bid on a $ 35 billion -lrb- 26.1 billion euro -rrb- deal to supply the us air force with new aerial refueling tankers .
" this is a hell of an opportunity , " said ralph crosby , chairman of eads north america , at a press conference in washington dc on tuesday .
crosby said eads felt " almost compelled " to enter the competition to offer its a330-based tanker , which it feels is superior to boeing 's 767-based tanker .
" when you 've got the best , you 've got to offer it , " he said .
eads -lrb- european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- will now bid as the prime contractor for the project .
its us partner northrop grumman dropped out six weeks ago , amid complaints that washington was engaging in protectionism that favored boeing .
northrop and eads won a previous us tanker contract in 2008 , but the pentagon canceled the deal after government auditors upheld a protest by boeing that said errors were made in the bid process .
bidding reopened earlier this year , and the competing companies now have until july 9 to submit their bids .
boeing backers boeing supporters in congress criticized the pentagon for extending the deadline , despite a recent report from the world trade organization that pointed out that eads benefited from government subsidies for its airplanes .
" it means we are bending over backwards to include a company that has broken the rules of fair play , " said senator patty murray , a democrat from washington state , where boeing would build the 179 airplanes .
critics also said an eads contract would end up costing more , both in terms of maintenance costs for the aircraft and american jobs .
crosby , however , stressed that eads remained committed to building the planes in the united states , creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country .
he added that they were working with its more than 200 suppliers to lower the maintenance costs .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

crosby said eads felt " almost compelled " to enter the competition to offer its a330-based tanker , which it feels is superior to boeing 's 767-based tanker .
" when you 've got the best , you 've got to offer it , " he said .
eads -lrb- european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- will now bid as the prime contractor for the project .
its us partner northrop grumman dropped out six weeks ago , amid complaints that washington was engaging in protectionism that favored boeing .
northrop and eads won a previous us tanker contract in 2008 , but the pentagon canceled the deal after government auditors upheld a protest by boeing that said errors were made in the bid process .
bidding reopened earlier this year , and the competing companies now have until july 9 to submit their bids .
boeing backers boeing supporters in congress criticized the pentagon for extending the deadline , despite a recent report from the world trade organization that pointed out that eads benefited from government subsidies for its airplanes .
" it means we are bending over backwards to include a company that has broken the rules of fair play , " said senator patty murray , a democrat from washington state , where boeing would build the 179 airplanes .
critics also said an eads contract would end up costing more , both in terms of maintenance costs for the aircraft and american jobs .
crosby , however , stressed that eads remained committed to building the planes in the united states , creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country .
he added that they were working with its more than 200 suppliers to lower the maintenance costs .
the pentagon welcomed the renewed competition for the tanker replacement program , and said it expected to decide on a winner by " early fall .

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .

bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .
" at half-time we said that a goalless draw would be a good result , " he said .

critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .
speaking to reporters after the match , bayern coach louis van gaal said he thought his team had a good shot at making it to the final in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulalan got two yellow cards in three minutes " we got a good result , " he said .
" in our previous matches , our first leg results were not as good and we went through anyway .
i always think we can score away from home , so i think we can go through . "
bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .
" at half-time we said that a goalless draw would be a good result , " he said .
" but when they went a man down we knew that we could get more . "

" greece had hoped it could continue to borrow money at a reasonable level from the international markets in order to maintain some sort of fiscal independence , " he said . athens would prefer this to going to its eurozone partners and the imf for debt rescue .
but the amounts the markets are currently charging greece to borrow money longterm - over eight percent for a ten-year-bond - are " simply unsustainable " , brabant said .
" this is black wednesday for greece . "
not much room to manoeuvre " there is no question of greece being left high and dry in may , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference on tuesday .
" either it will borrow from the markets or borrow from our partners . "
the eurozone members of the eu have earmarked a package of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.33 billion -rrb- should aid become necessary ; the imf has pledged about 15 billion euros .

the public sector is set to shut down on thursday for 24 hours , which is the civil servants ' fourth action this year . according to brabant , there is considerable potential for social unrest in the country as many greeks believe an aid deal would lead to a further deterioration of their living standards .
and many are worried about the involvement of the imf in the rescue package , brabant said . " they are concerned that they will really be hawkish in the way in which they demand that severe cuts are made in return for their contribution to this bailout package . "
austerity measures already in place were , he said , designed to fill government coffers .

" greece had hoped it could continue to borrow money at a reasonable level from the international markets in order to maintain some sort of fiscal independence , " he said . athens would prefer this to going to its eurozone partners and the imf for debt rescue .
but the amounts the markets are currently charging greece to borrow money longterm - over eight percent for a ten-year-bond - are " simply unsustainable " , brabant said .
" this is black wednesday for greece . "
not much room to manoeuvre " there is no question of greece being left high and dry in may , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference on tuesday .
" either it will borrow from the markets or borrow from our partners . "
the eurozone members of the eu have earmarked a package of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.33 billion -rrb- should aid become necessary ; the imf has pledged about 15 billion euros .

the public sector is set to shut down on thursday for 24 hours , which is the civil servants ' fourth action this year . according to brabant , there is considerable potential for social unrest in the country as many greeks believe an aid deal would lead to a further deterioration of their living standards .
and many are worried about the involvement of the imf in the rescue package , brabant said . " they are concerned that they will really be hawkish in the way in which they demand that severe cuts are made in return for their contribution to this bailout package . "
austerity measures already in place were , he said , designed to fill government coffers .
but they seemed to be backfiring : " everybody is terrified of spending money , businesses are going bust , there 's no confidence on the streets ; this is a very depressed country and things only look as thought they are going to get worse .

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .

us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

rival boeing says a win by eads will cost americans jobs . european aerospace giant eads plans to compete with american rival boeing to bid on a $ 35 billion -lrb- 26.1 billion euro -rrb- deal to supply the us air force with new aerial refueling tankers .
" this is a hell of an opportunity , " said ralph crosby , chairman of eads north america , at a press conference in washington dc on tuesday .
crosby said eads felt " almost compelled " to enter the competition to offer its a330-based tanker , which it feels is superior to boeing 's 767-based tanker .
" when you 've got the best , you 've got to offer it , " he said .
eads -lrb- european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- will now bid as the prime contractor for the project .
its us partner northrop grumman dropped out six weeks ago , amid complaints that washington was engaging in protectionism that favored boeing .
northrop and eads won a previous us tanker contract in 2008 , but the pentagon canceled the deal after government auditors upheld a protest by boeing that said errors were made in the bid process .
bidding reopened earlier this year , and the competing companies now have until july 9 to submit their bids .
boeing backers boeing supporters in congress criticized the pentagon for extending the deadline , despite a recent report from the world trade organization that pointed out that eads benefited from government subsidies for its airplanes .
" it means we are bending over backwards to include a company that has broken the rules of fair play , " said senator patty murray , a democrat from washington state , where boeing would build the 179 airplanes .
critics also said an eads contract would end up costing more , both in terms of maintenance costs for the aircraft and american jobs .
crosby , however , stressed that eads remained committed to building the planes in the united states , creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country .
he added that they were working with its more than 200 suppliers to lower the maintenance costs .
the pentagon welcomed the renewed competition for the tanker replacement program , and said it expected to decide on a winner by " early fall .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "

as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .
43 german soldiers have died so far during the afghanistan mission .

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .
43 german soldiers have died so far during the afghanistan mission .
with over 4,000 troops , germany has the third largest military contingent in afghanistan behind the united states and great britain. dfm / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" greece had hoped it could continue to borrow money at a reasonable level from the international markets in order to maintain some sort of fiscal independence , " he said . athens would prefer this to going to its eurozone partners and the imf for debt rescue .
but the amounts the markets are currently charging greece to borrow money longterm - over eight percent for a ten-year-bond - are " simply unsustainable " , brabant said .
" this is black wednesday for greece . "
not much room to manoeuvre " there is no question of greece being left high and dry in may , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference on tuesday .
" either it will borrow from the markets or borrow from our partners . "
the eurozone members of the eu have earmarked a package of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.33 billion -rrb- should aid become necessary ; the imf has pledged about 15 billion euros .
talks with the eu commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund are currently underway in athens , where the government is trying to raise the 10 billion euros it needs to roll over debt , make bond interest payments totalling 8.5 billion euros , and finance its deficit in may .

the public sector is set to shut down on thursday for 24 hours , which is the civil servants ' fourth action this year . according to brabant , there is considerable potential for social unrest in the country as many greeks believe an aid deal would lead to a further deterioration of their living standards .
and many are worried about the involvement of the imf in the rescue package , brabant said . " they are concerned that they will really be hawkish in the way in which they demand that severe cuts are made in return for their contribution to this bailout package . "
austerity measures already in place were , he said , designed to fill government coffers .

critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .

bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .
" at half-time we said that a goalless draw would be a good result , " he said .
" but when they went a man down we knew that we could get more . "

" greece had hoped it could continue to borrow money at a reasonable level from the international markets in order to maintain some sort of fiscal independence , " he said . athens would prefer this to going to its eurozone partners and the imf for debt rescue .

the public sector is set to shut down on thursday for 24 hours , which is the civil servants ' fourth action this year . according to brabant , there is considerable potential for social unrest in the country as many greeks believe an aid deal would lead to a further deterioration of their living standards .
and many are worried about the involvement of the imf in the rescue package , brabant said . " they are concerned that they will really be hawkish in the way in which they demand that severe cuts are made in return for their contribution to this bailout package . "
austerity measures already in place were , he said , designed to fill government coffers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 21.04.2010 built on sand : masdar city to become eco-city of the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of the future : artist 's vision of masdar in abu dhabi no co2 , no waste , no cars : the emirate of abu dhabi is building the world 's first sustainable city in the middle of the desert .
masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .

" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .
" i know i have many critics , " ramsauer told lawmakers in the plenary hall of the reichstag building .
" but i warn against using purely party-political reasoning in interpreting the decisions taken during the crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter ramsauer defended his handling of the crisis the minister added it would have been gravely irresponsible not to impose the strictest possible flight bans in the face of a spreading plume of volcanic ash above much of europe and the lack of reliable scientific data concerning the impact of ash particles on jet engines .
he was aware , he said , of the huge economic damage that airlines and other businesses had incurred , but insisted that , even with the benefit of hindsight , he could see no alternative to the measures taken .
visual flight decision criticized opposition leaders expressed doubts about the minister 's efficiency in handling the crisis .
they could not understand why mr. ramsauer allowed some planes to take off as early as last saturday with visual flight rules applied , that is even before scientists here launched a special flight to measure the composition and density of volcanic ash particles in german skies .
opposition social democrat transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer criticized the fact that the minister had set up a crisis team at the german aviation control center at langen , near frankfurt , rather than calling the shots from berlin .
" this would have enabled mr. ramsauer to take better care of some important aspects of the crisis , " beckmeyer said .
" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "
handling the aftermath the transport minister announced that all german airlines must now report all cases of damage caused by ash particles to a special center at the federal aviation office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuhlsbuettel airport in hamburg braces for some louder nights also , inspection and maintenance routines should be carried out at shorter intervals in future .
authorities in germany 's 16 federal state are now considering the lifting of flight bans during nighttime to help passengers still stranded abroad return home more quickly .
christian democrat legislator dirk fischer said he hoped people living near german airports would show some understanding for such an emergency measure .
" the city-state of hamburg is leading the way , " fischer said .
" remarkably , its decision to let planes start and land also during nighttime is even backed by a senator from the green party which would n't normally support anything like this . "

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .
43 german soldiers have died so far during the afghanistan mission .
with over 4,000 troops , germany has the third largest military contingent in afghanistan behind the united states and great britain. dfm / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .

mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .

mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .

the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .

financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 21.04.2010 german jihadists targeting nato troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german jihadists have claimed responsility for attacks in afghanistan in a recent internet video , german jihadists fighting on the side of the taliban in the hindukush are seen boasting of attacks on american and afghan troops . heavily armed , sometimes disguised or covered in elaborate headgear - this is how the german jihadists present themselves on the internet .
online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.04.2010 german cinemas forced to sharpen focus in 3d age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about what you see , not what you look like while germany enjoys international renown for its generosity to film producers and directors , it has so far done nothing to help its cinemas into the 3d digital age .
and now time is beginning to run out . avatar was always going to be a big deal , but the german cinema landscape was quite unprepared for the mayhem and uncertainty it has left in its wake .
james cameron 's blockbuster came , was seen , and conquered the senses of a new generation of cinema-goers .
the word on the blogs is that 3d rocks and there is no way back .
but keeping pace with audience demands is easier said than done in germany , where cinemas have been rather ponderous in their willingness to embrace the technology it takes to screen the likes of avatar and alice in wonderland in all their three-dimensional glory .
a year ago , just 30 of the nation 's 4,000 plus screens were equipped with the technology necessary to run 3d flicks .
and although that number has now reached somewhere between five and six hundred , there are still a lot of old-school picture houses dotted about the country .
out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avatar was a game-changer as quaint as that scenario might sound , it is potentially very damaging to the cinema industry .
kai bartels , who runs a four-screen cinema in quickborn , a small town just north of hamburg , is all too aware of the need to move with the times .
" we screened avatar as a normal film and everyone who came to buy a ticket wanted to know if it was in 3d and where they could get their glasses , " bartels told deutsche welle .
" we lost out on that film . "
by contrast , the uci chain , which has more than 200 screens nationwide , some 40 of which are now equipped to show movies in 3d , reported a 13 percent increase in attendance levels last year .
spokesman thomas schulke says that surge in business is largely due to 3d films .
" all except one of our number one films this year have been 3d , " he said .
" there is a huge demand , people want a different viewing experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from alice in wonderland schulke believes that this time around , 3d is here to stay , and with companies such as dreamworks dedicating their entire 2010 production slate to three-dimensional pictures , he could well be right .
strapped for cash in the country so why , in that case , are n't there more german cinemas making the transition necessary to secure them a piece of the juicy new pie ?
jasko jochenhoevel , academic assistant at the potsdam film and television academy , says it is simply a question of money .
" a digital projector costs somewhere in the realm of 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 107,000 -rrb- , and then another 30,000 on top to make it 3d compatible , " jochenhoevel said .
“ and a lot of smaller cinemas just ca n't afford it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of small town cinemas ?
and therein lies a potentially devastating problem .
because keeping up with the times is not only about being able to screen the latest 3d releases , it is about becoming digital per se .
cinemas that can only play analogue films will ultimately be nudged out of the listings , whether they run arthouse or more commercial programs .
" digitial is the future , that 's a fact , " bartels said .
" there will come a time when distributors only work with digital copies .
it could be in two or in five years , but that moment will come . "
every cinema for itself when it does , bartels wants to be ready , so has begun looking at ways to make it happen .
essentially that means taking out a loan , because despite good intentions on the part of german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , no money has been made available to ease the path to the far side of the digital divide .
" we 've always been told -lsb- funding -rsb- will come , but it has n't so far and just sitting around waiting is too dangerous in this competitive climate , " bartels said .
the ffa first began drawing up plans for a comprehensive digitalization concept four years ago .
the initial idea was that cinema operators , distributors , film funding bodies and the government would put a total of 280 million euros into a " solidarity fund " from which cinemas nationwide would have been entitled to draw .
but the fund became overshadowed by an ongoing battle between some movie theaters and the ffa over screening fees , and subsequently never made it beyond the planning stages .
bildunterschrift : a larger than life , 3d version of shrek is due to hit the screens this year further efforts to come up with a new concept have also failed , and although a spokesman for the ffa told deutsche welle that there are new ideas in the pipeline , they are still a long way from becoming reality .
" we are all hoping , all waiting , but nobody knows when it -lsb- the fund -rsb- will come , " the spokesman said .
in the meantime , the larger cinemas have taken it upon themselves to go digital , and given their huge seating capacities , the surcharge on 3d tickets and their competitive advantage , they are in a good position .
it stands to reason that they 're not keen to share the new and highly lucrative market with everyone else .
and if a deal can not be struck at some point in the relatively near future , they might not have to . author : tamsin walker editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti . the praise for the haiti international donors ' conference held a few weeks back , which raised $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in long-term aid committments and far exceeded expectations , was unanimous .
at a press conference after the meeting un secretary general ban ki-moon said the world had shown its " solidarity with haiti and its people , " adding that haitian president rene preval 's " rendezvous with history has come to pass . "
us secretary of state hillary clinton sounded less melodramatic , but equally pleased when she said that " this signals a new level of global commitment , coordination , and cooperation . "
and the haitian government considered the international support " testimony that haiti is not alone . "
yet , despite the unprecedented level of aid and donations from around the world , the money pledged at the conference in new york simply wo n't be enough to rebuild the country .
" by no means , " says joerg kaiser , the project officer for haiti at caritas international , a relief organisation funded by germany 's catholic church .
" it sounds like a lot of money , but when we see what has been destroyed by the earthquake , and also what existed before the earthquake , i have to say that this money will never be enough , " he told deutsche welle .
jean robert saget , haiti 's ambassador to germany , agrees : " this will definitely not be enough .
like the us vice president said recently , if you want to make haiti really fit for the future , you need around $ 34 billion .
the $ 10 billion pledges are the beginning of a process and we hope that this will enable a decent start . "
help available for the needy both kaiser and saget travelled to haiti after the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and devastated a nation that even before the disaster ranked among the poorest countries in the world .
they spent most of february there and reported that , since the chaotic first weeks , the situation had improved recently and that the most urgent needs of the survivors have been met .
" i would say that almost all people who need help get help , " said kaiser .
his organisation , caritas , still distributes food and non-food items in haiti , but because of the improved situation plans to phase out those distributions by the end of the month .
then the focus of the mission will shift from basic aid to reconstruction efforts .
bildunterschrift : building a new haiti , not rebuilding it , is the goal of international helpers " we are looking into what we call semi-permanent shelter - light houses that serve for a couple of years until real houses can be built .
and we are rebuilding homes for elderly and handicapped people and we still run two medical centers , " he said . to oversee those projects and the roughly 20 million euros it collected through donations , caritas will increase its team of international experts from two to five and maintain its national staff of around 25 people .
building a new haiti the experts and their help will be needed for a long time to come .
analysts predict that it will take up to 10 years to rebuild haiti .
but rebuild is actually the wrong word to describe what is planned , says kaiser .
" i do want to say that we do not want to rebuild haiti .
according to all the sources that i have heard , nobody wants to rebuild what was there before , but everybody is talking about building a new haiti .
if you see that a huge part of the population was living in slums in port-au-prince , that is a situation that was unbearable , and that will be changed . "
to achieve that goal , haiti 's ambassador in berlin hopes that the german government , which pledged 55 million euros , will increase its support for his country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than one million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake " i personally would have wished that germany would get more involved , " says saget .
" we have registered that france has gotten very involved , but that germany has hesitated a bit .
but it 's not too late and we are in talks with the authorities and hope that germany will play a bigger role . "
joerg kaiser believes that the decision by the german government to limit its initial contributions was right .
he argues that there is already so much money pouring into the country that the first priority must be to allocate and distribute the huge amount of finanical aid properly .
" i would say that the 55 million is enough .
let 's wait some time , let 's wait what 's going to happen , and let 's wait where the needs will show up in half a year or a year .
then it 's easier to say how much more money will be needed and for what . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.04.2010 german cinemas forced to sharpen focus in 3d age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's about what you see , not what you look like while germany enjoys international renown for its generosity to film producers and directors , it has so far done nothing to help its cinemas into the 3d digital age .
and now time is beginning to run out . avatar was always going to be a big deal , but the german cinema landscape was quite unprepared for the mayhem and uncertainty it has left in its wake .
james cameron 's blockbuster came , was seen , and conquered the senses of a new generation of cinema-goers .
the word on the blogs is that 3d rocks and there is no way back .
but keeping pace with audience demands is easier said than done in germany , where cinemas have been rather ponderous in their willingness to embrace the technology it takes to screen the likes of avatar and alice in wonderland in all their three-dimensional glory .
a year ago , just 30 of the nation 's 4,000 plus screens were equipped with the technology necessary to run 3d flicks .
and although that number has now reached somewhere between five and six hundred , there are still a lot of old-school picture houses dotted about the country .
out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avatar was a game-changer as quaint as that scenario might sound , it is potentially very damaging to the cinema industry .
kai bartels , who runs a four-screen cinema in quickborn , a small town just north of hamburg , is all too aware of the need to move with the times .
" we screened avatar as a normal film and everyone who came to buy a ticket wanted to know if it was in 3d and where they could get their glasses , " bartels told deutsche welle .
" we lost out on that film . "
by contrast , the uci chain , which has more than 200 screens nationwide , some 40 of which are now equipped to show movies in 3d , reported a 13 percent increase in attendance levels last year .
spokesman thomas schulke says that surge in business is largely due to 3d films .
" all except one of our number one films this year have been 3d , " he said .
" there is a huge demand , people want a different viewing experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from alice in wonderland schulke believes that this time around , 3d is here to stay , and with companies such as dreamworks dedicating their entire 2010 production slate to three-dimensional pictures , he could well be right .
strapped for cash in the country so why , in that case , are n't there more german cinemas making the transition necessary to secure them a piece of the juicy new pie ?
jasko jochenhoevel , academic assistant at the potsdam film and television academy , says it is simply a question of money .
" a digital projector costs somewhere in the realm of 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 107,000 -rrb- , and then another 30,000 on top to make it 3d compatible , " jochenhoevel said .
“ and a lot of smaller cinemas just ca n't afford it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of small town cinemas ?
and therein lies a potentially devastating problem .
because keeping up with the times is not only about being able to screen the latest 3d releases , it is about becoming digital per se .
cinemas that can only play analogue films will ultimately be nudged out of the listings , whether they run arthouse or more commercial programs .
" digitial is the future , that 's a fact , " bartels said .
" there will come a time when distributors only work with digital copies .
it could be in two or in five years , but that moment will come . "
every cinema for itself when it does , bartels wants to be ready , so has begun looking at ways to make it happen .
essentially that means taking out a loan , because despite good intentions on the part of german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , no money has been made available to ease the path to the far side of the digital divide .
" we 've always been told -lsb- funding -rsb- will come , but it has n't so far and just sitting around waiting is too dangerous in this competitive climate , " bartels said .
the ffa first began drawing up plans for a comprehensive digitalization concept four years ago .
the initial idea was that cinema operators , distributors , film funding bodies and the government would put a total of 280 million euros into a " solidarity fund " from which cinemas nationwide would have been entitled to draw .
but the fund became overshadowed by an ongoing battle between some movie theaters and the ffa over screening fees , and subsequently never made it beyond the planning stages .
bildunterschrift : a larger than life , 3d version of shrek is due to hit the screens this year further efforts to come up with a new concept have also failed , and although a spokesman for the ffa told deutsche welle that there are new ideas in the pipeline , they are still a long way from becoming reality .
" we are all hoping , all waiting , but nobody knows when it -lsb- the fund -rsb- will come , " the spokesman said .
in the meantime , the larger cinemas have taken it upon themselves to go digital , and given their huge seating capacities , the surcharge on 3d tickets and their competitive advantage , they are in a good position .
it stands to reason that they 're not keen to share the new and highly lucrative market with everyone else .
and if a deal can not be struck at some point in the relatively near future , they might not have to . author : tamsin walker editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 21.04.2010 bayern shut out lyon in champions league semi-final first leg win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben was the hero again for bayern arjen robben 's lone goal was the difference in a match that saw two red cards and few scoring chances .
critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .
speaking to reporters after the match , bayern coach louis van gaal said he thought his team had a good shot at making it to the final in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulalan got two yellow cards in three minutes " we got a good result , " he said .
" in our previous matches , our first leg results were not as good and we went through anyway .
i always think we can score away from home , so i think we can go through . "
bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .
" at half-time we said that a goalless draw would be a good result , " he said .

critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .
speaking to reporters after the match , bayern coach louis van gaal said he thought his team had a good shot at making it to the final in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulalan got two yellow cards in three minutes " we got a good result , " he said .
" in our previous matches , our first leg results were not as good and we went through anyway .
i always think we can score away from home , so i think we can go through . "
bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .
" at half-time we said that a goalless draw would be a good result , " he said .
" but when they went a man down we knew that we could get more . "

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .
“ the germans are n't the taliban 's number one target and wo n't become it .
the taliban are fighting , as best they can , against all nato soldiers , ” he said .
musharbash said taliban are just as happy about romanian deaths as they are about german deaths .
he said the taliban should n't be overestimated - they are n't even able to reliably distinguish german soldiers from foreign troops .
in the case of the recently killed bundeswehr troops , the taliban claimed responsibility , although it has not yet emerged whether the taliban knew they were attacking german troops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 21.04.2010 bayern shut out lyon in champions league semi-final first leg win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben was the hero again for bayern arjen robben 's lone goal was the difference in a match that saw two red cards and few scoring chances .
critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .
speaking to reporters after the match , bayern coach louis van gaal said he thought his team had a good shot at making it to the final in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulalan got two yellow cards in three minutes " we got a good result , " he said .

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the public sector is set to shut down on thursday for 24 hours , which is the civil servants ' fourth action this year . according to brabant , there is considerable potential for social unrest in the country as many greeks believe an aid deal would lead to a further deterioration of their living standards .
and many are worried about the involvement of the imf in the rescue package , brabant said . " they are concerned that they will really be hawkish in the way in which they demand that severe cuts are made in return for their contribution to this bailout package . "

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .
43 german soldiers have died so far during the afghanistan mission .
with over 4,000 troops , germany has the third largest military contingent in afghanistan behind the united states and great britain. dfm / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .
43 german soldiers have died so far during the afghanistan mission .
with over 4,000 troops , germany has the third largest military contingent in afghanistan behind the united states and great britain. dfm / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.04.2010 why germany 's electoral system would turn the british vote upside down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy has many forms ; germany 's differs from britain 's national elections are approaching in britain , and a big regional ballot follows a few days later in germany , but the results in each country will be reached using different systems of representation . the extremely close race in the british general election is highlighting the differences between that country 's first-past-the-post electoral system , and the model based on proportional representation here in germany .
buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .

buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.04.2010 why germany 's electoral system would turn the british vote upside down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy has many forms ; germany 's differs from britain 's national elections are approaching in britain , and a big regional ballot follows a few days later in germany , but the results in each country will be reached using different systems of representation . the extremely close race in the british general election is highlighting the differences between that country 's first-past-the-post electoral system , and the model based on proportional representation here in germany .
buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .

the other defendant , hans-werner hartmann , who was in charge of accounting at the company 's telecommunications arm , was placed on probation for 18 months and fined 40,000 euros .

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .

" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .
" i know i have many critics , " ramsauer told lawmakers in the plenary hall of the reichstag building .
" but i warn against using purely party-political reasoning in interpreting the decisions taken during the crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter ramsauer defended his handling of the crisis the minister added it would have been gravely irresponsible not to impose the strictest possible flight bans in the face of a spreading plume of volcanic ash above much of europe and the lack of reliable scientific data concerning the impact of ash particles on jet engines .
he was aware , he said , of the huge economic damage that airlines and other businesses had incurred , but insisted that , even with the benefit of hindsight , he could see no alternative to the measures taken .
visual flight decision criticized opposition leaders expressed doubts about the minister 's efficiency in handling the crisis .
they could not understand why mr. ramsauer allowed some planes to take off as early as last saturday with visual flight rules applied , that is even before scientists here launched a special flight to measure the composition and density of volcanic ash particles in german skies .
opposition social democrat transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer criticized the fact that the minister had set up a crisis team at the german aviation control center at langen , near frankfurt , rather than calling the shots from berlin .
" this would have enabled mr. ramsauer to take better care of some important aspects of the crisis , " beckmeyer said .
" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "
handling the aftermath the transport minister announced that all german airlines must now report all cases of damage caused by ash particles to a special center at the federal aviation office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuhlsbuettel airport in hamburg braces for some louder nights also , inspection and maintenance routines should be carried out at shorter intervals in future .
authorities in germany 's 16 federal state are now considering the lifting of flight bans during nighttime to help passengers still stranded abroad return home more quickly .
christian democrat legislator dirk fischer said he hoped people living near german airports would show some understanding for such an emergency measure .
" the city-state of hamburg is leading the way , " fischer said .
" remarkably , its decision to let planes start and land also during nighttime is even backed by a senator from the green party which would n't normally support anything like this . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 21.04.2010 built on sand : masdar city to become eco-city of the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of the future : artist 's vision of masdar in abu dhabi no co2 , no waste , no cars : the emirate of abu dhabi is building the world 's first sustainable city in the middle of the desert .
masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

rival boeing says a win by eads will cost americans jobs . european aerospace giant eads plans to compete with american rival boeing to bid on a $ 35 billion -lrb- 26.1 billion euro -rrb- deal to supply the us air force with new aerial refueling tankers .
" this is a hell of an opportunity , " said ralph crosby , chairman of eads north america , at a press conference in washington dc on tuesday .
crosby said eads felt " almost compelled " to enter the competition to offer its a330-based tanker , which it feels is superior to boeing 's 767-based tanker .
" when you 've got the best , you 've got to offer it , " he said .
eads -lrb- european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- will now bid as the prime contractor for the project .
its us partner northrop grumman dropped out six weeks ago , amid complaints that washington was engaging in protectionism that favored boeing .
northrop and eads won a previous us tanker contract in 2008 , but the pentagon canceled the deal after government auditors upheld a protest by boeing that said errors were made in the bid process .
bidding reopened earlier this year , and the competing companies now have until july 9 to submit their bids .
boeing backers boeing supporters in congress criticized the pentagon for extending the deadline , despite a recent report from the world trade organization that pointed out that eads benefited from government subsidies for its airplanes .
" it means we are bending over backwards to include a company that has broken the rules of fair play , " said senator patty murray , a democrat from washington state , where boeing would build the 179 airplanes .
critics also said an eads contract would end up costing more , both in terms of maintenance costs for the aircraft and american jobs .
crosby , however , stressed that eads remained committed to building the planes in the united states , creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country .
he added that they were working with its more than 200 suppliers to lower the maintenance costs .
the pentagon welcomed the renewed competition for the tanker replacement program , and said it expected to decide on a winner by " early fall .

northrop and eads won a previous us tanker contract in 2008 , but the pentagon canceled the deal after government auditors upheld a protest by boeing that said errors were made in the bid process .
bidding reopened earlier this year , and the competing companies now have until july 9 to submit their bids .
boeing backers boeing supporters in congress criticized the pentagon for extending the deadline , despite a recent report from the world trade organization that pointed out that eads benefited from government subsidies for its airplanes .
" it means we are bending over backwards to include a company that has broken the rules of fair play , " said senator patty murray , a democrat from washington state , where boeing would build the 179 airplanes .
critics also said an eads contract would end up costing more , both in terms of maintenance costs for the aircraft and american jobs .
crosby , however , stressed that eads remained committed to building the planes in the united states , creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country .
he added that they were working with its more than 200 suppliers to lower the maintenance costs .
the pentagon welcomed the renewed competition for the tanker replacement program , and said it expected to decide on a winner by " early fall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 21.04.2010 german jihadists targeting nato troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german jihadists have claimed responsility for attacks in afghanistan in a recent internet video , german jihadists fighting on the side of the taliban in the hindukush are seen boasting of attacks on american and afghan troops . heavily armed , sometimes disguised or covered in elaborate headgear - this is how the german jihadists present themselves on the internet .
online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .

online , they post video messages where they pose in front of flags embroidered with verses from the koran , or demonstrate their shooting skills backed by bombastic music .
they call for a holy war against the infidels , boasting of attacks on foreign troops and threatening future assaults .
a new video emerges a few days ago , a new video emerged showing the fighters taking part in target practice at a training camp in afghanistan .
in the 31-minute-long video , the five german-speaking jihadists claimed responsibility for two attacks on american military installations in afghanistan .
they call themselves the german taliban mujahideen and are a relatively new group , according to yassin musharbash , an editor at german news portal spiegel online and an expert on islamic terrorism .
“ there seems to be between six and 10 german-speaking fighters who are in afghanistan , apparently acting under the command of the afghan taliban , ” he said .
they appear to have made their first online appearance in the fall .
german taliban according to musharbash 's assessment , the german taliban mujahideen -lrb- dtm -rrb- formed from the scattered remnants of the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , a relatively small group that had been active in afghanistan for years .
the four young men of the so-called " sauerland " group in germany also belonged to the iju .
they were sentenced to long prison terms in march for preparing planned terrorist attacks in germany . “ it 's my impression that the iju has been mostly destroyed , ” said musharbash .
only a few sporadic traces remain of the group on the internet .
the marauding foreign fighters of the iju apparently slipped under the wing of the afghan taliban .
there , the german jihadists were able to form their own brigade , the dtm .
musharbash speculated that their involvement in the attacks on the american and afghan bases , referenced in the video , could have been a sort of internship for the men .
“ the afghan taliban seem to have taken them along on two attacks - that 's what it looks like to me , ” he said .
“ and for their part , the german jihadists made a big propaganda video for the german-speaking public , to show that they 're not just sitting around but actually taking part . "
german jihadists in the hindukush in the estimation of security experts , about 100 germans have made their way to afghanistan and pakistan to allegedly train in terror camps and fight alongside the taliban against foreign soldiers .
many of them come from middle-class german families and converted to islam .
others are the sons or grandsons of muslim immigrants who have lived in germany for years .
what they all have in common is that they either discovered islam as new converts or , as muslims , rediscovered their faith and quickly became radicalized .
“ what is new is that many of these converts have taken their families with them to afghanistan , ” said musharbash .
with wives and children in tow , the german-speaking jihadists moved to the hindukush to take part in the fight against the troops of the international security assistance force .
some of them have since returned home , with possible plans to carry out attacks in germany in a worst-case scenario .
but a few dozen are likely still in afghanistan , according to musharbash .
does this mean that german taliban are fighting against german soldiers ?
war against international troops musharbash explains that the taliban are targeting foreign troops in afghanistan , no matter where they come from .

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bishop mixa said in a statement that " it hurts my heart that so many people have been caused grief .
i ask for forgiveness . "
however he failed to give any further explanation .
mixa is accused of severely physically abusing children decades ago , when he was pastor of a children 's orphanage in schrobenhausen .
he has previously strongly rejected the accusations that he used any kind of violence against children , but later acknowledged that he may have slapped some of them .
the prominent bishop made the statement after meeting with the priest council in his augsburg diocese in southern germany .
it said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
financial misconduct allegations the allegations against mixa were raised in late march , and the bishop has been under pressure to address them .
in early april , he denied the accusations and offered to meet with those who accused him , to speak of their " memories , experiences , criticisms " of their time at schrobenhausen .
he added he was " deeply shaken by the allegations . "
in addition to the accusations of physical abuse , bishop mixa is being investigated for alleged financial irregularities .
payments to the orphanage foundation , signed by mixa , for 55,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 28,200 euros or $ 37,900 -rrb- are missing receipts or invoices and there is no evidence who cashed them .
the investigation is also focusing on mixa 's expensive art collection and other artefacts and pieces of jewellery , all apparently bought by the foundation. cb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

buoyed by strong performances in recent televised debates between the candidates for the posts of prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- , the country 's traditional " third " party , the liberal democrats , has surged alongside the two main contenders , labour and the conservatives .
however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

however , if the polls are correct , and if the british election were to take place today , should all three parties win roughly 30 percent of the vote , britain 's house of commons would not have an even spread of politicians .
" if all the parties are around 30 percent , i would think that labour would probably come out as the largest party - narrowly - over the conservatives , with the liberal democrats having about 150 seats , " professor steven fielding , a political expert at the university of nottingham , told deutsche welle .
" because of our crazy system , it 's very difficult to be precise , but labour and the conservatives would probably win something upwards of 250 seats . "
so three parties separated by statistically insignificant sums in most opinion polls could easily end up with vastly different levels of representation in parliament .
bildunterschrift : nick clegg 's lib dems are on the rise , but will they really benefit from a greater share of the vote ?
the winner takes it all britain 's first-past-the-post system means the country 's election boils down to 650 individual skirmishes for the various constituencies around the country .
whichever party wins the most of these battles will have the most seats in parliament ; the national spread of voting - on which pollsters usually concentrate - is effectively irrelevant .
" we give the first-past-the-post system the nickname : ' the winner takes it all , ' says jared sonnicksen from the university of bonn .
" but you could just as well invert that and say ' the loser loses all . '
being in second place does n't help you at all , you 're the first loser . "
" because of how the system works , you have to win the constituency or you do n't get anything . "
britain 's liberal democrats are all too aware of this problem .
they are the second strongest party in many constituencies , but rarely strongest .
their voters are too evenly spread across the country , whereas the conservatives and labour have " strongholds " around the nation , as well as constituencies where they are never in the running .
not surprisingly , the liberal democrats have been calling for years for a proportional representation system - one in which parties are allocated seats according to their share of the national vote - but , equally unsurprisingly , they never get much support from their opponents who hold most of the parliamentary votes .
mixing it up germany tries to marry the first-past-the-post and proportional representation systems , using a " two-vote system . "
voters cast one ballot directly for the person they would like to be in charge of their constituency , and then a second vote for the party they favor overall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's system creates coalition governments , for better or worse directly elected candidates all go to parliament , filling roughly half of the available seats .
the remaining seats are split between all the parties in such a way as to make the overall balance in parliament representative of the complete public vote .
the only exception to this aggregate system affects fringe parties , who must attain a minimum of five percent of the overall vote to be eligible to be represented in parliament - unless one of their candidates is directly elected to represent a constituency .
this rule is designed to help safeguard against the biggest problem with proportionally representative voting , the danger of a fragmented , powerless parliament .
" the weakness of mixed election systems is an issue of accountability , " politics professor thomas gschwend from the university of mannheim explains .
" you vote for a particular party and after the election , in the negotiation round when they try to form coalitions , one party can blame the other for not doing something . "
" it 's much easier in the first-past-the-post system because the one that gets the majority usually runs a single party government .
change on the horizon ?
however , judging by current opinion polls in the uk , the first-past-the-post system might fail to deliver a strong parliament on may 6 .
the liberal democrats ' surge in popularity looks set to weaken the conservatives and labour to the extent that than neither may secure more than half of britain 's 650 parliamentary seats .
labour has already advocated a change towards an election system similar to germany 's in its manifesto , while the liberal democrats would prefer an even stronger move away from directly electing polticians , and most analysts expect that , in the case of a " hung parliament " -lrb- a system where no party has a parliamentary majority on its own -rrb- , these are the two parties most likely to form an alliance .
professor fielding from nottingham university believes the uk might be ready to modernize its voting system , which is one of the oldest in the world .
" the british system comes out of a time when the electorate was treated more like children than adults , " fielding said .

critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .
speaking to reporters after the match , bayern coach louis van gaal said he thought his team had a good shot at making it to the final in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulalan got two yellow cards in three minutes " we got a good result , " he said .
" in our previous matches , our first leg results were not as good and we went through anyway .
i always think we can score away from home , so i think we can go through . "
bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .
" at half-time we said that a goalless draw would be a good result , " he said .
" but when they went a man down we knew that we could get more . "

but they should n't underestimate their opponents .
-lrb- 20.04.2010 -rrb- love him or loathe him , bayern 's arjen robben is one of the best despite turning in top performances that enrich the bundesliga , bayern 's arjen robben is not beloved - much like his team .

-lrb- 16.04.2010 -rrb- after shaky start , bayern show dominant side to march on to semifinal again , bayern munich 's second half display against manchester united in their quarterfinal was one worthy of champions .

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .

due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .
" i know i have many critics , " ramsauer told lawmakers in the plenary hall of the reichstag building .
" but i warn against using purely party-political reasoning in interpreting the decisions taken during the crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter ramsauer defended his handling of the crisis the minister added it would have been gravely irresponsible not to impose the strictest possible flight bans in the face of a spreading plume of volcanic ash above much of europe and the lack of reliable scientific data concerning the impact of ash particles on jet engines .
he was aware , he said , of the huge economic damage that airlines and other businesses had incurred , but insisted that , even with the benefit of hindsight , he could see no alternative to the measures taken .
visual flight decision criticized opposition leaders expressed doubts about the minister 's efficiency in handling the crisis .
they could not understand why mr. ramsauer allowed some planes to take off as early as last saturday with visual flight rules applied , that is even before scientists here launched a special flight to measure the composition and density of volcanic ash particles in german skies .
opposition social democrat transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer criticized the fact that the minister had set up a crisis team at the german aviation control center at langen , near frankfurt , rather than calling the shots from berlin .
" this would have enabled mr. ramsauer to take better care of some important aspects of the crisis , " beckmeyer said .
" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "
handling the aftermath the transport minister announced that all german airlines must now report all cases of damage caused by ash particles to a special center at the federal aviation office .

authorities in germany 's 16 federal state are now considering the lifting of flight bans during nighttime to help passengers still stranded abroad return home more quickly .
christian democrat legislator dirk fischer said he hoped people living near german airports would show some understanding for such an emergency measure .

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .
" i know i have many critics , " ramsauer told lawmakers in the plenary hall of the reichstag building .
" but i warn against using purely party-political reasoning in interpreting the decisions taken during the crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter ramsauer defended his handling of the crisis the minister added it would have been gravely irresponsible not to impose the strictest possible flight bans in the face of a spreading plume of volcanic ash above much of europe and the lack of reliable scientific data concerning the impact of ash particles on jet engines .
he was aware , he said , of the huge economic damage that airlines and other businesses had incurred , but insisted that , even with the benefit of hindsight , he could see no alternative to the measures taken .
visual flight decision criticized opposition leaders expressed doubts about the minister 's efficiency in handling the crisis .
they could not understand why mr. ramsauer allowed some planes to take off as early as last saturday with visual flight rules applied , that is even before scientists here launched a special flight to measure the composition and density of volcanic ash particles in german skies .
opposition social democrat transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer criticized the fact that the minister had set up a crisis team at the german aviation control center at langen , near frankfurt , rather than calling the shots from berlin .
" this would have enabled mr. ramsauer to take better care of some important aspects of the crisis , " beckmeyer said .
" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "
handling the aftermath the transport minister announced that all german airlines must now report all cases of damage caused by ash particles to a special center at the federal aviation office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuhlsbuettel airport in hamburg braces for some louder nights also , inspection and maintenance routines should be carried out at shorter intervals in future .
authorities in germany 's 16 federal state are now considering the lifting of flight bans during nighttime to help passengers still stranded abroad return home more quickly .
christian democrat legislator dirk fischer said he hoped people living near german airports would show some understanding for such an emergency measure .
" the city-state of hamburg is leading the way , " fischer said .
" remarkably , its decision to let planes start and land also during nighttime is even backed by a senator from the green party which would n't normally support anything like this . "

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .

" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .

mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "

" greece had hoped it could continue to borrow money at a reasonable level from the international markets in order to maintain some sort of fiscal independence , " he said . athens would prefer this to going to its eurozone partners and the imf for debt rescue .
but the amounts the markets are currently charging greece to borrow money longterm - over eight percent for a ten-year-bond - are " simply unsustainable " , brabant said .
" this is black wednesday for greece . "
not much room to manoeuvre " there is no question of greece being left high and dry in may , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference on tuesday .
" either it will borrow from the markets or borrow from our partners . "
the eurozone members of the eu have earmarked a package of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.33 billion -rrb- should aid become necessary ; the imf has pledged about 15 billion euros .
talks with the eu commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund are currently underway in athens , where the government is trying to raise the 10 billion euros it needs to roll over debt , make bond interest payments totalling 8.5 billion euros , and finance its deficit in may .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a major contributer to the loan package the greek government has already implemented painful austerity measures , including public wage cuts , a pension freeze and tax hikes approval process the need for some european governments , including germany , to obtain approval from their parliaments could make it difficult for athens to tap the funds before the biggest part of the refinancing , an 8.5 billion euro bond , becomes due on may 19 .

" greece had hoped it could continue to borrow money at a reasonable level from the international markets in order to maintain some sort of fiscal independence , " he said . athens would prefer this to going to its eurozone partners and the imf for debt rescue .
but the amounts the markets are currently charging greece to borrow money longterm - over eight percent for a ten-year-bond - are " simply unsustainable " , brabant said .
" this is black wednesday for greece . "
not much room to manoeuvre " there is no question of greece being left high and dry in may , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference on tuesday .
" either it will borrow from the markets or borrow from our partners . "
the eurozone members of the eu have earmarked a package of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.33 billion -rrb- should aid become necessary ; the imf has pledged about 15 billion euros .
talks with the eu commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund are currently underway in athens , where the government is trying to raise the 10 billion euros it needs to roll over debt , make bond interest payments totalling 8.5 billion euros , and finance its deficit in may .

strike action in greece , the unions have launched two days of strikes .
the public sector is set to shut down on thursday for 24 hours , which is the civil servants ' fourth action this year . according to brabant , there is considerable potential for social unrest in the country as many greeks believe an aid deal would lead to a further deterioration of their living standards .
and many are worried about the involvement of the imf in the rescue package , brabant said . " they are concerned that they will really be hawkish in the way in which they demand that severe cuts are made in return for their contribution to this bailout package . "
austerity measures already in place were , he said , designed to fill government coffers .
but they seemed to be backfiring : " everybody is terrified of spending money , businesses are going bust , there 's no confidence on the streets ; this is a very depressed country and things only look as thought they are going to get worse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 21.04.2010 bayern shut out lyon in champions league semi-final first leg win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben was the hero again for bayern arjen robben 's lone goal was the difference in a match that saw two red cards and few scoring chances .
critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .
speaking to reporters after the match , bayern coach louis van gaal said he thought his team had a good shot at making it to the final in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulalan got two yellow cards in three minutes " we got a good result , " he said .
" in our previous matches , our first leg results were not as good and we went through anyway .
i always think we can score away from home , so i think we can go through . "
bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .

critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .
speaking to reporters after the match , bayern coach louis van gaal said he thought his team had a good shot at making it to the final in madrid .

bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .

and now time is beginning to run out . avatar was always going to be a big deal , but the german cinema landscape was quite unprepared for the mayhem and uncertainty it has left in its wake .
james cameron 's blockbuster came , was seen , and conquered the senses of a new generation of cinema-goers .
the word on the blogs is that 3d rocks and there is no way back .
but keeping pace with audience demands is easier said than done in germany , where cinemas have been rather ponderous in their willingness to embrace the technology it takes to screen the likes of avatar and alice in wonderland in all their three-dimensional glory .
a year ago , just 30 of the nation 's 4,000 plus screens were equipped with the technology necessary to run 3d flicks .
and although that number has now reached somewhere between five and six hundred , there are still a lot of old-school picture houses dotted about the country .
out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avatar was a game-changer as quaint as that scenario might sound , it is potentially very damaging to the cinema industry .
kai bartels , who runs a four-screen cinema in quickborn , a small town just north of hamburg , is all too aware of the need to move with the times .
" we screened avatar as a normal film and everyone who came to buy a ticket wanted to know if it was in 3d and where they could get their glasses , " bartels told deutsche welle .
" we lost out on that film . "
by contrast , the uci chain , which has more than 200 screens nationwide , some 40 of which are now equipped to show movies in 3d , reported a 13 percent increase in attendance levels last year .
spokesman thomas schulke says that surge in business is largely due to 3d films .
" all except one of our number one films this year have been 3d , " he said .
" there is a huge demand , people want a different viewing experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from alice in wonderland schulke believes that this time around , 3d is here to stay , and with companies such as dreamworks dedicating their entire 2010 production slate to three-dimensional pictures , he could well be right .
strapped for cash in the country so why , in that case , are n't there more german cinemas making the transition necessary to secure them a piece of the juicy new pie ?
jasko jochenhoevel , academic assistant at the potsdam film and television academy , says it is simply a question of money .
" a digital projector costs somewhere in the realm of 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 107,000 -rrb- , and then another 30,000 on top to make it 3d compatible , " jochenhoevel said .

and therein lies a potentially devastating problem .
because keeping up with the times is not only about being able to screen the latest 3d releases , it is about becoming digital per se .
cinemas that can only play analogue films will ultimately be nudged out of the listings , whether they run arthouse or more commercial programs .
" digitial is the future , that 's a fact , " bartels said .
" there will come a time when distributors only work with digital copies .
it could be in two or in five years , but that moment will come . "
every cinema for itself when it does , bartels wants to be ready , so has begun looking at ways to make it happen .
essentially that means taking out a loan , because despite good intentions on the part of german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , no money has been made available to ease the path to the far side of the digital divide .
" we 've always been told -lsb- funding -rsb- will come , but it has n't so far and just sitting around waiting is too dangerous in this competitive climate , " bartels said .
the ffa first began drawing up plans for a comprehensive digitalization concept four years ago .
the initial idea was that cinema operators , distributors , film funding bodies and the government would put a total of 280 million euros into a " solidarity fund " from which cinemas nationwide would have been entitled to draw .
but the fund became overshadowed by an ongoing battle between some movie theaters and the ffa over screening fees , and subsequently never made it beyond the planning stages .

and now time is beginning to run out . avatar was always going to be a big deal , but the german cinema landscape was quite unprepared for the mayhem and uncertainty it has left in its wake .
james cameron 's blockbuster came , was seen , and conquered the senses of a new generation of cinema-goers .
the word on the blogs is that 3d rocks and there is no way back .
but keeping pace with audience demands is easier said than done in germany , where cinemas have been rather ponderous in their willingness to embrace the technology it takes to screen the likes of avatar and alice in wonderland in all their three-dimensional glory .
a year ago , just 30 of the nation 's 4,000 plus screens were equipped with the technology necessary to run 3d flicks .
and although that number has now reached somewhere between five and six hundred , there are still a lot of old-school picture houses dotted about the country .
out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avatar was a game-changer as quaint as that scenario might sound , it is potentially very damaging to the cinema industry .
kai bartels , who runs a four-screen cinema in quickborn , a small town just north of hamburg , is all too aware of the need to move with the times .
" we screened avatar as a normal film and everyone who came to buy a ticket wanted to know if it was in 3d and where they could get their glasses , " bartels told deutsche welle .
" we lost out on that film . "
by contrast , the uci chain , which has more than 200 screens nationwide , some 40 of which are now equipped to show movies in 3d , reported a 13 percent increase in attendance levels last year .
spokesman thomas schulke says that surge in business is largely due to 3d films .
" all except one of our number one films this year have been 3d , " he said .
" there is a huge demand , people want a different viewing experience . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from alice in wonderland schulke believes that this time around , 3d is here to stay , and with companies such as dreamworks dedicating their entire 2010 production slate to three-dimensional pictures , he could well be right .
strapped for cash in the country so why , in that case , are n't there more german cinemas making the transition necessary to secure them a piece of the juicy new pie ?
jasko jochenhoevel , academic assistant at the potsdam film and television academy , says it is simply a question of money .
" a digital projector costs somewhere in the realm of 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 107,000 -rrb- , and then another 30,000 on top to make it 3d compatible , " jochenhoevel said .
“ and a lot of smaller cinemas just ca n't afford it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of small town cinemas ?
and therein lies a potentially devastating problem .
because keeping up with the times is not only about being able to screen the latest 3d releases , it is about becoming digital per se .
cinemas that can only play analogue films will ultimately be nudged out of the listings , whether they run arthouse or more commercial programs .
" digitial is the future , that 's a fact , " bartels said .
" there will come a time when distributors only work with digital copies .
it could be in two or in five years , but that moment will come . "
every cinema for itself when it does , bartels wants to be ready , so has begun looking at ways to make it happen .
essentially that means taking out a loan , because despite good intentions on the part of german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , no money has been made available to ease the path to the far side of the digital divide .
" we 've always been told -lsb- funding -rsb- will come , but it has n't so far and just sitting around waiting is too dangerous in this competitive climate , " bartels said .
the ffa first began drawing up plans for a comprehensive digitalization concept four years ago .
the initial idea was that cinema operators , distributors , film funding bodies and the government would put a total of 280 million euros into a " solidarity fund " from which cinemas nationwide would have been entitled to draw .
but the fund became overshadowed by an ongoing battle between some movie theaters and the ffa over screening fees , and subsequently never made it beyond the planning stages .
bildunterschrift : a larger than life , 3d version of shrek is due to hit the screens this year further efforts to come up with a new concept have also failed , and although a spokesman for the ffa told deutsche welle that there are new ideas in the pipeline , they are still a long way from becoming reality .
" we are all hoping , all waiting , but nobody knows when it -lsb- the fund -rsb- will come , " the spokesman said .
in the meantime , the larger cinemas have taken it upon themselves to go digital , and given their huge seating capacities , the surcharge on 3d tickets and their competitive advantage , they are in a good position .
it stands to reason that they 're not keen to share the new and highly lucrative market with everyone else .
and if a deal can not be struck at some point in the relatively near future , they might not have to . author : tamsin walker editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 21.04.2010 built on sand : masdar city to become eco-city of the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of the future : artist 's vision of masdar in abu dhabi no co2 , no waste , no cars : the emirate of abu dhabi is building the world 's first sustainable city in the middle of the desert .
masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .
" i know i have many critics , " ramsauer told lawmakers in the plenary hall of the reichstag building .
" but i warn against using purely party-political reasoning in interpreting the decisions taken during the crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter ramsauer defended his handling of the crisis the minister added it would have been gravely irresponsible not to impose the strictest possible flight bans in the face of a spreading plume of volcanic ash above much of europe and the lack of reliable scientific data concerning the impact of ash particles on jet engines .
he was aware , he said , of the huge economic damage that airlines and other businesses had incurred , but insisted that , even with the benefit of hindsight , he could see no alternative to the measures taken .
visual flight decision criticized opposition leaders expressed doubts about the minister 's efficiency in handling the crisis .
they could not understand why mr. ramsauer allowed some planes to take off as early as last saturday with visual flight rules applied , that is even before scientists here launched a special flight to measure the composition and density of volcanic ash particles in german skies .
opposition social democrat transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer criticized the fact that the minister had set up a crisis team at the german aviation control center at langen , near frankfurt , rather than calling the shots from berlin .
" this would have enabled mr. ramsauer to take better care of some important aspects of the crisis , " beckmeyer said .
" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "
handling the aftermath the transport minister announced that all german airlines must now report all cases of damage caused by ash particles to a special center at the federal aviation office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuhlsbuettel airport in hamburg braces for some louder nights also , inspection and maintenance routines should be carried out at shorter intervals in future .
authorities in germany 's 16 federal state are now considering the lifting of flight bans during nighttime to help passengers still stranded abroad return home more quickly .
christian democrat legislator dirk fischer said he hoped people living near german airports would show some understanding for such an emergency measure .
" the city-state of hamburg is leading the way , " fischer said .
" remarkably , its decision to let planes start and land also during nighttime is even backed by a senator from the green party which would n't normally support anything like this . "

we based our selection on certain statistical facts and figures , and we 'd like to share these with you . according to the federal statistics office , germany was home to 82 million people in 2008 .
a majority of 42 million are female , and a majority of 75 million have a german passport . roughly one fifth have a foreign background , i.e. : they themselves , their parents or their grandparents moved to germany from abroad .
less then 10 percent of people living in germany have foreign citizenship . 43 million people in germany are eligible to work , 10 percent of whom are self-employed .
36 million people are employees .

" ultimately i believe that security for our forces and for afghanistan come from the people of afghanistan , " mcchrystal said .
" so our ability to protect them and to partner with them and their forces is really the best way ahead for our entire strategy .
and it 's critical . "
mcchrystal praised german troops for their work in the north of afghanistan , adding that the bundeswehr deployment to the troubled country had met with " great success . "
he said germany " remains a very important partner for our work in afghanistan , " and that 2010 would be a " critical year " in efforts to stabilize the country .
international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and afghan troops increasingly carry out joint operations - a strategy that is viewed with skepticism in germany after four german soldiers were killed in such an operation last week .
the new strategy is now also forcing german troops to leave their bases in northern afghanistan and , together with afghan forces , fight the taliban insurgency in rural regions .
new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's troop presence in afghanistan is to continue defense minister guttenberg said such sacrifices would have to be made if isaf was to pull out by 2012 .
" the new strategy is as dangerous and risky as the entire afghanistan mission , " he said .
" yet there 's no denying that the concept of partnering has the potential to create the type of trust and collaboration between the afghan forces and the population at large that is the basis for a withdrawal . "
guttenberg also confirmed that germany would continue operating in a position of leadership in afghanistan , adding that berlin remained committed to the mission despite dwindling public support at home .
" we want to continue with our responsibility of leading as we have been doing , " he said , adding that everything would be done " to guarantee the best possible protection and the best possible equipment " for german troops .
earlier in the day , guttenberg and mcchrystal laid wreaths at a german armed forces memorial at the defense ministry in memory of the four bundeswehr soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .
43 german soldiers have died so far during the afghanistan mission .
with over 4,000 troops , germany has the third largest military contingent in afghanistan behind the united states and great britain. dfm / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .
" i know i have many critics , " ramsauer told lawmakers in the plenary hall of the reichstag building .
" but i warn against using purely party-political reasoning in interpreting the decisions taken during the crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter ramsauer defended his handling of the crisis the minister added it would have been gravely irresponsible not to impose the strictest possible flight bans in the face of a spreading plume of volcanic ash above much of europe and the lack of reliable scientific data concerning the impact of ash particles on jet engines .
he was aware , he said , of the huge economic damage that airlines and other businesses had incurred , but insisted that , even with the benefit of hindsight , he could see no alternative to the measures taken .
visual flight decision criticized opposition leaders expressed doubts about the minister 's efficiency in handling the crisis .
they could not understand why mr. ramsauer allowed some planes to take off as early as last saturday with visual flight rules applied , that is even before scientists here launched a special flight to measure the composition and density of volcanic ash particles in german skies .
opposition social democrat transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer criticized the fact that the minister had set up a crisis team at the german aviation control center at langen , near frankfurt , rather than calling the shots from berlin .
" this would have enabled mr. ramsauer to take better care of some important aspects of the crisis , " beckmeyer said .
" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "
handling the aftermath the transport minister announced that all german airlines must now report all cases of damage caused by ash particles to a special center at the federal aviation office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuhlsbuettel airport in hamburg braces for some louder nights also , inspection and maintenance routines should be carried out at shorter intervals in future .
authorities in germany 's 16 federal state are now considering the lifting of flight bans during nighttime to help passengers still stranded abroad return home more quickly .
christian democrat legislator dirk fischer said he hoped people living near german airports would show some understanding for such an emergency measure .
" the city-state of hamburg is leading the way , " fischer said .
" remarkably , its decision to let planes start and land also during nighttime is even backed by a senator from the green party which would n't normally support anything like this . "

masdar city should be ready to welcome some 50,000 residents by 2016 . what does it cost to build a truly futuristic city ?
the answer : $ 22 billion , or 16.4 billion euros .
divide that by 50,000 residents , and you have a per capita cost of $ 440,000 .
that 's how much abu dhabi is forking out to build masdar city , the world 's first carbon-neutral eco-city in the midst of the emirate 's inhospitable desert terrain .
but abu dhabi , the world 's sixth-largest oil exporter , is not bearing the cost alone .
due to masdar city 's climate-saving concept , the construction costs are being offset by the sale of emissions certificates , as regulated under the kyoto protocol .
the city is set to become home to a population of 50,000 in 2016 .
and despite the extreme conditions of the desert location , residents will be afforded all manner of modern comforts that design and technology can provide .
bildunterschrift : masdar city will be home to a center for cutting-edge technology , to inspire other cities to implement some of its climate-friendly concepts " the aim is for its residents to enjoy the highest quality of life , happy in the knowledge that they are making the lowest possible environmental impact , " says the narrator of an image film produced by foster and partner , the main architecture company in charge of the project .
british star architect lord norman foster 's company is working with around 500 partners from around the world to build the high-tech city .
his team has also brought consultants such as razan al-mubarak , managing director of the emirates wildlife society , on board .
a dream come true " we 're making a dream come true , " she said .
" we all want the best quality of life , we want to protect the environment , and we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy planet .
masdar city is based on 10 principles which , when it comes to sustainability , are often neglected : fair trade , health , happiness , respect for local traditions and culture , for example .
this is the foundation upon which masdar city is being built . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e-vehicles will be part of a dense transportation network doing away with the need for personal cars with 80 percent less water consumption than conventional cities , 100 percent waste recycling , and zero percent co2 emissions , there is definitely something dream-like about masdar city .
as in traditional arab cities , the streets will be narrow so buildings will shade each other .
there wo n't be any impact on traffic , as the streets are designed for pedestrians .
the whole city is to be car-free .
a dense network of metro stations and electronic vehicles on tracks will ensure that transportation modes are separated by no more than 200 meters .
power to come solely from renewables buildings , parks , and water plants will make use of clever architectural design elements to keep the desert city cool and comfortable .
all the energy consumed in the city will come from solar and wind energy plants , and any excess energy produced will be fed into the grid to power other cities .
the designers seem to have thought of everything - including an economic base , says sultan al-jaber , managing director and ceo of masdar .
" masdar will attract companies from all over the world , as well as banks , investment firms , and companies that want to do research and development here , " he said .
" masdar city is quite simply the solution for the whole value added chain in the renewable energy sector . "
in addition to an ultra-modern technology center , which is being built in cooperation with the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , the international renewable energy agency -lrb- irena -rrb- will also have its headquarters in masdar city .
the futuristic vision of the world 's leading researchers is currently being created in the desert , and even if the concept behind masdar ca n't be implemented one-to-one in other places , the founders of this forward-looking laboratory guarantee that their city will make technological breakthroughs that can be replicated elsewhere .
or , as the image film concludes : " one day , all cities will be built like this . "

critically , bayern now head into the return leg in lyon next week without having given up an away goal . both teams finished the game on wednesday with 10 players on the field , after italian referee roberto rosetti showed bayern 's franck ribery a straight red card in the 37th minute for an reckless tackle on lyon forward lisandro lopez that missed the ball and got all of his ankle .
lyon later lost jeremy toulalan early in the second half after toulalan committed two bookable offenses within three minutes .
the result is good news for bayern munich , who managed to keep their opponents from scoring a precious away goal in the first leg of the semi-final match .
speaking to reporters after the match , bayern coach louis van gaal said he thought his team had a good shot at making it to the final in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulalan got two yellow cards in three minutes " we got a good result , " he said .
" in our previous matches , our first leg results were not as good and we went through anyway .
i always think we can score away from home , so i think we can go through . "
bayern ' knew that we could get more ' bayern went into the match as the favorites , and early shots from bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller and croatian danijel pranjic showed off the team 's aggression .
pranjic will not be returning for bayern 's away leg after being booked .
it was not until the 69th minute , however that the deadlock was broken .
arjen robben cut inside from the right wing and unleashed a shot from 25 meters out that took a slight a deflection off of his teammate mueller .
the dutchman told reporters the expulsion of toulalan had changed his team 's aspirations .
" at half-time we said that a goalless draw would be a good result , " he said .
" but when they went a man down we knew that we could get more . "

but opposition leaders have called his crisis management inadequate . following the lifting of flight bans in germany , transport minister peter ramsauer told the national parliament in berlin that handling an aviation crisis caused by volcanic ash had been an unprecedented experience .
the conservative politician from bavaria said there was little he could have done differently , given that the security of passengers had remained his top priority .
" i know i have many critics , " ramsauer told lawmakers in the plenary hall of the reichstag building .
" but i warn against using purely party-political reasoning in interpreting the decisions taken during the crisis . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter ramsauer defended his handling of the crisis the minister added it would have been gravely irresponsible not to impose the strictest possible flight bans in the face of a spreading plume of volcanic ash above much of europe and the lack of reliable scientific data concerning the impact of ash particles on jet engines .
he was aware , he said , of the huge economic damage that airlines and other businesses had incurred , but insisted that , even with the benefit of hindsight , he could see no alternative to the measures taken .
visual flight decision criticized opposition leaders expressed doubts about the minister 's efficiency in handling the crisis .
they could not understand why mr. ramsauer allowed some planes to take off as early as last saturday with visual flight rules applied , that is even before scientists here launched a special flight to measure the composition and density of volcanic ash particles in german skies .
opposition social democrat transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer criticized the fact that the minister had set up a crisis team at the german aviation control center at langen , near frankfurt , rather than calling the shots from berlin .
" this would have enabled mr. ramsauer to take better care of some important aspects of the crisis , " beckmeyer said .
" instead , we saw airlines in financial trouble knocking on the door of the economics ministry while everything should have been dealt with from a single place . "
handling the aftermath the transport minister announced that all german airlines must now report all cases of damage caused by ash particles to a special center at the federal aviation office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuhlsbuettel airport in hamburg braces for some louder nights also , inspection and maintenance routines should be carried out at shorter intervals in future .
authorities in germany 's 16 federal state are now considering the lifting of flight bans during nighttime to help passengers still stranded abroad return home more quickly .
christian democrat legislator dirk fischer said he hoped people living near german airports would show some understanding for such an emergency measure .
" the city-state of hamburg is leading the way , " fischer said .
" remarkably , its decision to let planes start and land also during nighttime is even backed by a senator from the green party which would n't normally support anything like this . "
