ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .
bildunterschrift : forlan , left , scores a goal past germany goalkeeper joerg butt sidelined stars germany went into the game with a slew of sidelined top players .
watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .
in germany 's goal , manuel neuer was replaced by joerg butt .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .

he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .

it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .

perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .

the ministry has promised to stand firm when eu interior ministers meet to discuss the proposals later this week . a european commission aim to standardize asylum rules across europe by 2012 has prompted fears that german asylum law would be significantly weakened .
germany 's ministry of the interior has said it will oppose some of the proposed changes to set minimum standards for the treatment of asylum seekers .
" the plans of the commission for an eu asylum law will lead to longer asylum proceedings and higher costs , " ole schroeder , the ministry 's parliamentary state secretary , told germany 's mass-circulation daily bild on friday .
the ministry of the interior said that while it was generally in favor of harmonization plans , it had concerns about details of the law . schroeder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said germany would resist aspects of the proposed law when eu interior ministers meet to discuss it in brussels on thursday .
" in brussels , the government will fight so that the core of our proven asylum law is not infringed upon , " said schroeder .
prevent the deportation of minors according to the commission , each eu country should decide upon asylum applications within six months , with an extension up to one year in complicated cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission wants each country to decide on asylum applications within six months it also plans to prevent the deportation of minors whose siblings are in the process of claiming asylum along with their minor siblings .
opposition was also voiced by alexander dobrindt , general secretary of the csu , the cdu 's bavarian sister party .
he told the german newspaper muenchener merkur on friday that europe would not be allowed to water down german asylum law .
the european commission denied reports in bild that germany would lose its ability to deport asylum seekers whose applications held no merit on arrival at german airports .
bild had also said that member states would be forced to give asylum seekers the same welfare rights as their own citizens , a claim that was also denied by the commission .
" there is no question of the core of german asylum law being infringed upon or the door being opened to bogus asylum seekers , " said a commission spokesman on friday .
' cheap populism ' criticism of the proposals was condemned as " cheap populism " by karl kopp , european expert for the refugee organization pro asyl .
he told the suddeutsche zeitung on friday that the commission aimed to introduce minimum standards for asylum procedures and conditions .
" in some countries , asylum seekers get their own apartment , " said kopp .
" in others they are homeless and do n't even have a bed .
that must change . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2010 texan sorbs travel to germany in search of ancestral roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigersdorf church offered the visitors an insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs a group of texan visitors , descendants of the slavic minority , the sorbs , recently traveled through eastern germany in an attempt to see for themselves where their ancestors come from . bob boyce , a retired pastor from texas , recently organized a bus tour through eastern germany for his fellow americans from the southern us state .
it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2010 texan sorbs travel to germany in search of ancestral roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigersdorf church offered the visitors an insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs a group of texan visitors , descendants of the slavic minority , the sorbs , recently traveled through eastern germany in an attempt to see for themselves where their ancestors come from . bob boyce , a retired pastor from texas , recently organized a bus tour through eastern germany for his fellow americans from the southern us state .
it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .

with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .

a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

" croatia sends a positive message to all countries aspiring to join the european family , " kosor said , stressing that the government was strongly supporting croatia 's membership bid . the integration of the balkan region , which was torn apart when yugoslavia was split up in the 1990s , would " strengthen the security of european territory , " she said . " all of us here are striving to the same goal - eventual integration of southeastern european countries in the euro-atlantic political and security framework , " kosor added . eu president herman van rompuy said this week that croatia 's eu entry would send a positive signal to the region by proving that accession to the eu is attainable . croatia would be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu since slovenia in 2004 . fast-track membership talks the croation government hopes to conclude membership talks with brussels by the end of the year and become a full-fledged eu member by 2012 . french premier francois fillon told the summit he believed that the future for balkan countries lay in being a part of the eu . but he stressed that countries wishing to join the eu needed to undergo " deep transformations .

bulgaria 's prime minister boyko borisov , poland 's pm donald tusk and slovenia 's pm borut pahor also attended the meeting .
other participants included albanian prime minister sali berisha , his kosovo counterpart hashim thaci , eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele and several nato officials .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , however , pulled out at the last moment .
conspicuous absence serbia was also not represented at the meeting , boycotting the summit to protest the presence of representatives from kosovo .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 , a move recognized by the united states and 22 eu member states .
spain and four other european union states were urged thursday to drop their opposition to kosovo 's independence by the european parliament .
kosovo is meant to be integrated into the european union like all other balkan states , but the process has been hindered by the refusal of spain , slovakia , romania , greece and cyprus to recognize its independence .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .

" croatia sends a positive message to all countries aspiring to join the european family , " kosor said , stressing that the government was strongly supporting croatia 's membership bid . the integration of the balkan region , which was torn apart when yugoslavia was split up in the 1990s , would " strengthen the security of european territory , " she said . " all of us here are striving to the same goal - eventual integration of southeastern european countries in the euro-atlantic political and security framework , " kosor added . eu president herman van rompuy said this week that croatia 's eu entry would send a positive signal to the region by proving that accession to the eu is attainable . croatia would be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu since slovenia in 2004 . fast-track membership talks the croation government hopes to conclude membership talks with brussels by the end of the year and become a full-fledged eu member by 2012 . french premier francois fillon told the summit he believed that the future for balkan countries lay in being a part of the eu . but he stressed that countries wishing to join the eu needed to undergo " deep transformations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said deep transformations were needed croatian president ivo josipovic said that eu membership would " determine the development of this part of the world in a permanent and key way . "
" both eu and this gathering should send a clear message that there is place in the eu for all southeastern european countries - it is a message of optimism , encouragement , " josipovic said .
bulgaria 's prime minister boyko borisov , poland 's pm donald tusk and slovenia 's pm borut pahor also attended the meeting .
other participants included albanian prime minister sali berisha , his kosovo counterpart hashim thaci , eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele and several nato officials .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , however , pulled out at the last moment .
conspicuous absence serbia was also not represented at the meeting , boycotting the summit to protest the presence of representatives from kosovo .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 , a move recognized by the united states and 22 eu member states .
spain and four other european union states were urged thursday to drop their opposition to kosovo 's independence by the european parliament .
kosovo is meant to be integrated into the european union like all other balkan states , but the process has been hindered by the refusal of spain , slovakia , romania , greece and cyprus to recognize its independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2010 texan sorbs travel to germany in search of ancestral roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigersdorf church offered the visitors an insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs a group of texan visitors , descendants of the slavic minority , the sorbs , recently traveled through eastern germany in an attempt to see for themselves where their ancestors come from . bob boyce , a retired pastor from texas , recently organized a bus tour through eastern germany for his fellow americans from the southern us state .
it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .

with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .
in germany 's goal , manuel neuer was replaced by joerg butt .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .

a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .

it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?

the ministry has promised to stand firm when eu interior ministers meet to discuss the proposals later this week . a european commission aim to standardize asylum rules across europe by 2012 has prompted fears that german asylum law would be significantly weakened .
germany 's ministry of the interior has said it will oppose some of the proposed changes to set minimum standards for the treatment of asylum seekers .
" the plans of the commission for an eu asylum law will lead to longer asylum proceedings and higher costs , " ole schroeder , the ministry 's parliamentary state secretary , told germany 's mass-circulation daily bild on friday .
the ministry of the interior said that while it was generally in favor of harmonization plans , it had concerns about details of the law . schroeder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said germany would resist aspects of the proposed law when eu interior ministers meet to discuss it in brussels on thursday .
" in brussels , the government will fight so that the core of our proven asylum law is not infringed upon , " said schroeder .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission wants each country to decide on asylum applications within six months it also plans to prevent the deportation of minors whose siblings are in the process of claiming asylum along with their minor siblings .
opposition was also voiced by alexander dobrindt , general secretary of the csu , the cdu 's bavarian sister party .
he told the german newspaper muenchener merkur on friday that europe would not be allowed to water down german asylum law .
the european commission denied reports in bild that germany would lose its ability to deport asylum seekers whose applications held no merit on arrival at german airports .
bild had also said that member states would be forced to give asylum seekers the same welfare rights as their own citizens , a claim that was also denied by the commission .
" there is no question of the core of german asylum law being infringed upon or the door being opened to bogus asylum seekers , " said a commission spokesman on friday .
' cheap populism ' criticism of the proposals was condemned as " cheap populism " by karl kopp , european expert for the refugee organization pro asyl .
he told the suddeutsche zeitung on friday that the commission aimed to introduce minimum standards for asylum procedures and conditions .
" in some countries , asylum seekers get their own apartment , " said kopp .
" in others they are homeless and do n't even have a bed .
that must change . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 10.07.2010 klose , lahm to sit out germany 's third-place match against uruguay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defensive midfield star schweinsteiger will be on the pitch for the uruguay game third place is hardly the prize joachim loew and his team were hoping to take home , but saturday 's game could be a useful test of the team 's depth moving forward .
but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.07.2010 france , germany push for financial transaction tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say the tax could help debt-laden governments despite being rejected by the g20 , france and germany are pressing for a discussion at the next meeting of eu finance ministers on plans to introduce a tax on financial transactions in europe . in a joint letter to the belgian presidency of the european union , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his french counterpart christine lagarde have called on fellow eu members to proceed with the idea of the transaction tax among themselves .
" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

" croatia sends a positive message to all countries aspiring to join the european family , " kosor said , stressing that the government was strongly supporting croatia 's membership bid . the integration of the balkan region , which was torn apart when yugoslavia was split up in the 1990s , would " strengthen the security of european territory , " she said . " all of us here are striving to the same goal - eventual integration of southeastern european countries in the euro-atlantic political and security framework , " kosor added . eu president herman van rompuy said this week that croatia 's eu entry would send a positive signal to the region by proving that accession to the eu is attainable . croatia would be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu since slovenia in 2004 . fast-track membership talks the croation government hopes to conclude membership talks with brussels by the end of the year and become a full-fledged eu member by 2012 . french premier francois fillon told the summit he believed that the future for balkan countries lay in being a part of the eu . but he stressed that countries wishing to join the eu needed to undergo " deep transformations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said deep transformations were needed croatian president ivo josipovic said that eu membership would " determine the development of this part of the world in a permanent and key way . "
" both eu and this gathering should send a clear message that there is place in the eu for all southeastern european countries - it is a message of optimism , encouragement , " josipovic said .
bulgaria 's prime minister boyko borisov , poland 's pm donald tusk and slovenia 's pm borut pahor also attended the meeting .
other participants included albanian prime minister sali berisha , his kosovo counterpart hashim thaci , eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele and several nato officials .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , however , pulled out at the last moment .
conspicuous absence serbia was also not represented at the meeting , boycotting the summit to protest the presence of representatives from kosovo .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 , a move recognized by the united states and 22 eu member states .
spain and four other european union states were urged thursday to drop their opposition to kosovo 's independence by the european parliament .
kosovo is meant to be integrated into the european union like all other balkan states , but the process has been hindered by the refusal of spain , slovakia , romania , greece and cyprus to recognize its independence .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .

defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .
in germany 's goal , manuel neuer was replaced by joerg butt .
defender dennis aogo made his world cup debut on saturday .
in sunday ’ s final match at johannesburg 's soccer city stadium , an estimated 500 million viewers from around the world will watch spain and the netherlands battle it out for the world cup title .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .

" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .

britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.07.2010 france , germany push for financial transaction tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say the tax could help debt-laden governments despite being rejected by the g20 , france and germany are pressing for a discussion at the next meeting of eu finance ministers on plans to introduce a tax on financial transactions in europe . in a joint letter to the belgian presidency of the european union , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his french counterpart christine lagarde have called on fellow eu members to proceed with the idea of the transaction tax among themselves .
" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .

kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry has promised to stand firm when eu interior ministers meet to discuss the proposals later this week . a european commission aim to standardize asylum rules across europe by 2012 has prompted fears that german asylum law would be significantly weakened .
germany 's ministry of the interior has said it will oppose some of the proposed changes to set minimum standards for the treatment of asylum seekers .
" the plans of the commission for an eu asylum law will lead to longer asylum proceedings and higher costs , " ole schroeder , the ministry 's parliamentary state secretary , told germany 's mass-circulation daily bild on friday .
the ministry of the interior said that while it was generally in favor of harmonization plans , it had concerns about details of the law . schroeder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said germany would resist aspects of the proposed law when eu interior ministers meet to discuss it in brussels on thursday .
" in brussels , the government will fight so that the core of our proven asylum law is not infringed upon , " said schroeder .

opposition was also voiced by alexander dobrindt , general secretary of the csu , the cdu 's bavarian sister party .
he told the german newspaper muenchener merkur on friday that europe would not be allowed to water down german asylum law .
the european commission denied reports in bild that germany would lose its ability to deport asylum seekers whose applications held no merit on arrival at german airports .
bild had also said that member states would be forced to give asylum seekers the same welfare rights as their own citizens , a claim that was also denied by the commission .
" there is no question of the core of german asylum law being infringed upon or the door being opened to bogus asylum seekers , " said a commission spokesman on friday .
' cheap populism ' criticism of the proposals was condemned as " cheap populism " by karl kopp , european expert for the refugee organization pro asyl .
he told the suddeutsche zeitung on friday that the commission aimed to introduce minimum standards for asylum procedures and conditions .
" in some countries , asylum seekers get their own apartment , " said kopp .
" in others they are homeless and do n't even have a bed .
that must change . "

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.07.2010 france , germany push for financial transaction tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say the tax could help debt-laden governments despite being rejected by the g20 , france and germany are pressing for a discussion at the next meeting of eu finance ministers on plans to introduce a tax on financial transactions in europe . in a joint letter to the belgian presidency of the european union , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his french counterpart christine lagarde have called on fellow eu members to proceed with the idea of the transaction tax among themselves .
" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 10.07.2010 van marwijk the unassuming architect of dutch surge to the final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van marwijk may be about to add the world cup to his cv the dutch have a star-studded team but the world cup finalists ' coach is hardly a household name - and that 's the way he likes it .
so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .
bildunterschrift : forlan , left , scores a goal past germany goalkeeper joerg butt sidelined stars germany went into the game with a slew of sidelined top players .
watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .
in germany 's goal , manuel neuer was replaced by joerg butt .
defender dennis aogo made his world cup debut on saturday .
in sunday ’ s final match at johannesburg 's soccer city stadium , an estimated 500 million viewers from around the world will watch spain and the netherlands battle it out for the world cup title .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .
bildunterschrift : forlan , left , scores a goal past germany goalkeeper joerg butt sidelined stars germany went into the game with a slew of sidelined top players .
watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .
in germany 's goal , manuel neuer was replaced by joerg butt .
defender dennis aogo made his world cup debut on saturday .
in sunday ’ s final match at johannesburg 's soccer city stadium , an estimated 500 million viewers from around the world will watch spain and the netherlands battle it out for the world cup title .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .

" croatia sends a positive message to all countries aspiring to join the european family , " kosor said , stressing that the government was strongly supporting croatia 's membership bid . the integration of the balkan region , which was torn apart when yugoslavia was split up in the 1990s , would " strengthen the security of european territory , " she said . " all of us here are striving to the same goal - eventual integration of southeastern european countries in the euro-atlantic political and security framework , " kosor added . eu president herman van rompuy said this week that croatia 's eu entry would send a positive signal to the region by proving that accession to the eu is attainable . croatia would be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu since slovenia in 2004 . fast-track membership talks the croation government hopes to conclude membership talks with brussels by the end of the year and become a full-fledged eu member by 2012 . french premier francois fillon told the summit he believed that the future for balkan countries lay in being a part of the eu . but he stressed that countries wishing to join the eu needed to undergo " deep transformations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said deep transformations were needed croatian president ivo josipovic said that eu membership would " determine the development of this part of the world in a permanent and key way . "
" both eu and this gathering should send a clear message that there is place in the eu for all southeastern european countries - it is a message of optimism , encouragement , " josipovic said .
bulgaria 's prime minister boyko borisov , poland 's pm donald tusk and slovenia 's pm borut pahor also attended the meeting .
other participants included albanian prime minister sali berisha , his kosovo counterpart hashim thaci , eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele and several nato officials .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , however , pulled out at the last moment .
conspicuous absence serbia was also not represented at the meeting , boycotting the summit to protest the presence of representatives from kosovo .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 , a move recognized by the united states and 22 eu member states .
spain and four other european union states were urged thursday to drop their opposition to kosovo 's independence by the european parliament .
kosovo is meant to be integrated into the european union like all other balkan states , but the process has been hindered by the refusal of spain , slovakia , romania , greece and cyprus to recognize its independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2010 texan sorbs travel to germany in search of ancestral roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigersdorf church offered the visitors an insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs a group of texan visitors , descendants of the slavic minority , the sorbs , recently traveled through eastern germany in an attempt to see for themselves where their ancestors come from . bob boyce , a retired pastor from texas , recently organized a bus tour through eastern germany for his fellow americans from the southern us state .
it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry has promised to stand firm when eu interior ministers meet to discuss the proposals later this week . a european commission aim to standardize asylum rules across europe by 2012 has prompted fears that german asylum law would be significantly weakened .
germany 's ministry of the interior has said it will oppose some of the proposed changes to set minimum standards for the treatment of asylum seekers .
" the plans of the commission for an eu asylum law will lead to longer asylum proceedings and higher costs , " ole schroeder , the ministry 's parliamentary state secretary , told germany 's mass-circulation daily bild on friday .
the ministry of the interior said that while it was generally in favor of harmonization plans , it had concerns about details of the law . schroeder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said germany would resist aspects of the proposed law when eu interior ministers meet to discuss it in brussels on thursday .
" in brussels , the government will fight so that the core of our proven asylum law is not infringed upon , " said schroeder .
prevent the deportation of minors according to the commission , each eu country should decide upon asylum applications within six months , with an extension up to one year in complicated cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission wants each country to decide on asylum applications within six months it also plans to prevent the deportation of minors whose siblings are in the process of claiming asylum along with their minor siblings .
opposition was also voiced by alexander dobrindt , general secretary of the csu , the cdu 's bavarian sister party .
he told the german newspaper muenchener merkur on friday that europe would not be allowed to water down german asylum law .
the european commission denied reports in bild that germany would lose its ability to deport asylum seekers whose applications held no merit on arrival at german airports .
bild had also said that member states would be forced to give asylum seekers the same welfare rights as their own citizens , a claim that was also denied by the commission .
" there is no question of the core of german asylum law being infringed upon or the door being opened to bogus asylum seekers , " said a commission spokesman on friday .
' cheap populism ' criticism of the proposals was condemned as " cheap populism " by karl kopp , european expert for the refugee organization pro asyl .
he told the suddeutsche zeitung on friday that the commission aimed to introduce minimum standards for asylum procedures and conditions .
" in some countries , asylum seekers get their own apartment , " said kopp .
" in others they are homeless and do n't even have a bed .
that must change . "

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 10.07.2010 klose , lahm to sit out germany 's third-place match against uruguay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defensive midfield star schweinsteiger will be on the pitch for the uruguay game third place is hardly the prize joachim loew and his team were hoping to take home , but saturday 's game could be a useful test of the team 's depth moving forward .
but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .

" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .

britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .
bildunterschrift : forlan , left , scores a goal past germany goalkeeper joerg butt sidelined stars germany went into the game with a slew of sidelined top players .
watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2010 texan sorbs travel to germany in search of ancestral roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigersdorf church offered the visitors an insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs a group of texan visitors , descendants of the slavic minority , the sorbs , recently traveled through eastern germany in an attempt to see for themselves where their ancestors come from . bob boyce , a retired pastor from texas , recently organized a bus tour through eastern germany for his fellow americans from the southern us state .
it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2010 texan sorbs travel to germany in search of ancestral roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigersdorf church offered the visitors an insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs a group of texan visitors , descendants of the slavic minority , the sorbs , recently traveled through eastern germany in an attempt to see for themselves where their ancestors come from . bob boyce , a retired pastor from texas , recently organized a bus tour through eastern germany for his fellow americans from the southern us state .
it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.07.2010 france , germany push for financial transaction tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say the tax could help debt-laden governments despite being rejected by the g20 , france and germany are pressing for a discussion at the next meeting of eu finance ministers on plans to introduce a tax on financial transactions in europe . in a joint letter to the belgian presidency of the european union , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his french counterpart christine lagarde have called on fellow eu members to proceed with the idea of the transaction tax among themselves .
" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 10.07.2010 third-placed germany exits the world cup showing its finer qualities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's goal put germany on the road to third place germany may not be returning home with a prize which reflects the quality of their best performances in south africa but their 3-2 play-off win over uruguay showed much of what this exciting team is capable of . bill shankly , the legendary liverpool manager , once said : " first is first but second is nowhere . "
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .
bildunterschrift : forlan , left , scores a goal past germany goalkeeper joerg butt sidelined stars germany went into the game with a slew of sidelined top players .
watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .

the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

" croatia sends a positive message to all countries aspiring to join the european family , " kosor said , stressing that the government was strongly supporting croatia 's membership bid . the integration of the balkan region , which was torn apart when yugoslavia was split up in the 1990s , would " strengthen the security of european territory , " she said . " all of us here are striving to the same goal - eventual integration of southeastern european countries in the euro-atlantic political and security framework , " kosor added . eu president herman van rompuy said this week that croatia 's eu entry would send a positive signal to the region by proving that accession to the eu is attainable . croatia would be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu since slovenia in 2004 . fast-track membership talks the croation government hopes to conclude membership talks with brussels by the end of the year and become a full-fledged eu member by 2012 . french premier francois fillon told the summit he believed that the future for balkan countries lay in being a part of the eu . but he stressed that countries wishing to join the eu needed to undergo " deep transformations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said deep transformations were needed croatian president ivo josipovic said that eu membership would " determine the development of this part of the world in a permanent and key way . "
" both eu and this gathering should send a clear message that there is place in the eu for all southeastern european countries - it is a message of optimism , encouragement , " josipovic said .
bulgaria 's prime minister boyko borisov , poland 's pm donald tusk and slovenia 's pm borut pahor also attended the meeting .
other participants included albanian prime minister sali berisha , his kosovo counterpart hashim thaci , eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele and several nato officials .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , however , pulled out at the last moment .
conspicuous absence serbia was also not represented at the meeting , boycotting the summit to protest the presence of representatives from kosovo .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 , a move recognized by the united states and 22 eu member states .
spain and four other european union states were urged thursday to drop their opposition to kosovo 's independence by the european parliament .
kosovo is meant to be integrated into the european union like all other balkan states , but the process has been hindered by the refusal of spain , slovakia , romania , greece and cyprus to recognize its independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.07.2010 france , germany push for financial transaction tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say the tax could help debt-laden governments despite being rejected by the g20 , france and germany are pressing for a discussion at the next meeting of eu finance ministers on plans to introduce a tax on financial transactions in europe . in a joint letter to the belgian presidency of the european union , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his french counterpart christine lagarde have called on fellow eu members to proceed with the idea of the transaction tax among themselves .
" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

" croatia sends a positive message to all countries aspiring to join the european family , " kosor said , stressing that the government was strongly supporting croatia 's membership bid . the integration of the balkan region , which was torn apart when yugoslavia was split up in the 1990s , would " strengthen the security of european territory , " she said . " all of us here are striving to the same goal - eventual integration of southeastern european countries in the euro-atlantic political and security framework , " kosor added . eu president herman van rompuy said this week that croatia 's eu entry would send a positive signal to the region by proving that accession to the eu is attainable . croatia would be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu since slovenia in 2004 . fast-track membership talks the croation government hopes to conclude membership talks with brussels by the end of the year and become a full-fledged eu member by 2012 . french premier francois fillon told the summit he believed that the future for balkan countries lay in being a part of the eu . but he stressed that countries wishing to join the eu needed to undergo " deep transformations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said deep transformations were needed croatian president ivo josipovic said that eu membership would " determine the development of this part of the world in a permanent and key way . "
" both eu and this gathering should send a clear message that there is place in the eu for all southeastern european countries - it is a message of optimism , encouragement , " josipovic said .
bulgaria 's prime minister boyko borisov , poland 's pm donald tusk and slovenia 's pm borut pahor also attended the meeting .
other participants included albanian prime minister sali berisha , his kosovo counterpart hashim thaci , eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele and several nato officials .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , however , pulled out at the last moment .
conspicuous absence serbia was also not represented at the meeting , boycotting the summit to protest the presence of representatives from kosovo .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 , a move recognized by the united states and 22 eu member states .
spain and four other european union states were urged thursday to drop their opposition to kosovo 's independence by the european parliament .
kosovo is meant to be integrated into the european union like all other balkan states , but the process has been hindered by the refusal of spain , slovakia , romania , greece and cyprus to recognize its independence .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

dw-world.de divisions emerge in german government over transaction tax days after the german center-right coalition government presented a unified front on a new tax on the financial sector , parliamentary and cabinet leaders have made skeptical statements over its feasibility .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .

with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2010 texan sorbs travel to germany in search of ancestral roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigersdorf church offered the visitors an insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs a group of texan visitors , descendants of the slavic minority , the sorbs , recently traveled through eastern germany in an attempt to see for themselves where their ancestors come from . bob boyce , a retired pastor from texas , recently organized a bus tour through eastern germany for his fellow americans from the southern us state .
it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .
schaeuble and lagarde asked reynders to put the matter on the agenda at an informal gathering of eu finance ministers in september .
at that gathering , " germany and france will jointly make proposals for discussion in order to carry forward a european solution , " schaeuble and lagarde said .
tax could help finance global projects supporters of the tax say that the financial sector is responsible for the international economic downturn and want a levy to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis and rein in risky speculation on financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and lagarde want the matter to be discussed at a meeting in september germany has said it would introduce such a tax on its own , if the preferred global or european introduction fails .
a spokesman from the french finance ministry said the proceeds from the financial transaction tax could be used to finance global projects in the public good , such as combating climate change . former german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the tax revenue could be used to fight global poverty .
" developing countries have been especially hard hit as a result of the global financial crisis .
and they are the one who do n't have the financial means to counter the consequences of the crisis , " wieczorek-zeul said .
on saturday , the head of metal and electronics industry union gesamtmetall voiced support for the idea , saying that it would help to encourage investment away from the financial sector to manufacturing as well as raising revenue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesamtmetall president martin kannegiesser said the " real economy " would benefit " it would make the pushing backwards and forwards of money on the financial markets more expensive and create the incentive to invest more in the real economy , " martin kannegiesser told german daily newspaper berliner zeitung .
britain is at the forefront of opposition within the eu to such a tax , arguing that financial institutions would move to other parts of the world , such as asia .
sweden - which introduced a similar tax in the 1980s before scrapping it - is also opposed , warning that businesses would be forced to carry out their transactions elsewhere .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .
bildunterschrift : forlan , left , scores a goal past germany goalkeeper joerg butt sidelined stars germany went into the game with a slew of sidelined top players .
watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .
in germany 's goal , manuel neuer was replaced by joerg butt .
defender dennis aogo made his world cup debut on saturday .
in sunday ’ s final match at johannesburg 's soccer city stadium , an estimated 500 million viewers from around the world will watch spain and the netherlands battle it out for the world cup title .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

" croatia sends a positive message to all countries aspiring to join the european family , " kosor said , stressing that the government was strongly supporting croatia 's membership bid . the integration of the balkan region , which was torn apart when yugoslavia was split up in the 1990s , would " strengthen the security of european territory , " she said . " all of us here are striving to the same goal - eventual integration of southeastern european countries in the euro-atlantic political and security framework , " kosor added . eu president herman van rompuy said this week that croatia 's eu entry would send a positive signal to the region by proving that accession to the eu is attainable . croatia would be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu since slovenia in 2004 . fast-track membership talks the croation government hopes to conclude membership talks with brussels by the end of the year and become a full-fledged eu member by 2012 . french premier francois fillon told the summit he believed that the future for balkan countries lay in being a part of the eu . but he stressed that countries wishing to join the eu needed to undergo " deep transformations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said deep transformations were needed croatian president ivo josipovic said that eu membership would " determine the development of this part of the world in a permanent and key way . "
" both eu and this gathering should send a clear message that there is place in the eu for all southeastern european countries - it is a message of optimism , encouragement , " josipovic said .
bulgaria 's prime minister boyko borisov , poland 's pm donald tusk and slovenia 's pm borut pahor also attended the meeting .
other participants included albanian prime minister sali berisha , his kosovo counterpart hashim thaci , eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele and several nato officials .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , however , pulled out at the last moment .
conspicuous absence serbia was also not represented at the meeting , boycotting the summit to protest the presence of representatives from kosovo .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 , a move recognized by the united states and 22 eu member states .
spain and four other european union states were urged thursday to drop their opposition to kosovo 's independence by the european parliament .
kosovo is meant to be integrated into the european union like all other balkan states , but the process has been hindered by the refusal of spain , slovakia , romania , greece and cyprus to recognize its independence .

" we are convinced that the european union shall pursue its efforts towards the setting up of such a tax that is both feasible and necessary , " the letter says .
the latest push for the tax comes after the idea was rejected at a meeting of the g20 group of leading developed and developing in canada last month . " we strongly welcome the commitment of the belgian presidency to examine the various proposals for innovative financing in line with the international agenda and to explore , in particular , the possibility of a global financial transaction tax , " the letter said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 10.07.2010 klose , lahm to sit out germany 's third-place match against uruguay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defensive midfield star schweinsteiger will be on the pitch for the uruguay game third place is hardly the prize joachim loew and his team were hoping to take home , but saturday 's game could be a useful test of the team 's depth moving forward .
but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .
bildunterschrift : forlan , left , scores a goal past germany goalkeeper joerg butt sidelined stars germany went into the game with a slew of sidelined top players .
watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .
in germany 's goal , manuel neuer was replaced by joerg butt .
defender dennis aogo made his world cup debut on saturday .
in sunday ’ s final match at johannesburg 's soccer city stadium , an estimated 500 million viewers from around the world will watch spain and the netherlands battle it out for the world cup title .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2010 texan sorbs travel to germany in search of ancestral roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weigersdorf church offered the visitors an insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs a group of texan visitors , descendants of the slavic minority , the sorbs , recently traveled through eastern germany in an attempt to see for themselves where their ancestors come from . bob boyce , a retired pastor from texas , recently organized a bus tour through eastern germany for his fellow americans from the southern us state .
it was no ordinary journey .
the trip took the group across the lausitz region - lusatia in english - about 150 kilometers southeast of berlin .
it 's home to the sorbs , a 60,000-strong slavic minority . for the americans , many of them sorbs themselves , the tour was a way of getting in touch with their roots .
" if this is your first trip , you 're taking a look at the ancestor homeland , " bob boyce , seated in front of the bus , announced to his fellow travelers .
for many who took the tour , it was an emotional experience .
" my maternal grandparents came from here , " 88-year-old arnold mathias said as he had himself photographed in front of a sign saying " dauben , " a small village in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob boyce and his " wendish girl " georgie boyce lusatia , where the city of bautzen is located , has been the home of the sorbs - or wends as they 're also known - for about 1 , 000 years .
the minority has kept its culture alive , celebrating festivals with colorful processions in ethnic costumes .
the street signs in the region are both in german and in sorbian - a language related to polish and czech - so bautzen is budysin in sorbian .
immigration all over the world the texans ' search for their sorb origins in eastern germany is no mere coincidence .
in the 19th century , sorbs migrated to other parts of the world setting up the largest sorb colony in texas .
in 1854 , about 600 people emigrated from bautzen to america not just in search of a better life , but in order to keep their conservative lutheran faith since two churches in the then prussia were to be unionized by the king at that time .
the immigrants followed a pastor named jan killian who was the founder of the village church of weigersdorf near bautzen .
they tried to cross the ocean on a ship from liverpool , but were n't too lucky .
an outbreak of cholera forced the ship to stop over in ireland and an estimated 81 sorbs died during the journey . the survivors however built a town in texas called serbin and now it 's their great-great-great-grandchildren who have made their way back to the home of their ancestors .
nostalgia and pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the famous blue lusatia mountains " i love it partly because it feeds a nostalgic kind of spirit within me , " walter dube said .
a passionate photographer , dube said he was very impressed by the pastoral landscape of lusatia .
he dug deep into his family history and found out that his great-great-great grandfather must have died somewhere on the journey to texas , but that his great-great-great grandmother made her way to the new world together with eight children .
now dube has returned to pay tribute to them .
the group said it was overwhelmed by the warm welcome they received in the area , with the present day pastor of weigersdorf church giving them a brief insight into the history of the lutheran sorbs .
" i like it because it makes my wife very happy to be here in the land of her ancestors , " bob boyce said .
the former pastor has visited the area several times and established strong friendships with the locals .
boyce himself has no sorbian link , but says his wife georgie is " pure wendish . " like many of the american visitors , georgie boyce is very proud of her ancestral heritage and is well-versed with the details of her family history .
preserving sorbian culture however , the american visitors ' interest in their roots does n't only bring them in touch with their ancestors ' history , but also puts a spotlight on the situation of the sorbs in lusatia .
there is even a wendish museum showcasing sorb culture and customs in texas .
and in fall this year , visitors of the 22nd wendish fest in serbin , texas , will be able to find out more about sorb traditions such as quilting or sauerkraut-making , that way , the descendants of the immigrants today also help to preserve sorb culture .
" there is a wendish poem that expresses their homesickness for the blue mountains of their homeland " , vivian taylor , another texan visitor , said in the bus as the lusatia mountains passed by outside the window .
like her , other descendants of the sorbs are likely to trace their roots in this south eastern corner of germany .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .
it was certainly not the accolade they were hoping to come home with from south africa , but the manner of their victory over uruguay reminded those who had followed their progress at this tournament that this was a new germany team capable of exciting attacking football . author : nick amies editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .
emboldened by the skipper 's arm band , he was at the heart of everything .
rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .
the youngster 's eye for goal was sorely missing from the team against spain , and one has to wonder whether germany could have prevailed had he been eligible . pressure 's on in the second half perversely , it was a mistake by schweinsteiger which allowed uruguay to equalize .
the stand-in captain dithered in midfield , allowing diego perez to rob him of possession .
perez slid a slide rule pass inside the retreating defense for edinson cavani to race clear and slot the ball past reserve keeper hans joerg butt . uruguay was giving no indication that they considered third-place to be nowhere .
a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .
marcel jansen rising above muslera to head in jerome boateng 's deep cross .
moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .
in one moment , forlan had the chance to restore uruguay 's lead , in the next cacau missed an opportunity to put germany ahead .
stefan kiessling came on and nearly changed the game with his first chance .
neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .
it was only what a more disciplined germany deserved , rediscovering their rhythm and formation amid the craziness and desperation of uruguay . bildunterschrift : khedira 's winner capped a see-saw performance full of industry , excitement and a few gaffs khedira 's goal knocked the stuffing out of the south americans and germany capitalized , tearing through the light blue ranks at will .
kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .

bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .
bildunterschrift : forlan , left , scores a goal past germany goalkeeper joerg butt sidelined stars germany went into the game with a slew of sidelined top players .
watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .
in germany 's goal , manuel neuer was replaced by joerg butt .
defender dennis aogo made his world cup debut on saturday .
in sunday ’ s final match at johannesburg 's soccer city stadium , an estimated 500 million viewers from around the world will watch spain and the netherlands battle it out for the world cup title .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

but the team will have to make do without its top stars . germany and uruguay prepared to battle for third place in the world cup 's penultimate match on saturday , in a game neither team really wanted to play .
the third place playoff has always been somewhat of an anticlimax , with the world ’ s attention focused on sunday 's final match-up between spain and the netherlands .
an estimated 500 million viewers around the world are expected to watch the final , making it one of the most-watched events in history .
both germany and uruguay , though , were determined to give their all and remind the world why they got as far as they did .
" nobody needs to hang their heads low and we want to have a good final match , " german coach joachim loew said before the game .
until saturday , it remained unclear whether some of germany 's top players would take part in the last game .
germany captain philipp lahm , wing striker lukas podolski and loew spent friday morning not on the practice field , but in bed .
each had come down with the flu .
hours before kickoff , news broke that the two players would sit out the final match .
according to german mass-circulation tabloid daily bild , defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger will step in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
replacing podolski on the left will be marcell jansen .
it 's understandable that their immune systems gave out at this juncture , considering what a draining last couple of weeks they all had - and what a letdown it must have been to make it all the way to the world cup semifinal only to lose .
according to team manager oliver bierhoff , the fact that germany will field a changed side does not diminish the team 's will to win .
" we 're putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that we need to take the game seriously , " he said .
" we need to keep stretching ourselves , " added thomas mueller , who can add to his four-goal tournament tally in the game .
" we ca n't go into the game with a sloppy attitude . "
bildunterschrift : klose will miss out on the chance to break the goalscoring record held by ronaldo klose sitting out suffering from back trouble in recent days , striker miroslav klose will also sit out germany 's final game and will be replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
future plans attempts at setting records and stay-focused rhetoric aside , germany may not be as motivated to get a result on saturday as its opponents .
the germans have won three world cup titles , and more recently came third at the 2006 cup and second at the 2008 european championship .
uruguay , conversely , have been in the football wilderness .
they have n't been this far since 1970 - when , incidentally , they lost 1-0 in the third-place game - to germany .
but from a long-term perspective , the game could prove to be critical to this young germany side .
joachim loew has not yet made it clear whether he will continue as german coach - but it appears very likely .
loew 's system has produced good results in south africa , but the coach will need to explore his squad 's depth moving forward .
bildunterschrift : loew and his assistants are not yet ready to commit to coming back - but signs point to yes first , there are the aging players who are all but certain not to be available in brazil in 2014 .
at 31 and 32 respectively , arne friedrich and miroslav klose are playing in their last world cup .
loew may want to see more of cacau -lrb- 29 -rrb- , mario gomez -lrb- 24 -rrb- and stefan kiessling -lrb- 26 -rrb- in the lone striker role he has occupied .
and arne friedrich , as well as he 's played in this tournament , is not a long-term solution at center back .
serdar tasci or holger badstuber could take over at some point .
second , loew may want to see if he can address the shortcomings that kept his team from getting past spain .
germany were pressed relentlessly by the spanish defense , but in any case gave the ball away much too easily .
loew 's comments after that match showed he is more than a little jealous of his opponents ' passing and ability to protect the ball , and may want to move toward a set of spain-inspired tactics that put pure ball skills at the forefront .
to do that , he 'll need to find a place in his side for more highly skilled players like toni kroos , marko marin and dennis aogo .
according to bild , aogo is expected to start in saturday 's game , his world cup debut , and both kroos and marin are candidates to see some playing time .
in goal for germany will be joerg butt .
on the opposing side , uruguay coach oscar tabarez revealed on friday that striker diego forlan had recovered from a thigh injury he suffered in the semifinal match against the netherlands , and would assume a starting rule in saturday ’ s game .
he ’ ll be joined by strike partner luis suarez , who missed the semifinal with a suspension after being sent off for a controversial handball in uruguay ’ s quarterfinal win against ghana a week ago .
also returning are center back and captain diego lugano , back from injury , and left back jorge fucile , available after a suspension .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .
bildunterschrift : forlan , left , scores a goal past germany goalkeeper joerg butt sidelined stars germany went into the game with a slew of sidelined top players .
watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .
in germany 's goal , manuel neuer was replaced by joerg butt .
defender dennis aogo made his world cup debut on saturday .
in sunday ’ s final match at johannesburg 's soccer city stadium , an estimated 500 million viewers from around the world will watch spain and the netherlands battle it out for the world cup title .

so who is bert van marwijk and how is he suddenly a potential world cup-winning coach ? it 's easy to look at the current netherlands team and be dazzled by stars .
players like wesley sneijder , arjen robben and robin van persie immediately catch the eye .
their new team ethic and steady performances at this world cup have also caught the attention .
but only a passing glance or dismissive nod may have been offered to the silver-haired man on the sidelines , the man who has steered this dutch team to their first world cup final in 32 years .
so who is bert van marwijk , and how on earth did he suddenly get to become a potentially world cup-winning coach ?
the fact that van marwijk generates questions like these is a testament to the man 's approach to running this team .
after following in the illustrious footsteps of trainers such as rinus michels , the father of total football , supreme tacticians like louis van gaal and guus hiddink , and legendary players-turned-managers frank rijkaard and marco van basten , van marwijk was installed as netherlands coach with barely any fanfare and more than a little skepticism .
while his predecessors could boast trophy cabinets groaning with glittering titles , heavyweight reputations gained both on and off the pitch and larger-than-life personalities -lrb- and egos to match -rrb- , the unassuming van marwijk came to the job with a solitary europa league title and a dutch cup win to his name .
a former winger who played only 45 minutes of international soccer in an injury-blighted career , the former feyenoord and borussia dortmund coach was considered by many to lack the cv needed to lead het oranje .
as events since his installation have shown , however , all this has proved to be an advantage , not a hindrance .
removing ego the dutch have long had a reputation for mid-tournament meltdowns and festering personal rivalries .
dissent has been as much part of world cup training camps as kicking a ball and few tournaments have passed without some kind of civil war or other .
coaches like van gaal and hiddink would crush these with an iron fist , an approach which often led to simmering resentment , rather than outright mutiny .
rijkaard and van basten struggled to contain such uprisings , allowing feuds to boil over - and leading key players to refuse to ever play for them again .
bildunterschrift : van marwijk 's considered approach is in stark contrast to the authoritarian style of previous coaches van marwijk appears to be the first netherlands coach in decades to realize that by removing ego from the equation - his own included - the team could find harmony and balance long before it is thrust into the pressure cooker atmosphere of the world cup .
by adopting a measured approach , he has removed one of the most inflammatory catalysts any volatile dressing room can have : the megalomaniac coach himself .
reducing friction has been one of the key factors behind van marwijk 's success with this dutch team off the pitch .
two examples of his man-management skills stand out .
understanding people firstly , when faced with handling a squad featuring the potentially explosive personalities of sneijder , robben , van persie and rafael van der vaart – a group of players christened " the famous four " by the dutch media – van marwijk is said to have held a private meeting with the quartet in which he told them that they were to put the team first .
the result has been that the dutch are more together than ever before .
even the van persie-sneijder feud , which had been simmering for two years since an altercation at euro 2008 , has failed to ignite .
bildunterschrift : the dutch coach 's focus on togetherness has brought the best out of his star-studded team secondly , by billeting the dutch squad in the noisy heart of johannesburg , close to nelson mandela square , van marwijk has shrewdly removed the isolation and boredom in which the poisonous cliques of the past could plot .
the dutch are free to roam among the locals and tourists in an area full of bars and restaurants , and live and breathe the party atmosphere of the world cup around them .
by being allowed this freedom to explore and the trust to do so responsibly , the players are more relaxed and in touch with the tournament than other teams which have been closeted away behind security fences and armed guards .
the results on the pitch reflect the harmonious atmosphere off it .
holland qualified for the world cup with a 100 percent record in qualifying and once in south africa , the dutch retained that record without dropping a point in group e before beating slovakia , brazil and uruguay to reach the final .
steel behind silk efficient , calm and sensible , van marwijk has shown intelligence when deploying the talents he has at his disposal .
he has not completely dispensed with dutch flair to get results but he has shown that a more pragmatic approach can be just as devastatingly effective as the supple skill for which they have come to be known .
preferring to eschew complex systems and formations , van marwijk has the dutch playing something approaching a 4-2-3-1 formation with mark van bommel and nigel de jong are charged to defend in front of a solid back four while a quartet of more attack-minded players -lrb- robben , snaeijder , van persie , dirk kuyt -rrb- are free to roam .
bildunterschrift : the combination of solid defense and fluid attack allows holland 's creative stars to shine van marwijk , in his own words , " does not believe in systems " and allows his front four to switch flanks , as well as between midfield and attack , depending on the changing state of play .
it 's a nod to the total football fluidity of past holland sides , and acknowledges the dutch footballing mentality , in which instinct and cooperation than positional rigidity plays the greater part in success .
while the netherlands traditionally flatter to deceive at major tournaments , burning brightly but fading when it really matters , van marwijk has added the physicality the team needed to continue to compete at the business end of this world cup while his attackers appear to be growing in the confidence which comes from getting this far .
the unsung architect of this resurgent holland team is one game away from winning the ultimate prize and bringing glory where more decorated and celebrated men have failed before him .

ten minutes into a rainy first half , germany missed a chance at an early goal as arne friedrich tried to head the ball into the net off a corner kick from mesut oezil .
the ball rattled the crossbar , rebounding to give midfielder thomas mueller a second chance , though he too was thwarted . but germany took the early lead at 19 minutes as mueller sunk the ball into uruguay 's net , past goalie fernando muslera .
not 10 minutes later , uruguay answered with a goal of their own as edinson cavanni scored the equalizer for the south americans .
uruguay takes , and loses , lead uruguay striker diego forlan , who recovered from a thigh injury in time to assume a starting rule in saturday 's game , scored six minutes into the second half to take uruguay into the lead , 2-1 .
but only five minutes later , germany 's marcell jansen , replacing striker lukas podolski , scored the europeans ' second goal .
at 82 minutes , a corner from oezil could not be cleared by the uruguayan defense as sami khedira headed the ball into the uruguay end , swinging the lead back to germany and ultimately giving them the game .

watching the game from the bench were podolski and team captain philipp lahm , both taken out by a nasty flu virus after wednesday 's semifinal loss to spain .
defensive midfielder bastian schweinsteiger stepped in for lahm as captain , with jerome boateng filling in for lahm on right defense .
klose out with back trouble suffering from continued back trouble , miroslav klose also sat out germany 's final game and was replaced by cacau .
with 14 career goals in the world cup finals , the game against uruguay was his last chance to break the goalscoring record held by brazil 's ronaldo .
at 32 , klose is unlikely to be back on the national team for the 2014 world cup in brazil .
before the tournament , klose had said his goal was to score five goals , a total that would equal his hauls at his two previous world cups and put him level on the all-time list .
due to the injury , he has to settle for four .

" croatia sends a positive message to all countries aspiring to join the european family , " kosor said , stressing that the government was strongly supporting croatia 's membership bid . the integration of the balkan region , which was torn apart when yugoslavia was split up in the 1990s , would " strengthen the security of european territory , " she said . " all of us here are striving to the same goal - eventual integration of southeastern european countries in the euro-atlantic political and security framework , " kosor added . eu president herman van rompuy said this week that croatia 's eu entry would send a positive signal to the region by proving that accession to the eu is attainable . croatia would be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu since slovenia in 2004 . fast-track membership talks the croation government hopes to conclude membership talks with brussels by the end of the year and become a full-fledged eu member by 2012 . french premier francois fillon told the summit he believed that the future for balkan countries lay in being a part of the eu . but he stressed that countries wishing to join the eu needed to undergo " deep transformations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said deep transformations were needed croatian president ivo josipovic said that eu membership would " determine the development of this part of the world in a permanent and key way . "
" both eu and this gathering should send a clear message that there is place in the eu for all southeastern european countries - it is a message of optimism , encouragement , " josipovic said .
bulgaria 's prime minister boyko borisov , poland 's pm donald tusk and slovenia 's pm borut pahor also attended the meeting .
other participants included albanian prime minister sali berisha , his kosovo counterpart hashim thaci , eu enlargement commissioner stefan fuele and several nato officials .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , however , pulled out at the last moment .
conspicuous absence serbia was also not represented at the meeting , boycotting the summit to protest the presence of representatives from kosovo .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 , a move recognized by the united states and 22 eu member states .
spain and four other european union states were urged thursday to drop their opposition to kosovo 's independence by the european parliament .
kosovo is meant to be integrated into the european union like all other balkan states , but the process has been hindered by the refusal of spain , slovakia , romania , greece and cyprus to recognize its independence .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .
the world cup would not be waiting for the winner at the final whistle but national pride and the reward of victory itself would be . maybe it was the inclusion of dennis aogo , marcel jansen and cacau - players brought in to gain world cup experience and replace those stricken by illness and injuries such as lahm , lukas podolski and miroslav klose - but germany initially looked untypically fragmented in the opening exchanges with their trademark flowing attacks breaking down through sloppy control .
early nerves were also evident with aogo and cacau picking up yellow cards in the first six minutes . however germany , captained by bastian schweinsteiger in lahm 's absence , soon settled and when arne friedrich 's header hit the bar on ten minutes , the early nerves seemed to dissipate .
schweinsteiger , a shadow of himself against spain , was once more on imperious form .

rather than sitting back to protect the back four , he left sami khedira to beef up the defense , choosing instead to power between the penalty areas , spraying passes left and right to jansen and mesut oezil . bildunterschrift : forlan volleyed in his fourth goal of the tournament to put uruguay ahead - if only for three minutes it was schweinsteiger , powering into space in front of the uruguayan defense , who created germany 's first goal .
his hammered shot from distance was spilled by uruguayan keeper muslera and thomas mueller , back in the team after being suspended for the semi-final , smacked in the loose ball for his fifth goal of the tournament , putting him equal top on the list for the golden boot award for top scorer .

a victory over germany and the best placed finish in a world cup for 60 years seemed to be motivation enough for the south american over-achievers .
after they equalized , they were faster into the tackle , speedier on the counter and hungrier than germany for the remainder of the first half .
luis suarez could have put them ahead before the break had his cross-goal shot been a few centimeters more accurate . uruguay started the second half as confidently as they finished the first and germany 's defense was soon carved open within five minutes of the restart , leaving diego forlan to volley in a spectacular goal from egidio arevalo 's cross . after going behind , germany started to press and began to show the attacking shape that had put england and argentina to the sword .
within three minutes , it was 2-2 .

moments later , a fast break from cacau almost resulted in oezil putting germany ahead but the midfielder needed too many touches .
the shape and movement that had deserted germany against spain was suddenly back . however , as germany pushed forward , holes began to appear at the back and joachim loew 's team was lucky not to concede again from a suarez long-shot which swerved in the air in front of butt , forcing the keeper to awkwardly punch the ball clear . last-minute victory it was starting to look like playground soccer , with both teams charging from one end to the other , chasing frantically and spurning chances .

neither team looked willing to defend in a bid to hold out for penalties .
suddenly third place meant everything . as the clock ticked down , germany started to look the more composed .
their attacks looked better structured compared to uruguay who had begun to resort to kick-and-rush .
the pressure eventually paid off with eight minutes left .
chaos in the area after a mesut oezil corner resulted in sami khedira looping a header over a floundering muslera .

kiessling missed a glorious chance to sew up the game when he blazed over unmarked in the area with only two minutes to play . in the final seconds of added time , uruguay wasted a glorious chance to send the game into overtime but forlan 's free-kick slapped off the cross bar and germany survived . in the end , germany hung on and retained their third-place status which they won at the 2006 world cup .

"
he did n't even bother to mention where third or fourth would feature .
it is this belief which can threaten to turn the world cup third place play-off game into the anti-climax it must certainly be for the two teams who had higher hopes coming into the final weekend of the tournament . how , one wonders , can the players who came so close to making it to the final rally themselves to fight for the right to be recognized as the third best team at the fifa 2010 world cup ?
as a team , you 've effectively been knocked out only to be forced to stick around for a pointless showpiece .
what 's the point ?
if you 're not first , you ’ re nowhere … right ? after witnessing how broken the germans and uruguayans were after their semi-final defeats , it would have been no surprise to see 22 disillusioned men going through the motions for 90 minutes in port elizabeth on saturday night . anyone who saw germany captain philipp lahm 's painfully raw post-match press conference may have wondered how he or any of his young team mates could ever pull their boots on again after losing to spain , let alone continue in a competition they had such high hopes of winning , such was the devastation on lahm 's face . bildunterschrift : mueller followed up schweinsteiger 's shot to hit his fifth goal of the world cup and open the scoring honor 's the prize despite all the pain and disappointment , in front of a raucous audience which demanded a committed performance , germany and uruguay went at each other as only true professionals can .

music fans gathered in john frost square for saturday 's festival dedicated to the founder of tj 's , who died in march , aged 66 .
andy barding , one of the organisers , said they were inundated by bands .
" everyone wanted to play - the difficulty was choosing which bands would get a slot on stage , " he said .
" with the overspill we 've got some other gigs happening around the town the night after - a lot of the bands were just desperate to play in tribute to their old friend john . "
the darling buds - a newport band who enjoyed pop stardom in the late 1980s and early 1990s - reformed after 17 years for the event .
other bands playing together for the first time in years included novocaine , doctor bison , flyscreen , rollerco , varispeed and disco .
mr sicolo opened tj 's in 1971 , and it developed a reputation as a place for up-and-coming bands to make a name for themselves after it was championed by bbc dj john peel .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
oasis , green day , echo and the bunnymen , the manic street preachers and primal scream were among the bands who appeared at tj 's on their rise to stardom .
the late nirvana frontman kurt cobain is also reputed to have proposed to fellow musician and future wife courtney love at the venue in 1991 .
andrea lewis appears with a reformed darling buds after 17 years apart mr barding said the venue 's reputation was largely down to mr sicolo himself .
" he was a very magnetic character and very well known across the world , especially in america and canada , for his hospitality , " he said .
" every band that would come in on tour would get a nice meal home cooked by john and most times they 'd be staying in his spare room .
" for many bands it would probably be the best meal they 'd had in a couple of weeks and the best night 's sleep . "
the venue has now closed and the premises have been put up for sale .
an exhibition of photos from the venue and signed t-shirts was on display at the side of john frost square during the event .

faze did a 360-mile round trip to catch the promo for their track heart and soul at the bbc norfolk music video festival .
the indie-rockers ' video was shown on europe 's biggest hd digital screen at the forum in norwich .
it was one of 50 videos selected for the festival , which ran from 28 june to 10 july 2010 .
more exposure " our feature at the bbc norfolk music video festival was a really good way for us to get exposure for our work on a national level , " said lead singer maf milnes .
" we had a top day visiting norwich , and it was great to meet the team working for bbc norfolk and find out about music scene down in the area . "
the four-piece filmed their industrial-styled video for heart and soul - taken from their recently-released ep do you believe - in an old textile mill where their studio is based .
" the video was filmed in february so it was very cold , " said maf , 25 .
" we had a pre-launch party for our ep the night before so we were all feeling a bit rough on the day ! "
do you believe is the fourth ep the unsigned band have released , after getting together as teenagers at a youth centre in the city 's lidget green district .
faze filmed their video in bradford 's try mills where their studio is based support sets for the last three years , faze have been a four-piece and having gigged extensively around yorkshire , they 've started to spread their wings and want to set up gigs in norwich following their appearance in the video festival .
" we want to be more selective in our shows , " said maf , who is a youth and community worker in bradford .
" we 've played the north quite a lot and we 're now getting support slots with established artists .
" we play london quite regularly where we 've supported the levellers , alabama 3 and shed seven . "
faze 's inclusion in the bbc norfolk music video festival - which was open to bands across the country - means it strikes a chord with their mission to win new fans outside of their home patch .
video show the band 's promo was shown as part of a three-and-a-half-hour show screened twice a day on fusion 's 60-ft wide screen .
the event 's aim is to highlight the wealth of creativity emerging from unsigned and under-the-radar music acts and film-makers .
norfolk bands alto 45 , fever fever and franko fraize are just some of the local outfits who had videos chosen for the festival programme .
their song promos appeared alongside those of more established national acts including the wave pictures , blood red shoes and the twilight sad - whose video stars the grand-daughter of legendary film-maker david lynch .
