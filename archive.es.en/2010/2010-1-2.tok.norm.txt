the comment comes ahead of a key afghanistan conference in london . in an interview with germany 's focus news magazine , westerwelle said he wanted nato troops to hand over security command to afghan forces in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants a speedy transfer of security in afghanistan the minister said the handover of security should be addressed at a meeting to be held in london later in january to discuss nato 's further strategy in afghanistan .
" at the afghanistan conference in london we should work on starting the process of transferring responsibility for security in afghanistan from 2010 , " westerwelle told the magazine .
he added that the handover should begin on a regional level , saying that the process would offer an " exit strategy " for german troops .
broad political approach in afghanistan with up to 4,500 troops in the north of afghanistan , germany has the third-largest nato contingent in the country .
however , the german government has so far resisted calls to commit troops to augment us president barack obama 's plan to send an additional 30,000 soldiers .
according to recent opinion polls , up to three quarters of the german population are opposed to the bundeswehr , the german armed forces ' involvement in the afghan conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.01.2010 german car industry changes gears to suit global market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vda says there 's life after the car-scrapping scheme german car makers are bracing for a tougher year ahead after government subsidies helped them get through 2009 .
according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .
germany 's car-scrapping bonus entitled car owners to trade in cars older than nine years old for a 2,500 euro -lrb- $ 3,500 -rrb- bonus towards a newer , fuel efficient vehicle .
the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .
with three out of four cars built in germany being made for export , german auto makers are expected to follow closely developments on the international market .
" if baic buys gm 's unit saab , and another chinese company buys ford 's volvo , then that is a sign that the balance is shifting in the global auto market , " he said , referring to recent market developments .
as china overtook the united states as the world 's biggest auto market , beijing automotive industrial holding corp -lrb- baic -rrb- agreed to pay about 140 million euros for the technology of general motors ' swedish saab subsidiary , and us rival ford is nearing an agreement to sell volvo to china 's geely .
" nobody can rest on what has been achieved so far , " wissmann said. nrt / rb / reuters / afp / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .

the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .

germany 's car-scrapping bonus entitled car owners to trade in cars older than nine years old for a 2,500 euro -lrb- $ 3,500 -rrb- bonus towards a newer , fuel efficient vehicle .
the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .

" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .

some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .

over 250 seamen are now held hostage . a british-flagged ship heading for the gulf of aden was hijacked late on friday by pirates , the fourth such hijacking in less than six days . " the asian glory , " which was transporting cars from singapore to jeddah in saudi arabia , was seized about 600 miles east of the somali coast before it could join a convoy .
the ship ’ s payload can be up to 4,000 cars . commander john harbour , a spokesperson for navfor , the european union 's counter-piracy force , said that the ship was well outside navfor 's area of operation when it was overpowered . around 260 people held hostage the waters around somalia are among the most dangerous in the world . another british-flagged ship , the chemical tanker " st james park , " was seized on monday in the gulf of aden .
london-based zodiac maritime agencies manage both ships but the company says there is no other connection between the hijackings which it described as a case of lightning striking the same place twice . also on monday , the greek-owned carrier " navios apollon " was seized by pirates .
and on wednesday , pirates hijacked the " m / v pramoni , " a singapore-flagged chemical tanker , heading to india across the gulf of aden the pirates are now holding some 12 merchant ships .

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .

" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .

bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .
with three out of four cars built in germany being made for export , german auto makers are expected to follow closely developments on the international market .
" if baic buys gm 's unit saab , and another chinese company buys ford 's volvo , then that is a sign that the balance is shifting in the global auto market , " he said , referring to recent market developments .
as china overtook the united states as the world 's biggest auto market , beijing automotive industrial holding corp -lrb- baic -rrb- agreed to pay about 140 million euros for the technology of general motors ' swedish saab subsidiary , and us rival ford is nearing an agreement to sell volvo to china 's geely .
" nobody can rest on what has been achieved so far , " wissmann said. nrt / rb / reuters / afp / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the comment comes ahead of a key afghanistan conference in london . in an interview with germany 's focus news magazine , westerwelle said he wanted nato troops to hand over security command to afghan forces in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants a speedy transfer of security in afghanistan the minister said the handover of security should be addressed at a meeting to be held in london later in january to discuss nato 's further strategy in afghanistan .
" at the afghanistan conference in london we should work on starting the process of transferring responsibility for security in afghanistan from 2010 , " westerwelle told the magazine .
he added that the handover should begin on a regional level , saying that the process would offer an " exit strategy " for german troops .
broad political approach in afghanistan with up to 4,500 troops in the north of afghanistan , germany has the third-largest nato contingent in the country .
however , the german government has so far resisted calls to commit troops to augment us president barack obama 's plan to send an additional 30,000 soldiers .
according to recent opinion polls , up to three quarters of the german population are opposed to the bundeswehr , the german armed forces ' involvement in the afghan conflict .

he insists the meeting must also discuss civilian reconstruction work .
" some people think it is good foreign policy to say yes to whatever is suggested by other governments .
my request is that we form our own opinion and then develop a strategy together with our allies , " westerwelle told focus .
merkel reaffirms commitment to afghanistan in her traditional new year 's eve address chancellor merkel had stressed that afghanistan would remain a priority for her government in 2010 .
however , she also acknowledged the role of german soldiers and civilians in the reconstruction of afghanistan , admitting the need for an eventual transfer of responsibility .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said in her speech on thursday .

the comment comes ahead of a key afghanistan conference in london . in an interview with germany 's focus news magazine , westerwelle said he wanted nato troops to hand over security command to afghan forces in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants a speedy transfer of security in afghanistan the minister said the handover of security should be addressed at a meeting to be held in london later in january to discuss nato 's further strategy in afghanistan .
" at the afghanistan conference in london we should work on starting the process of transferring responsibility for security in afghanistan from 2010 , " westerwelle told the magazine .
he added that the handover should begin on a regional level , saying that the process would offer an " exit strategy " for german troops .
broad political approach in afghanistan with up to 4,500 troops in the north of afghanistan , germany has the third-largest nato contingent in the country .
however , the german government has so far resisted calls to commit troops to augment us president barack obama 's plan to send an additional 30,000 soldiers .
according to recent opinion polls , up to three quarters of the german population are opposed to the bundeswehr , the german armed forces ' involvement in the afghan conflict .
westerwelle , who heads the free democratic party – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc – has insisted that a comprehensive political approach must be at the core of nato 's strategy in afghanistan , rather than merely sending more troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support for germany 's involvement in afghanistan is floundering westerwelle has drawn criticism in the last week for threatening to boycott the london conference if it focuses exclusively on troop numbers .
he insists the meeting must also discuss civilian reconstruction work .
" some people think it is good foreign policy to say yes to whatever is suggested by other governments .
my request is that we form our own opinion and then develop a strategy together with our allies , " westerwelle told focus .
merkel reaffirms commitment to afghanistan in her traditional new year 's eve address chancellor merkel had stressed that afghanistan would remain a priority for her government in 2010 .
however , she also acknowledged the role of german soldiers and civilians in the reconstruction of afghanistan , admitting the need for an eventual transfer of responsibility .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said in her speech on thursday .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .

over 250 seamen are now held hostage . a british-flagged ship heading for the gulf of aden was hijacked late on friday by pirates , the fourth such hijacking in less than six days . " the asian glory , " which was transporting cars from singapore to jeddah in saudi arabia , was seized about 600 miles east of the somali coast before it could join a convoy .
the ship ’ s payload can be up to 4,000 cars . commander john harbour , a spokesperson for navfor , the european union 's counter-piracy force , said that the ship was well outside navfor 's area of operation when it was overpowered . around 260 people held hostage the waters around somalia are among the most dangerous in the world . another british-flagged ship , the chemical tanker " st james park , " was seized on monday in the gulf of aden .
london-based zodiac maritime agencies manage both ships but the company says there is no other connection between the hijackings which it described as a case of lightning striking the same place twice . also on monday , the greek-owned carrier " navios apollon " was seized by pirates .

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .
germany 's car-scrapping bonus entitled car owners to trade in cars older than nine years old for a 2,500 euro -lrb- $ 3,500 -rrb- bonus towards a newer , fuel efficient vehicle .
the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .
with three out of four cars built in germany being made for export , german auto makers are expected to follow closely developments on the international market .
" if baic buys gm 's unit saab , and another chinese company buys ford 's volvo , then that is a sign that the balance is shifting in the global auto market , " he said , referring to recent market developments .
as china overtook the united states as the world 's biggest auto market , beijing automotive industrial holding corp -lrb- baic -rrb- agreed to pay about 140 million euros for the technology of general motors ' swedish saab subsidiary , and us rival ford is nearing an agreement to sell volvo to china 's geely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.01.2010 german car industry changes gears to suit global market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vda says there 's life after the car-scrapping scheme german car makers are bracing for a tougher year ahead after government subsidies helped them get through 2009 .
according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .
germany 's car-scrapping bonus entitled car owners to trade in cars older than nine years old for a 2,500 euro -lrb- $ 3,500 -rrb- bonus towards a newer , fuel efficient vehicle .
the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .
with three out of four cars built in germany being made for export , german auto makers are expected to follow closely developments on the international market .
" if baic buys gm 's unit saab , and another chinese company buys ford 's volvo , then that is a sign that the balance is shifting in the global auto market , " he said , referring to recent market developments .
as china overtook the united states as the world 's biggest auto market , beijing automotive industrial holding corp -lrb- baic -rrb- agreed to pay about 140 million euros for the technology of general motors ' swedish saab subsidiary , and us rival ford is nearing an agreement to sell volvo to china 's geely .
" nobody can rest on what has been achieved so far , " wissmann said. nrt / rb / reuters / afp / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .
germany 's car-scrapping bonus entitled car owners to trade in cars older than nine years old for a 2,500 euro -lrb- $ 3,500 -rrb- bonus towards a newer , fuel efficient vehicle .
the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .
with three out of four cars built in germany being made for export , german auto makers are expected to follow closely developments on the international market .
" if baic buys gm 's unit saab , and another chinese company buys ford 's volvo , then that is a sign that the balance is shifting in the global auto market , " he said , referring to recent market developments .
as china overtook the united states as the world 's biggest auto market , beijing automotive industrial holding corp -lrb- baic -rrb- agreed to pay about 140 million euros for the technology of general motors ' swedish saab subsidiary , and us rival ford is nearing an agreement to sell volvo to china 's geely .

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .
germany 's car-scrapping bonus entitled car owners to trade in cars older than nine years old for a 2,500 euro -lrb- $ 3,500 -rrb- bonus towards a newer , fuel efficient vehicle .
the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .
with three out of four cars built in germany being made for export , german auto makers are expected to follow closely developments on the international market .
" if baic buys gm 's unit saab , and another chinese company buys ford 's volvo , then that is a sign that the balance is shifting in the global auto market , " he said , referring to recent market developments .
as china overtook the united states as the world 's biggest auto market , beijing automotive industrial holding corp -lrb- baic -rrb- agreed to pay about 140 million euros for the technology of general motors ' swedish saab subsidiary , and us rival ford is nearing an agreement to sell volvo to china 's geely .

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .
germany 's car-scrapping bonus entitled car owners to trade in cars older than nine years old for a 2,500 euro -lrb- $ 3,500 -rrb- bonus towards a newer , fuel efficient vehicle .
the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .
with three out of four cars built in germany being made for export , german auto makers are expected to follow closely developments on the international market .
" if baic buys gm 's unit saab , and another chinese company buys ford 's volvo , then that is a sign that the balance is shifting in the global auto market , " he said , referring to recent market developments .
as china overtook the united states as the world 's biggest auto market , beijing automotive industrial holding corp -lrb- baic -rrb- agreed to pay about 140 million euros for the technology of general motors ' swedish saab subsidiary , and us rival ford is nearing an agreement to sell volvo to china 's geely .
" nobody can rest on what has been achieved so far , " wissmann said. nrt / rb / reuters / afp / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants a speedy transfer of security in afghanistan the minister said the handover of security should be addressed at a meeting to be held in london later in january to discuss nato 's further strategy in afghanistan .
" at the afghanistan conference in london we should work on starting the process of transferring responsibility for security in afghanistan from 2010 , " westerwelle told the magazine .
he added that the handover should begin on a regional level , saying that the process would offer an " exit strategy " for german troops .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .
with three out of four cars built in germany being made for export , german auto makers are expected to follow closely developments on the international market .
" if baic buys gm 's unit saab , and another chinese company buys ford 's volvo , then that is a sign that the balance is shifting in the global auto market , " he said , referring to recent market developments .
as china overtook the united states as the world 's biggest auto market , beijing automotive industrial holding corp -lrb- baic -rrb- agreed to pay about 140 million euros for the technology of general motors ' swedish saab subsidiary , and us rival ford is nearing an agreement to sell volvo to china 's geely .

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .
germany 's car-scrapping bonus entitled car owners to trade in cars older than nine years old for a 2,500 euro -lrb- $ 3,500 -rrb- bonus towards a newer , fuel efficient vehicle .
the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .

over 250 seamen are now held hostage . a british-flagged ship heading for the gulf of aden was hijacked late on friday by pirates , the fourth such hijacking in less than six days . " the asian glory , " which was transporting cars from singapore to jeddah in saudi arabia , was seized about 600 miles east of the somali coast before it could join a convoy .
the ship ’ s payload can be up to 4,000 cars . commander john harbour , a spokesperson for navfor , the european union 's counter-piracy force , said that the ship was well outside navfor 's area of operation when it was overpowered . around 260 people held hostage the waters around somalia are among the most dangerous in the world . another british-flagged ship , the chemical tanker " st james park , " was seized on monday in the gulf of aden .
london-based zodiac maritime agencies manage both ships but the company says there is no other connection between the hijackings which it described as a case of lightning striking the same place twice . also on monday , the greek-owned carrier " navios apollon " was seized by pirates .
and on wednesday , pirates hijacked the " m / v pramoni , " a singapore-flagged chemical tanker , heading to india across the gulf of aden the pirates are now holding some 12 merchant ships .

the comment comes ahead of a key afghanistan conference in london . in an interview with germany 's focus news magazine , westerwelle said he wanted nato troops to hand over security command to afghan forces in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants a speedy transfer of security in afghanistan the minister said the handover of security should be addressed at a meeting to be held in london later in january to discuss nato 's further strategy in afghanistan .
" at the afghanistan conference in london we should work on starting the process of transferring responsibility for security in afghanistan from 2010 , " westerwelle told the magazine .
he added that the handover should begin on a regional level , saying that the process would offer an " exit strategy " for german troops .

however , the german government has so far resisted calls to commit troops to augment us president barack obama 's plan to send an additional 30,000 soldiers .
according to recent opinion polls , up to three quarters of the german population are opposed to the bundeswehr , the german armed forces ' involvement in the afghan conflict .

the comment comes ahead of a key afghanistan conference in london . in an interview with germany 's focus news magazine , westerwelle said he wanted nato troops to hand over security command to afghan forces in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants a speedy transfer of security in afghanistan the minister said the handover of security should be addressed at a meeting to be held in london later in january to discuss nato 's further strategy in afghanistan .
" at the afghanistan conference in london we should work on starting the process of transferring responsibility for security in afghanistan from 2010 , " westerwelle told the magazine .
he added that the handover should begin on a regional level , saying that the process would offer an " exit strategy " for german troops .
broad political approach in afghanistan with up to 4,500 troops in the north of afghanistan , germany has the third-largest nato contingent in the country .
however , the german government has so far resisted calls to commit troops to augment us president barack obama 's plan to send an additional 30,000 soldiers .
according to recent opinion polls , up to three quarters of the german population are opposed to the bundeswehr , the german armed forces ' involvement in the afghan conflict .
westerwelle , who heads the free democratic party – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc – has insisted that a comprehensive political approach must be at the core of nato 's strategy in afghanistan , rather than merely sending more troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support for germany 's involvement in afghanistan is floundering westerwelle has drawn criticism in the last week for threatening to boycott the london conference if it focuses exclusively on troop numbers .
he insists the meeting must also discuss civilian reconstruction work .
" some people think it is good foreign policy to say yes to whatever is suggested by other governments .
my request is that we form our own opinion and then develop a strategy together with our allies , " westerwelle told focus .
merkel reaffirms commitment to afghanistan in her traditional new year 's eve address chancellor merkel had stressed that afghanistan would remain a priority for her government in 2010 .
however , she also acknowledged the role of german soldiers and civilians in the reconstruction of afghanistan , admitting the need for an eventual transfer of responsibility .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said in her speech on thursday .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .

over 250 seamen are now held hostage . a british-flagged ship heading for the gulf of aden was hijacked late on friday by pirates , the fourth such hijacking in less than six days . " the asian glory , " which was transporting cars from singapore to jeddah in saudi arabia , was seized about 600 miles east of the somali coast before it could join a convoy .
the ship ’ s payload can be up to 4,000 cars . commander john harbour , a spokesperson for navfor , the european union 's counter-piracy force , said that the ship was well outside navfor 's area of operation when it was overpowered . around 260 people held hostage the waters around somalia are among the most dangerous in the world . another british-flagged ship , the chemical tanker " st james park , " was seized on monday in the gulf of aden .
london-based zodiac maritime agencies manage both ships but the company says there is no other connection between the hijackings which it described as a case of lightning striking the same place twice . also on monday , the greek-owned carrier " navios apollon " was seized by pirates .
and on wednesday , pirates hijacked the " m / v pramoni , " a singapore-flagged chemical tanker , heading to india across the gulf of aden the pirates are now holding some 12 merchant ships .

the comment comes ahead of a key afghanistan conference in london . in an interview with germany 's focus news magazine , westerwelle said he wanted nato troops to hand over security command to afghan forces in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants a speedy transfer of security in afghanistan the minister said the handover of security should be addressed at a meeting to be held in london later in january to discuss nato 's further strategy in afghanistan .
" at the afghanistan conference in london we should work on starting the process of transferring responsibility for security in afghanistan from 2010 , " westerwelle told the magazine .
he added that the handover should begin on a regional level , saying that the process would offer an " exit strategy " for german troops .
broad political approach in afghanistan with up to 4,500 troops in the north of afghanistan , germany has the third-largest nato contingent in the country .
however , the german government has so far resisted calls to commit troops to augment us president barack obama 's plan to send an additional 30,000 soldiers .
according to recent opinion polls , up to three quarters of the german population are opposed to the bundeswehr , the german armed forces ' involvement in the afghan conflict .
westerwelle , who heads the free democratic party – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc – has insisted that a comprehensive political approach must be at the core of nato 's strategy in afghanistan , rather than merely sending more troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support for germany 's involvement in afghanistan is floundering westerwelle has drawn criticism in the last week for threatening to boycott the london conference if it focuses exclusively on troop numbers .
he insists the meeting must also discuss civilian reconstruction work .
" some people think it is good foreign policy to say yes to whatever is suggested by other governments .
my request is that we form our own opinion and then develop a strategy together with our allies , " westerwelle told focus .
merkel reaffirms commitment to afghanistan in her traditional new year 's eve address chancellor merkel had stressed that afghanistan would remain a priority for her government in 2010 .
however , she also acknowledged the role of german soldiers and civilians in the reconstruction of afghanistan , admitting the need for an eventual transfer of responsibility .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said in her speech on thursday .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .
germany 's car-scrapping bonus entitled car owners to trade in cars older than nine years old for a 2,500 euro -lrb- $ 3,500 -rrb- bonus towards a newer , fuel efficient vehicle .
the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .
with three out of four cars built in germany being made for export , german auto makers are expected to follow closely developments on the international market .
" if baic buys gm 's unit saab , and another chinese company buys ford 's volvo , then that is a sign that the balance is shifting in the global auto market , " he said , referring to recent market developments .
as china overtook the united states as the world 's biggest auto market , beijing automotive industrial holding corp -lrb- baic -rrb- agreed to pay about 140 million euros for the technology of general motors ' swedish saab subsidiary , and us rival ford is nearing an agreement to sell volvo to china 's geely .
" nobody can rest on what has been achieved so far , " wissmann said. nrt / rb / reuters / afp / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over 250 seamen are now held hostage . a british-flagged ship heading for the gulf of aden was hijacked late on friday by pirates , the fourth such hijacking in less than six days . " the asian glory , " which was transporting cars from singapore to jeddah in saudi arabia , was seized about 600 miles east of the somali coast before it could join a convoy .
the ship ’ s payload can be up to 4,000 cars . commander john harbour , a spokesperson for navfor , the european union 's counter-piracy force , said that the ship was well outside navfor 's area of operation when it was overpowered . around 260 people held hostage the waters around somalia are among the most dangerous in the world . another british-flagged ship , the chemical tanker " st james park , " was seized on monday in the gulf of aden .
london-based zodiac maritime agencies manage both ships but the company says there is no other connection between the hijackings which it described as a case of lightning striking the same place twice . also on monday , the greek-owned carrier " navios apollon " was seized by pirates .
and on wednesday , pirates hijacked the " m / v pramoni , " a singapore-flagged chemical tanker , heading to india across the gulf of aden the pirates are now holding some 12 merchant ships .

the comment comes ahead of a key afghanistan conference in london . in an interview with germany 's focus news magazine , westerwelle said he wanted nato troops to hand over security command to afghan forces in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants a speedy transfer of security in afghanistan the minister said the handover of security should be addressed at a meeting to be held in london later in january to discuss nato 's further strategy in afghanistan .
" at the afghanistan conference in london we should work on starting the process of transferring responsibility for security in afghanistan from 2010 , " westerwelle told the magazine .
he added that the handover should begin on a regional level , saying that the process would offer an " exit strategy " for german troops .
broad political approach in afghanistan with up to 4,500 troops in the north of afghanistan , germany has the third-largest nato contingent in the country .
however , the german government has so far resisted calls to commit troops to augment us president barack obama 's plan to send an additional 30,000 soldiers .
according to recent opinion polls , up to three quarters of the german population are opposed to the bundeswehr , the german armed forces ' involvement in the afghan conflict .
westerwelle , who heads the free democratic party – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc – has insisted that a comprehensive political approach must be at the core of nato 's strategy in afghanistan , rather than merely sending more troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support for germany 's involvement in afghanistan is floundering westerwelle has drawn criticism in the last week for threatening to boycott the london conference if it focuses exclusively on troop numbers .
he insists the meeting must also discuss civilian reconstruction work .
" some people think it is good foreign policy to say yes to whatever is suggested by other governments .
my request is that we form our own opinion and then develop a strategy together with our allies , " westerwelle told focus .
merkel reaffirms commitment to afghanistan in her traditional new year 's eve address chancellor merkel had stressed that afghanistan would remain a priority for her government in 2010 .
however , she also acknowledged the role of german soldiers and civilians in the reconstruction of afghanistan , admitting the need for an eventual transfer of responsibility .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said in her speech on thursday .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .

however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .

the comment comes ahead of a key afghanistan conference in london . in an interview with germany 's focus news magazine , westerwelle said he wanted nato troops to hand over security command to afghan forces in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants a speedy transfer of security in afghanistan the minister said the handover of security should be addressed at a meeting to be held in london later in january to discuss nato 's further strategy in afghanistan .
" at the afghanistan conference in london we should work on starting the process of transferring responsibility for security in afghanistan from 2010 , " westerwelle told the magazine .
he added that the handover should begin on a regional level , saying that the process would offer an " exit strategy " for german troops .
broad political approach in afghanistan with up to 4,500 troops in the north of afghanistan , germany has the third-largest nato contingent in the country .
however , the german government has so far resisted calls to commit troops to augment us president barack obama 's plan to send an additional 30,000 soldiers .
according to recent opinion polls , up to three quarters of the german population are opposed to the bundeswehr , the german armed forces ' involvement in the afghan conflict .
westerwelle , who heads the free democratic party – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc – has insisted that a comprehensive political approach must be at the core of nato 's strategy in afghanistan , rather than merely sending more troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support for germany 's involvement in afghanistan is floundering westerwelle has drawn criticism in the last week for threatening to boycott the london conference if it focuses exclusively on troop numbers .
he insists the meeting must also discuss civilian reconstruction work .
" some people think it is good foreign policy to say yes to whatever is suggested by other governments .
my request is that we form our own opinion and then develop a strategy together with our allies , " westerwelle told focus .
merkel reaffirms commitment to afghanistan in her traditional new year 's eve address chancellor merkel had stressed that afghanistan would remain a priority for her government in 2010 .
however , she also acknowledged the role of german soldiers and civilians in the reconstruction of afghanistan , admitting the need for an eventual transfer of responsibility .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said in her speech on thursday .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe . europe ’ s auto makers are heading for a major decline in sales 2010 , according to a new study published on friday , january 1 , which forecast that nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in western europe this year compared to 2009 .
" the auto world is re-adjusting itself and that will result in major changes for production sites " , said a study published by automobile industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer of the university of duisburg-essen .
despite the financial crisis , 2009 was the sixth best year for sales worldwide , thanks to car scrapping schemes and government-sponsored economic rescue packages .
according to the study , 52.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , 5.4 percent fewer than the previous year .
germany bucked the trend with 3.8 million cars being sold , a 24-percent increase on the same period a year ago .
in western europe , the number of sales also rose significantly .
in other countries , it was a different story : sales in north america fell by 22 percent to 12.5 million cars .
the russian car industry was hit by slumping sales of around 44 percent .
similar figures were registered by japan , canada , spain and the united kingdom .
market changes ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 8 million cars sold , china is now the world 's biggest auto market dudenhoeffer estimates that 2010 will see a fundamental shift in markets .
the worldwide market will develop positively .
global demand is expected to rise 4.3 percent to 55 million vehicles – mainly thanks to gains in the markets in the usa , china , russia and india .
in western europe , however , nearly a million fewer cars will be sold in 2010 , a drop of seven percent .
" in particular , the strong artificial push from the ' cash for clunkers ' program in germany is responsible " , said dudenhoeffer .
" germany will now pull western europe down " .

the program , which cost roughly five billion euros , not only proved a welcome shock absorber but in fact provided a boost to the industry which had taken a battering from the global economic meltdown .
some 3.8 million cars were sold in 2009 , posting a 25 percent growth in sales , according to figures released by the vda automotive industry federation .
however , the car trade-in scheme not only benefited german carmakers but importers of motor vehicles as well .
they were able to increase their market share in germany from one third to over 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : german carmakers are hoping to dominate the global market small is big according to the head of germany ’ s vda automotive industry association , matthias wissmann , german automakers will hold and further expand their position globally even as competition in the global auto industry intensifies .
" at the same time we are attacking in the small car segment , with cars that only use about 3 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- , " wissmann told french daily les echos in an interview published on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small , energy-efficient cars will be in high demand wissmann said that he expected the german auto market to normalize in 2010 , with up to 3 million new registrations – only slightly lower than the multi-year domestic average .

the asian glory was taken 620 miles -lrb- 1,000km -rrb- off the horn of africa nation 's coast , the bulgarian foreign ministry said .
the vessel , which has a multi-national crew , is the second uk-flagged ship hijacked in days , after chemical tanker the st james park was seized on monday .
the waters around somalia are among the most dangerous in the world .
as well as eight bulgarians , the other nationalities making up the asian glory 's crew are said to include ukrainians , romanians and indians .
british officials said there were no uk nationals on board the vessel .
the exact time and location of the hijacking are not yet clear .
the 13,000-tonne ship was reportedly transporting cars from singapore to jeddah in saudi arabia .
it is estimated the ship could take up to three days to reach the somali coast , from where pirates usually hold ransom talks .
the st james park , which has 26 crew from nine different countries , is currently anchored off the somali coast , where negotiations for its release are expected to start .
correspondents say the upsurge in piracy in the region is a consequence of the failure to find a solution to somalia 's continuing political disarray .
