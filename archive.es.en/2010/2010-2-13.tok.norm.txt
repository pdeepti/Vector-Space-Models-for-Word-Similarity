the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

the bundesrat also approved a bill to improve pensions of stasi victims in the former east germany . members of the bundesrat wants tough jail sentences for individuals found guilty of female genital mutilation .
the upper house has decided that the practice should constitute a specific legal crime under german law .
under current legislation , genital mutilation is merely classed as aggravated assault with a maximum prison sentence of six months .
the bundesrat now wants to raise that to a minimum of two years .
thousands of women in germany , most of them immigrants , have suffered genital mutilation , which is still an active ritual in some parts of africa and , to a lesser extent , asia and latin america . high numbers of victims meant that germany had to take action said the justice minister for the state of hesse , joerg-uwe hahn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scales of justice would weigh up mutilation as a new crime " the victims suffer all their lives from the physical and psychological effects of female genital mutilation , " hahn said . the women 's rights organization terres des femmes says some 20,000 cases of genital mutilation are known in europe , with between 4,000 and 5,000 of these in germany . prosecution for actions abroad if written into law , the rules would also allow german prosecutors to punish genital mutilation abroad where the victim is a resident in germany .
" the respect for foreign culture can not mean that we here in germany will allow physical and emotional injury to go unpunished , " hein said .
the bundesrat has also repeated its commitment to make the arranging of forced marriages a criminal offense .
the bundestag has failed to make a decision on the issue in the past .
pensions for stasi victims the bundesrat , which represents germany 's state governments at federal level , also approved a bill that would improve pensions for stasi victims with children .
under the plans , child benefits would no longer have to be declared as income .
victims of the former east german regime and its secret police , the stasi , who spent 6 months or more in prison as political prisoners , receive a so-called ' victim 's pension ' .
this is means-tested and only applies to those on low incomes .
the new bill would allow those with children , who are just above the maximum earnings threshold , to qualify for the pension as well as the child benefits .
this latest amendment is designed to compensate those who suffered at the hands of the former east german political system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims ' pension is meant to recognise the level of political persecution in the former east germany meanwhile , those who have been convicted of serious crimes will not qualify for the ' victim 's pension ' at all .
before it is passed , the bill now has to be approved by germany 's lower house in parliament , the bundestag .
record debt also on friday , the bundesrat approved the government 's budget for 2010 .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble 's proposals allow for a record deficit of 85.8 billion euros .
the federal states that make up the bundesrat agreed that the global economic crisis that led to a 5 percent drop in gross domestic product in germany last year , makes taking on more debt inevitable .
but the state premiers have warned the government that their regional budgets can not be subjected to anymore cuts .
at the same time , they have asked the government to save 10 billion euros per year by 2016 - without the help of the regional governments. rc / ng / dpa / epd / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the track , however , is to be changed . the walls will be raised at turn 16 of the course , where 21 year-old georgian nodar kumaritashvili lost control and bounced over the rim of the track straight into a metal pole . " this was done as a preventative measure , " the international luge federation -lrb- fil -rrb- said in a statement late on friday , february 12 , " in order to avoid that such an extremely exceptional accident could occur again . " the fil will resume men 's training on saturday , with two full training runs before medal competition takes place on sunday . " this is a very sad day , " the head of the international olympic committee , jacques rogge , said at the opening ceremony .
" the ioc is in deep mourning .
here you have a young athlete who lost his life pursuing his passion .
he had a dream to compete in the olympic games , he trained hard and he had this fatal accident .
i have no words to say what we feel .

" our thoughts , and those of the entire luge community , are with those most closely touched by this tragedy . " there was a sombre opening ceremony for kumaritashvili 's georgian teammates , who walked out at the bce stadium wearing black scarves . an investigation into the circumstances was launched , and experts concluded that the accident had not been caused by track deficiencies .
however , they did recommend altering the layout at the exit of turn 16 to improve safety . the investigation said that nodar kumaritashvili was on a poor line on the exit of turn 15 , despite his efforts to compensate , he was n't able to get a good entrance into turn 16 , causing him to career off the track . the whistler sliding center 's luge descent is widely considered one of the most demanding in the world .

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .
roettgen , however , also said that safety issues could lead to changes in the dates of disassembly . the three dissenters - markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden wuerttemberg , and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse - advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
all of them represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal . a hasty withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public largely oppose nuclear power while the opposition in germany - especially the green party and the social democrats - are calling for a near immediate shut down of nuclear power plants , chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and her liberal fdp coalition ally have argued that nuclear power should be used to bridge the gap until renewable power is more widely used , and cost-efficient . but nuclear power remains very unpopular amongst the german population , and the environment minister suggested this was part of his motivation to move away from atomic energy as quickly as possible . " this whole debate shows , that even after 40 years , nuclear power still has n't gained public acceptance in germany , " roettgen told the newspaper , adding that this was a good reason to try to quickly replace it . " i think the christian democratic union … should think carefully about whether we want to make nuclear power one of our unique selling points , " roettgen said .
" it would be better for people to associate us with the economic and ecological modernization of this country . " " we should not bind our public approval too closely with the continued , uninterrupted usage of nuclear power plants , " he said . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 13.02.2010 berliners brave the elements to experience cinema history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the first time in decades the film was shown in full film fans braved snow for an outdoor screening of fritz lang 's legendary movie ' metropolis ' in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .

frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .

in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .

a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .
roettgen , however , also said that safety issues could lead to changes in the dates of disassembly . the three dissenters - markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden wuerttemberg , and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse - advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
all of them represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal . a hasty withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public largely oppose nuclear power while the opposition in germany - especially the green party and the social democrats - are calling for a near immediate shut down of nuclear power plants , chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and her liberal fdp coalition ally have argued that nuclear power should be used to bridge the gap until renewable power is more widely used , and cost-efficient . but nuclear power remains very unpopular amongst the german population , and the environment minister suggested this was part of his motivation to move away from atomic energy as quickly as possible . " this whole debate shows , that even after 40 years , nuclear power still has n't gained public acceptance in germany , " roettgen told the newspaper , adding that this was a good reason to try to quickly replace it . " i think the christian democratic union … should think carefully about whether we want to make nuclear power one of our unique selling points , " roettgen said .
" it would be better for people to associate us with the economic and ecological modernization of this country . " " we should not bind our public approval too closely with the continued , uninterrupted usage of nuclear power plants , " he said . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .
roettgen , however , also said that safety issues could lead to changes in the dates of disassembly . the three dissenters - markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden wuerttemberg , and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse - advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
all of them represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal . a hasty withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public largely oppose nuclear power while the opposition in germany - especially the green party and the social democrats - are calling for a near immediate shut down of nuclear power plants , chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and her liberal fdp coalition ally have argued that nuclear power should be used to bridge the gap until renewable power is more widely used , and cost-efficient . but nuclear power remains very unpopular amongst the german population , and the environment minister suggested this was part of his motivation to move away from atomic energy as quickly as possible . " this whole debate shows , that even after 40 years , nuclear power still has n't gained public acceptance in germany , " roettgen told the newspaper , adding that this was a good reason to try to quickly replace it . " i think the christian democratic union … should think carefully about whether we want to make nuclear power one of our unique selling points , " roettgen said .
" it would be better for people to associate us with the economic and ecological modernization of this country . " " we should not bind our public approval too closely with the continued , uninterrupted usage of nuclear power plants , " he said . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .
roettgen , however , also said that safety issues could lead to changes in the dates of disassembly . the three dissenters - markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden wuerttemberg , and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse - advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .

a 3-1 victory by bayern munich against borussia dortmund later in the day took the club ’ s goal difference to 29 , one short of leverkusen 's 30 ; both clubs are tied at 48 points .
" borussia played very well tactically , but we deserved to win , but we had to work hard , " said louis van gaal , bayern 's coach .
" our goalkeeper played well to deny them .
we scored the goals , so we deserved to win . " bayern 's france international midfielder franck ribery started the match , having struggled with an injury for the past four months , though van gaal took him off during the game as he felt the frenchman was not yet up to a full game .
" we are playing three games in a week and i took ribery off to give him some breathing space ahead of our champions league match midweek .
but he is edging closer to playing a full 90-minute match . "

others gathered to form a symbolic human chain against the neo-nazis . left-wing protesters thwarted neo-nazis in their efforts to stage a " mourning march " for victims on the 65th anniversary of allied incendiary bombing raids on the city of dresden . at least 5,000 right-wing extremists wearing black gathered at the city ’ s neustadt station , hoping to stage a procession through city streets . opponents of the rally gathered in streets around the station to prevent neo-nazis from reaching their rallying point . police urged the neo-nazis to cancel the march , saying they could not guarantee the safety of participants along the route .
the procession was eventually called off late in the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden was devastated by the bombing raids in 1945 an anti-fascist group , dresden without nazis , which included politicians and trades unionists , had earlier called on city residents to block the rally in a peaceful way . " we have for the first time succeeded in preventing the biggest neo-nazi march in europe , " said alliance spokeswoman lena roth . water cannons used by police police said there had been isolated clashes between the two sides and at one point water cannons had been used .
witnesses said that bottles and fireworks were thrown by both sides at each other , as well as at the police . police spokesman thomas geithner said up to 6,000 far-right supporters from around europe had gathered to take part in what organizers called a " mourning march . " officers were brought in from all over germany to prevent the clashes and made as many as 30 arrests on both sides . accusations of exploitation the bombing raid on dresden began on the night of february 13 , 1945 , killing some 25,000 people and destroying much of the historic city .
opponents of the march claim that neo-nazis are exploiting the wartime deaths for their own ends . on the other side of the elbe river , a " human chain " of 10,000 people formed in a symbolic action called for by mayor helma orosz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial service to mark the anniversary was organized at dresden 's frauenkirche " let 's turn dresden into a peaceful and open city , a bastion against intolerance and stupidity .
we will confront nazis young and old who are trying to exploit this day of mourning , " orosz said . critics of the world war ii bombing raid claim it was unnecessary because germany was already close to defeat .

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .

" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .
roettgen , however , also said that safety issues could lead to changes in the dates of disassembly . the three dissenters - markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden wuerttemberg , and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse - advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
all of them represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal . a hasty withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public largely oppose nuclear power while the opposition in germany - especially the green party and the social democrats - are calling for a near immediate shut down of nuclear power plants , chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and her liberal fdp coalition ally have argued that nuclear power should be used to bridge the gap until renewable power is more widely used , and cost-efficient . but nuclear power remains very unpopular amongst the german population , and the environment minister suggested this was part of his motivation to move away from atomic energy as quickly as possible . " this whole debate shows , that even after 40 years , nuclear power still has n't gained public acceptance in germany , " roettgen told the newspaper , adding that this was a good reason to try to quickly replace it . " i think the christian democratic union … should think carefully about whether we want to make nuclear power one of our unique selling points , " roettgen said .
" it would be better for people to associate us with the economic and ecological modernization of this country . " " we should not bind our public approval too closely with the continued , uninterrupted usage of nuclear power plants , " he said . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the track , however , is to be changed . the walls will be raised at turn 16 of the course , where 21 year-old georgian nodar kumaritashvili lost control and bounced over the rim of the track straight into a metal pole . " this was done as a preventative measure , " the international luge federation -lrb- fil -rrb- said in a statement late on friday , february 12 , " in order to avoid that such an extremely exceptional accident could occur again . " the fil will resume men 's training on saturday , with two full training runs before medal competition takes place on sunday . " this is a very sad day , " the head of the international olympic committee , jacques rogge , said at the opening ceremony .
" the ioc is in deep mourning .
here you have a young athlete who lost his life pursuing his passion .
he had a dream to compete in the olympic games , he trained hard and he had this fatal accident .
i have no words to say what we feel . " the luge has always been considered one of the most dangerous disciplines in the winter games , as competitors hurl themselves feet-first on a small sled down icy descents at speeds as high as 145 kilometers -lrb- 90 miles -rrb- per hour . bildunterschrift : georgian athletes paid homage to their teammate teammates ' mark of respect " this is the most serious thing that can happen in sport , " the german president of the fil , josef fendt , said .
" our thoughts , and those of the entire luge community , are with those most closely touched by this tragedy . " there was a sombre opening ceremony for kumaritashvili 's georgian teammates , who walked out at the bce stadium wearing black scarves . an investigation into the circumstances was launched , and experts concluded that the accident had not been caused by track deficiencies .
however , they did recommend altering the layout at the exit of turn 16 to improve safety . the investigation said that nodar kumaritashvili was on a poor line on the exit of turn 15 , despite his efforts to compensate , he was n't able to get a good entrance into turn 16 , causing him to career off the track . the whistler sliding center 's luge descent is widely considered one of the most demanding in the world .

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.02.2010 german mom-and-pop stores make comeback with modern twist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tante emma shops were the mainstay of most small villages many small german towns used to have a local convenience store where residents met to shop and gossip .
most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

dw-world.de eastern germany catching up to west " faster than thought " a recent study suggests that the economies of germany ’ s eastern states , once under the gdr 's communist regime , may be catching up to those of their western counterparts faster than previously thought .

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

dw spoke with h.e. dr. john paul grech , the ambassador of malta to germany , on the issue , the role of the eu and the european asylum support office . his excellency dr. john paul grech has been the ambassador of malta to germany since october 2005 .
prior to that , he occupied various positions in the ministry of foreign affairs , including that of a special envoy of the government of malta to the eu .
dw : how has malta coped with illegal immigration from africa ?
john paul grech : malta has throughout the years received immigrants in a way that reflects its international obligations .
it has done its best in order to adhere to its international obligations .
given its limited resources , malta refers this problem to the european union and has been very active to put the question of illegal immigration on the agenda of the european union .
we have succeeded in that , and part of that work has been also the establishment of the pact for immigration and asylum within the european union .
how can the eu help malta tackle illegal immigration from africa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his excellency , dr. john paul grech , ambassador of malta to germany malta has been working towards establishing the principle of burden-sharing .
malta considers this to be a phenomenon , which is of interest to europe .
therefore , it has approached the issue from a two-pronged viewpoint .
on the one hand , it is very much in favor of adhering to our international obligations and promoting legal migration ; and on the other hand , it is very much aware that the european union has to embrace its responsibilities in assisting malta in the context of burden-sharing .
the eu has chosen malta to host the european asylum support office -lrb- easo -rrb- .
what is the reaction in malta ?
we are extremely pleased that malta has been chosen to host the easo , which is an office meant to address the problem of illegal immigration , tackle the administrative side of it , and also work within the european union in order to address this issue in a more constructive manner .
it is a point of satisfaction that malta has been chosen because it reflects that the european union sees malta as being at the heart of the problem .
it is receiving an enormous amount of immigrants , and therefore its experience and hands-on knowledge of what this is all about probably has been the reason why the european union chose malta to host the easo .
since 2004 , amnesty international has repeatedly condemned immigrant detention centers for being " overcrowded and characterized by poor hygiene and inadequate healthcare . "
what is being done to improve the conditions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are often held in detention centers with questionable standards well , malta has been very transparent .
we have had several international authorities coming over to visit us to see the context of the problem as it is affecting malta .
we have always maintained that help was needed given our limitations .
in the context of international cooperation and assistance from the european union , we have been doing our very best to improve conditions .
we can safely say that we can address this issue even better if our pleas to the international community , in particular the european union , are heard and the assistance is forthcoming .
what is being done to ensure that migrants who obtain the right to remain in malta are successfully integrated into the society ?
well , all efforts .
first of all , one has to see that malta has a history of hospitality .
it even folds within the ambit of its characteristics as a country with roman catholic values .
we do our best to see that those that are waiting for their own processes to be finalized are extended all the amenities required in the context or possibility .
malta does its very best in order to safeguard and guarantee that these processes are done in the most expeditious way possible .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter olympic team is confident about its strength a glittering opening ceremony at the bc place stadium featured native american music and dance , followed by a procession of participating nations .
the proceedings were touched by sadness at the death of georgian luge competitor nodar kumaritashvili , who died in a training accident on friday .
a minute of silence was observed in his honor as the olympic and canadian flag was lowered to half staff .
canadian ice hockey legend wayne gretzky and three further greats jointly lit the olympic cauldron at the opening ceremony .
gretzky was accompanied by alpine skier nancy greene , speed skater katrina lemay doan and basketball all-star steve nash in the lighting which was delayed by a technical hitch as one of the arms of the cauldron construction at bc place did not rise from the floor .
stellar record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biathlon champion kati wilhelm is going for more gold at the 2006 winter olympics in turin , germany finished top of the table with 29 medals , ahead of the united states with 25 and canada with 24 .
germany looks to be the frontrunner in the women 's biathlon with the consistently dominant kati wilhelm seeking to add a fourth gold medal to her collection .
wilhelm , an officer in the german military , most recently took gold in the 10-kilometer pursuit in turin .
wilhelm has been crowned world champion five times in various disciplines in the last nine years and represents germany 's best hope of taking top spot in the biathlon events this year .

andrea henkel , a two-time olympic gold winner , aims to get back on top in vancouver after coming away with one silver in the turin games .
a podium sweep could be on the cards in biathlon , with olympics newcomer magdalena neuner one to look out for .
the 22-year-old bavarian became the youngest-ever overall world champion in the 2007-2008 season , having won six world championship gold medals since her debut season four years ago .
neuner has been hampered by illness in recent competitions , but as one of the fastest cross-country skiers in biathlon competition at the moment , she would be a good outside bet for an olympic medal .
bob teams looking to rediscover dominant form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre lange and kevin kuske will hope for a smooth ride in the bobsled competitions in turin , germany swept the gold medals .

in the women 's competition , sandra kiriasis and anja schneiderheinze took gold as well .
since 2006 , however , the men 's team has struggled with injuries and equipment problems .
if they overcome their troubles , they 'll likely dominate the field .
the same can be said for sandra kiriasis .
the six-time world champion is a medal favorite but has struggled in recent competitions .
she 'll need to keep up her momentum of recent weeks to replicate her previous olympics success .
superfast skeleton debutant twenty-five-year-old star marion trott will be speeding headfirst down the track in the skeleton event .
trott broke records left and right in 2009 on a sled that is basically a cafeteria tray .
she is tipped to be the one to beat , even though this is her first olympics .
trott is already a two-time world champion , having won the women 's and mixed competitions in 2009 .
germany has been mourning the fate of the country 's most decorated winter olympian , speedskater claudia pechstein .
pechstein failed to make the cut for the 2010 team in december .
the five-time olympic gold medalist had dominated headlines in 2009 over a controversial doping ban .
pechstein 's former olympic teammates will be fighting to defend the women 's title they earned in 2006 in the team pursuit .

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .

" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "

" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .

even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

they have high expectations in a number of sports , with german stars looking like favorites in many disciplines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter olympic team is confident about its strength a glittering opening ceremony at the bc place stadium featured native american music and dance , followed by a procession of participating nations .
the proceedings were touched by sadness at the death of georgian luge competitor nodar kumaritashvili , who died in a training accident on friday .
a minute of silence was observed in his honor as the olympic and canadian flag was lowered to half staff .
canadian ice hockey legend wayne gretzky and three further greats jointly lit the olympic cauldron at the opening ceremony .
gretzky was accompanied by alpine skier nancy greene , speed skater katrina lemay doan and basketball all-star steve nash in the lighting which was delayed by a technical hitch as one of the arms of the cauldron construction at bc place did not rise from the floor .
stellar record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biathlon champion kati wilhelm is going for more gold at the 2006 winter olympics in turin , germany finished top of the table with 29 medals , ahead of the united states with 25 and canada with 24 .
germany looks to be the frontrunner in the women 's biathlon with the consistently dominant kati wilhelm seeking to add a fourth gold medal to her collection .
wilhelm , an officer in the german military , most recently took gold in the 10-kilometer pursuit in turin .
wilhelm has been crowned world champion five times in various disciplines in the last nine years and represents germany 's best hope of taking top spot in the biathlon events this year .
germany full of options in biathlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea henkel wants to get back to winning ways wilhelm wo n't be the only german vying for glory with skis and rifles .
andrea henkel , a two-time olympic gold winner , aims to get back on top in vancouver after coming away with one silver in the turin games .
a podium sweep could be on the cards in biathlon , with olympics newcomer magdalena neuner one to look out for .
the 22-year-old bavarian became the youngest-ever overall world champion in the 2007-2008 season , having won six world championship gold medals since her debut season four years ago .
neuner has been hampered by illness in recent competitions , but as one of the fastest cross-country skiers in biathlon competition at the moment , she would be a good outside bet for an olympic medal .
bob teams looking to rediscover dominant form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre lange and kevin kuske will hope for a smooth ride in the bobsled competitions in turin , germany swept the gold medals .
the men 's four-man bob team , featuring rene hoppe , kevin kuske , andre lange and martin putze , scooped the top prize , while lange and kuske also won gold in the two-man run .
in the women 's competition , sandra kiriasis and anja schneiderheinze took gold as well .
since 2006 , however , the men 's team has struggled with injuries and equipment problems .
if they overcome their troubles , they 'll likely dominate the field .
the same can be said for sandra kiriasis .
the six-time world champion is a medal favorite but has struggled in recent competitions .
she 'll need to keep up her momentum of recent weeks to replicate her previous olympics success .
superfast skeleton debutant twenty-five-year-old star marion trott will be speeding headfirst down the track in the skeleton event .
trott broke records left and right in 2009 on a sled that is basically a cafeteria tray .
she is tipped to be the one to beat , even though this is her first olympics .
trott is already a two-time world champion , having won the women 's and mixed competitions in 2009 .
germany has been mourning the fate of the country 's most decorated winter olympian , speedskater claudia pechstein .
pechstein failed to make the cut for the 2010 team in december .
the five-time olympic gold medalist had dominated headlines in 2009 over a controversial doping ban .
pechstein 's former olympic teammates will be fighting to defend the women 's title they earned in 2006 in the team pursuit .

the 22-year-old bavarian became the youngest-ever overall world champion in the 2007-2008 season , having won six world championship gold medals since her debut season four years ago .

germany has been mourning the fate of the country 's most decorated winter olympian , speedskater claudia pechstein .
pechstein failed to make the cut for the 2010 team in december .
the five-time olympic gold medalist had dominated headlines in 2009 over a controversial doping ban .
pechstein 's former olympic teammates will be fighting to defend the women 's title they earned in 2006 in the team pursuit .

neuner has been hampered by illness in recent competitions , but as one of the fastest cross-country skiers in biathlon competition at the moment , she would be a good outside bet for an olympic medal .
bob teams looking to rediscover dominant form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre lange and kevin kuske will hope for a smooth ride in the bobsled competitions in turin , germany swept the gold medals .
the men 's four-man bob team , featuring rene hoppe , kevin kuske , andre lange and martin putze , scooped the top prize , while lange and kuske also won gold in the two-man run .
in the women 's competition , sandra kiriasis and anja schneiderheinze took gold as well .
since 2006 , however , the men 's team has struggled with injuries and equipment problems .
if they overcome their troubles , they 'll likely dominate the field .
the same can be said for sandra kiriasis .
the six-time world champion is a medal favorite but has struggled in recent competitions .
she 'll need to keep up her momentum of recent weeks to replicate her previous olympics success .
superfast skeleton debutant twenty-five-year-old star marion trott will be speeding headfirst down the track in the skeleton event .
trott broke records left and right in 2009 on a sled that is basically a cafeteria tray .
she is tipped to be the one to beat , even though this is her first olympics .
trott is already a two-time world champion , having won the women 's and mixed competitions in 2009 .
germany has been mourning the fate of the country 's most decorated winter olympian , speedskater claudia pechstein .
pechstein failed to make the cut for the 2010 team in december .
the five-time olympic gold medalist had dominated headlines in 2009 over a controversial doping ban .
pechstein 's former olympic teammates will be fighting to defend the women 's title they earned in 2006 in the team pursuit .

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .

" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "

the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .

with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

the bundesrat also approved a bill to improve pensions of stasi victims in the former east germany . members of the bundesrat wants tough jail sentences for individuals found guilty of female genital mutilation .
the upper house has decided that the practice should constitute a specific legal crime under german law .
under current legislation , genital mutilation is merely classed as aggravated assault with a maximum prison sentence of six months .
the bundesrat now wants to raise that to a minimum of two years .
thousands of women in germany , most of them immigrants , have suffered genital mutilation , which is still an active ritual in some parts of africa and , to a lesser extent , asia and latin america . high numbers of victims meant that germany had to take action said the justice minister for the state of hesse , joerg-uwe hahn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scales of justice would weigh up mutilation as a new crime " the victims suffer all their lives from the physical and psychological effects of female genital mutilation , " hahn said . the women 's rights organization terres des femmes says some 20,000 cases of genital mutilation are known in europe , with between 4,000 and 5,000 of these in germany . prosecution for actions abroad if written into law , the rules would also allow german prosecutors to punish genital mutilation abroad where the victim is a resident in germany .
" the respect for foreign culture can not mean that we here in germany will allow physical and emotional injury to go unpunished , " hein said .
the bundesrat has also repeated its commitment to make the arranging of forced marriages a criminal offense .
the bundestag has failed to make a decision on the issue in the past .
pensions for stasi victims the bundesrat , which represents germany 's state governments at federal level , also approved a bill that would improve pensions for stasi victims with children .
under the plans , child benefits would no longer have to be declared as income .
victims of the former east german regime and its secret police , the stasi , who spent 6 months or more in prison as political prisoners , receive a so-called ' victim 's pension ' .
this is means-tested and only applies to those on low incomes .
the new bill would allow those with children , who are just above the maximum earnings threshold , to qualify for the pension as well as the child benefits .
this latest amendment is designed to compensate those who suffered at the hands of the former east german political system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims ' pension is meant to recognise the level of political persecution in the former east germany meanwhile , those who have been convicted of serious crimes will not qualify for the ' victim 's pension ' at all .
before it is passed , the bill now has to be approved by germany 's lower house in parliament , the bundestag .
record debt also on friday , the bundesrat approved the government 's budget for 2010 .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble 's proposals allow for a record deficit of 85.8 billion euros .
the federal states that make up the bundesrat agreed that the global economic crisis that led to a 5 percent drop in gross domestic product in germany last year , makes taking on more debt inevitable .
but the state premiers have warned the government that their regional budgets can not be subjected to anymore cuts .
at the same time , they have asked the government to save 10 billion euros per year by 2016 - without the help of the regional governments. rc / ng / dpa / epd / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with h.e. dr. john paul grech , the ambassador of malta to germany , on the issue , the role of the eu and the european asylum support office . his excellency dr. john paul grech has been the ambassador of malta to germany since october 2005 .
prior to that , he occupied various positions in the ministry of foreign affairs , including that of a special envoy of the government of malta to the eu .
dw : how has malta coped with illegal immigration from africa ?
john paul grech : malta has throughout the years received immigrants in a way that reflects its international obligations .
it has done its best in order to adhere to its international obligations .
given its limited resources , malta refers this problem to the european union and has been very active to put the question of illegal immigration on the agenda of the european union .
we have succeeded in that , and part of that work has been also the establishment of the pact for immigration and asylum within the european union .
how can the eu help malta tackle illegal immigration from africa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his excellency , dr. john paul grech , ambassador of malta to germany malta has been working towards establishing the principle of burden-sharing .
malta considers this to be a phenomenon , which is of interest to europe .
therefore , it has approached the issue from a two-pronged viewpoint .
on the one hand , it is very much in favor of adhering to our international obligations and promoting legal migration ; and on the other hand , it is very much aware that the european union has to embrace its responsibilities in assisting malta in the context of burden-sharing .
the eu has chosen malta to host the european asylum support office -lrb- easo -rrb- .
what is the reaction in malta ?
we are extremely pleased that malta has been chosen to host the easo , which is an office meant to address the problem of illegal immigration , tackle the administrative side of it , and also work within the european union in order to address this issue in a more constructive manner .
it is a point of satisfaction that malta has been chosen because it reflects that the european union sees malta as being at the heart of the problem .
it is receiving an enormous amount of immigrants , and therefore its experience and hands-on knowledge of what this is all about probably has been the reason why the european union chose malta to host the easo .
since 2004 , amnesty international has repeatedly condemned immigrant detention centers for being " overcrowded and characterized by poor hygiene and inadequate healthcare . "
what is being done to improve the conditions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are often held in detention centers with questionable standards well , malta has been very transparent .
we have had several international authorities coming over to visit us to see the context of the problem as it is affecting malta .
we have always maintained that help was needed given our limitations .
in the context of international cooperation and assistance from the european union , we have been doing our very best to improve conditions .
we can safely say that we can address this issue even better if our pleas to the international community , in particular the european union , are heard and the assistance is forthcoming .
what is being done to ensure that migrants who obtain the right to remain in malta are successfully integrated into the society ?
well , all efforts .
first of all , one has to see that malta has a history of hospitality .
it even folds within the ambit of its characteristics as a country with roman catholic values .
we do our best to see that those that are waiting for their own processes to be finalized are extended all the amenities required in the context or possibility .
malta does its very best in order to safeguard and guarantee that these processes are done in the most expeditious way possible .

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

the track , however , is to be changed . the walls will be raised at turn 16 of the course , where 21 year-old georgian nodar kumaritashvili lost control and bounced over the rim of the track straight into a metal pole . " this was done as a preventative measure , " the international luge federation -lrb- fil -rrb- said in a statement late on friday , february 12 , " in order to avoid that such an extremely exceptional accident could occur again . " the fil will resume men 's training on saturday , with two full training runs before medal competition takes place on sunday . " this is a very sad day , " the head of the international olympic committee , jacques rogge , said at the opening ceremony .
" the ioc is in deep mourning .
here you have a young athlete who lost his life pursuing his passion .
he had a dream to compete in the olympic games , he trained hard and he had this fatal accident .
i have no words to say what we feel . " the luge has always been considered one of the most dangerous disciplines in the winter games , as competitors hurl themselves feet-first on a small sled down icy descents at speeds as high as 145 kilometers -lrb- 90 miles -rrb- per hour . bildunterschrift : georgian athletes paid homage to their teammate teammates ' mark of respect " this is the most serious thing that can happen in sport , " the german president of the fil , josef fendt , said .
" our thoughts , and those of the entire luge community , are with those most closely touched by this tragedy . " there was a sombre opening ceremony for kumaritashvili 's georgian teammates , who walked out at the bce stadium wearing black scarves . an investigation into the circumstances was launched , and experts concluded that the accident had not been caused by track deficiencies .
however , they did recommend altering the layout at the exit of turn 16 to improve safety . the investigation said that nodar kumaritashvili was on a poor line on the exit of turn 15 , despite his efforts to compensate , he was n't able to get a good entrance into turn 16 , causing him to career off the track . the whistler sliding center 's luge descent is widely considered one of the most demanding in the world .
a number of training crashes had already taken place ahead of the games . msh / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "

dw spoke with h.e. dr. john paul grech , the ambassador of malta to germany , on the issue , the role of the eu and the european asylum support office . his excellency dr. john paul grech has been the ambassador of malta to germany since october 2005 .
prior to that , he occupied various positions in the ministry of foreign affairs , including that of a special envoy of the government of malta to the eu .
dw : how has malta coped with illegal immigration from africa ?
john paul grech : malta has throughout the years received immigrants in a way that reflects its international obligations .
it has done its best in order to adhere to its international obligations .
given its limited resources , malta refers this problem to the european union and has been very active to put the question of illegal immigration on the agenda of the european union .
we have succeeded in that , and part of that work has been also the establishment of the pact for immigration and asylum within the european union .
how can the eu help malta tackle illegal immigration from africa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his excellency , dr. john paul grech , ambassador of malta to germany malta has been working towards establishing the principle of burden-sharing .
malta considers this to be a phenomenon , which is of interest to europe .
therefore , it has approached the issue from a two-pronged viewpoint .
on the one hand , it is very much in favor of adhering to our international obligations and promoting legal migration ; and on the other hand , it is very much aware that the european union has to embrace its responsibilities in assisting malta in the context of burden-sharing .
the eu has chosen malta to host the european asylum support office -lrb- easo -rrb- .
what is the reaction in malta ?
we are extremely pleased that malta has been chosen to host the easo , which is an office meant to address the problem of illegal immigration , tackle the administrative side of it , and also work within the european union in order to address this issue in a more constructive manner .
it is a point of satisfaction that malta has been chosen because it reflects that the european union sees malta as being at the heart of the problem .
it is receiving an enormous amount of immigrants , and therefore its experience and hands-on knowledge of what this is all about probably has been the reason why the european union chose malta to host the easo .
since 2004 , amnesty international has repeatedly condemned immigrant detention centers for being " overcrowded and characterized by poor hygiene and inadequate healthcare . "
what is being done to improve the conditions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are often held in detention centers with questionable standards well , malta has been very transparent .
we have had several international authorities coming over to visit us to see the context of the problem as it is affecting malta .
we have always maintained that help was needed given our limitations .
in the context of international cooperation and assistance from the european union , we have been doing our very best to improve conditions .
we can safely say that we can address this issue even better if our pleas to the international community , in particular the european union , are heard and the assistance is forthcoming .
what is being done to ensure that migrants who obtain the right to remain in malta are successfully integrated into the society ?
well , all efforts .
first of all , one has to see that malta has a history of hospitality .
it even folds within the ambit of its characteristics as a country with roman catholic values .
we do our best to see that those that are waiting for their own processes to be finalized are extended all the amenities required in the context or possibility .
malta does its very best in order to safeguard and guarantee that these processes are done in the most expeditious way possible .

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .
roettgen , however , also said that safety issues could lead to changes in the dates of disassembly . the three dissenters - markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden wuerttemberg , and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse - advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .

" this whole debate shows , that even after 40 years , nuclear power still has n't gained public acceptance in germany , " roettgen told the newspaper , adding that this was a good reason to try to quickly replace it .

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 13.02.2010 demonstrators thwart neo-nazi bid to stage dresden bombing rally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human chain was formed in an organized show of defiance demonstrators in dresden successfully prevented right-wing extremists from staging a march to commemorate the city being firebombed .
others gathered to form a symbolic human chain against the neo-nazis . left-wing protesters thwarted neo-nazis in their efforts to stage a " mourning march " for victims on the 65th anniversary of allied incendiary bombing raids on the city of dresden . at least 5,000 right-wing extremists wearing black gathered at the city ’ s neustadt station , hoping to stage a procession through city streets . opponents of the rally gathered in streets around the station to prevent neo-nazis from reaching their rallying point . police urged the neo-nazis to cancel the march , saying they could not guarantee the safety of participants along the route .
the procession was eventually called off late in the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden was devastated by the bombing raids in 1945 an anti-fascist group , dresden without nazis , which included politicians and trades unionists , had earlier called on city residents to block the rally in a peaceful way . " we have for the first time succeeded in preventing the biggest neo-nazi march in europe , " said alliance spokeswoman lena roth . water cannons used by police police said there had been isolated clashes between the two sides and at one point water cannons had been used .
witnesses said that bottles and fireworks were thrown by both sides at each other , as well as at the police . police spokesman thomas geithner said up to 6,000 far-right supporters from around europe had gathered to take part in what organizers called a " mourning march . " officers were brought in from all over germany to prevent the clashes and made as many as 30 arrests on both sides . accusations of exploitation the bombing raid on dresden began on the night of february 13 , 1945 , killing some 25,000 people and destroying much of the historic city .
opponents of the march claim that neo-nazis are exploiting the wartime deaths for their own ends . on the other side of the elbe river , a " human chain " of 10,000 people formed in a symbolic action called for by mayor helma orosz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial service to mark the anniversary was organized at dresden 's frauenkirche " let 's turn dresden into a peaceful and open city , a bastion against intolerance and stupidity .
we will confront nazis young and old who are trying to exploit this day of mourning , " orosz said . critics of the world war ii bombing raid claim it was unnecessary because germany was already close to defeat .
the city has only been restored to its pre-war glory in the last 10 years . a series of concerts and memorial services were arranged for the evening , including one at the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , which has been rebuilt .
failed attempt to ban the march the right-wing march was organized by a group known as the junge landsmannschaft ostdeutschland -lrb- young national association of east germany -rrb- , or jlo , which is supported by germany 's right-wing party , the npd .

the procession was eventually called off late in the afternoon .

" we have for the first time succeeded in preventing the biggest neo-nazi march in europe , " said alliance spokeswoman lena roth . water cannons used by police police said there had been isolated clashes between the two sides and at one point water cannons had been used .
witnesses said that bottles and fireworks were thrown by both sides at each other , as well as at the police . police spokesman thomas geithner said up to 6,000 far-right supporters from around europe had gathered to take part in what organizers called a " mourning march . " officers were brought in from all over germany to prevent the clashes and made as many as 30 arrests on both sides . accusations of exploitation the bombing raid on dresden began on the night of february 13 , 1945 , killing some 25,000 people and destroying much of the historic city .
opponents of the march claim that neo-nazis are exploiting the wartime deaths for their own ends . on the other side of the elbe river , a " human chain " of 10,000 people formed in a symbolic action called for by mayor helma orosz .

the city has only been restored to its pre-war glory in the last 10 years . a series of concerts and memorial services were arranged for the evening , including one at the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , which has been rebuilt .
failed attempt to ban the march the right-wing march was organized by a group known as the junge landsmannschaft ostdeutschland -lrb- young national association of east germany -rrb- , or jlo , which is supported by germany 's right-wing party , the npd .
german neo-nazis claim the carpet bombing of dresden at the end of world war ii was a war crime and have been holding rallies since the 1990s to protest what they call the " bombing holocaust . "
germany 's right-wing scene has been staging demonstrations in dresden on february 13 for over a decade .
the city of dresden had tried to have the march banned yet a saxony state court ruled against a ban , saying that would have breeched german constitutional laws allowing public assembly. rc / cmk / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "

shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .

" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .

the track , however , is to be changed . the walls will be raised at turn 16 of the course , where 21 year-old georgian nodar kumaritashvili lost control and bounced over the rim of the track straight into a metal pole . " this was done as a preventative measure , " the international luge federation -lrb- fil -rrb- said in a statement late on friday , february 12 , " in order to avoid that such an extremely exceptional accident could occur again . " the fil will resume men 's training on saturday , with two full training runs before medal competition takes place on sunday . " this is a very sad day , " the head of the international olympic committee , jacques rogge , said at the opening ceremony .
" the ioc is in deep mourning .
here you have a young athlete who lost his life pursuing his passion .
he had a dream to compete in the olympic games , he trained hard and he had this fatal accident .

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "

fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

" officers were brought in from all over germany to prevent the clashes and made as many as 30 arrests on both sides . accusations of exploitation the bombing raid on dresden began on the night of february 13 , 1945 , killing some 25,000 people and destroying much of the historic city .

failed attempt to ban the march the right-wing march was organized by a group known as the junge landsmannschaft ostdeutschland -lrb- young national association of east germany -rrb- , or jlo , which is supported by germany 's right-wing party , the npd .
german neo-nazis claim the carpet bombing of dresden at the end of world war ii was a war crime and have been holding rallies since the 1990s to protest what they call the " bombing holocaust . "
germany 's right-wing scene has been staging demonstrations in dresden on february 13 for over a decade .
the city of dresden had tried to have the march banned yet a saxony state court ruled against a ban , saying that would have breeched german constitutional laws allowing public assembly. rc / cmk / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundesrat also approved a bill to improve pensions of stasi victims in the former east germany . members of the bundesrat wants tough jail sentences for individuals found guilty of female genital mutilation .
the upper house has decided that the practice should constitute a specific legal crime under german law .
under current legislation , genital mutilation is merely classed as aggravated assault with a maximum prison sentence of six months .
the bundesrat now wants to raise that to a minimum of two years .
thousands of women in germany , most of them immigrants , have suffered genital mutilation , which is still an active ritual in some parts of africa and , to a lesser extent , asia and latin america . high numbers of victims meant that germany had to take action said the justice minister for the state of hesse , joerg-uwe hahn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scales of justice would weigh up mutilation as a new crime " the victims suffer all their lives from the physical and psychological effects of female genital mutilation , " hahn said . the women 's rights organization terres des femmes says some 20,000 cases of genital mutilation are known in europe , with between 4,000 and 5,000 of these in germany . prosecution for actions abroad if written into law , the rules would also allow german prosecutors to punish genital mutilation abroad where the victim is a resident in germany .
" the respect for foreign culture can not mean that we here in germany will allow physical and emotional injury to go unpunished , " hein said .
the bundesrat has also repeated its commitment to make the arranging of forced marriages a criminal offense .
the bundestag has failed to make a decision on the issue in the past .
pensions for stasi victims the bundesrat , which represents germany 's state governments at federal level , also approved a bill that would improve pensions for stasi victims with children .
under the plans , child benefits would no longer have to be declared as income .
victims of the former east german regime and its secret police , the stasi , who spent 6 months or more in prison as political prisoners , receive a so-called ' victim 's pension ' .
this is means-tested and only applies to those on low incomes .
the new bill would allow those with children , who are just above the maximum earnings threshold , to qualify for the pension as well as the child benefits .
this latest amendment is designed to compensate those who suffered at the hands of the former east german political system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims ' pension is meant to recognise the level of political persecution in the former east germany meanwhile , those who have been convicted of serious crimes will not qualify for the ' victim 's pension ' at all .
before it is passed , the bill now has to be approved by germany 's lower house in parliament , the bundestag .
record debt also on friday , the bundesrat approved the government 's budget for 2010 .
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble 's proposals allow for a record deficit of 85.8 billion euros .
the federal states that make up the bundesrat agreed that the global economic crisis that led to a 5 percent drop in gross domestic product in germany last year , makes taking on more debt inevitable .
but the state premiers have warned the government that their regional budgets can not be subjected to anymore cuts .
at the same time , they have asked the government to save 10 billion euros per year by 2016 - without the help of the regional governments. rc / ng / dpa / epd / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have high expectations in a number of sports , with german stars looking like favorites in many disciplines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter olympic team is confident about its strength a glittering opening ceremony at the bc place stadium featured native american music and dance , followed by a procession of participating nations .
the proceedings were touched by sadness at the death of georgian luge competitor nodar kumaritashvili , who died in a training accident on friday .
a minute of silence was observed in his honor as the olympic and canadian flag was lowered to half staff .
canadian ice hockey legend wayne gretzky and three further greats jointly lit the olympic cauldron at the opening ceremony .
gretzky was accompanied by alpine skier nancy greene , speed skater katrina lemay doan and basketball all-star steve nash in the lighting which was delayed by a technical hitch as one of the arms of the cauldron construction at bc place did not rise from the floor .
stellar record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biathlon champion kati wilhelm is going for more gold at the 2006 winter olympics in turin , germany finished top of the table with 29 medals , ahead of the united states with 25 and canada with 24 .
germany looks to be the frontrunner in the women 's biathlon with the consistently dominant kati wilhelm seeking to add a fourth gold medal to her collection .
wilhelm , an officer in the german military , most recently took gold in the 10-kilometer pursuit in turin .
wilhelm has been crowned world champion five times in various disciplines in the last nine years and represents germany 's best hope of taking top spot in the biathlon events this year .
germany full of options in biathlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea henkel wants to get back to winning ways wilhelm wo n't be the only german vying for glory with skis and rifles .
andrea henkel , a two-time olympic gold winner , aims to get back on top in vancouver after coming away with one silver in the turin games .
a podium sweep could be on the cards in biathlon , with olympics newcomer magdalena neuner one to look out for .
the 22-year-old bavarian became the youngest-ever overall world champion in the 2007-2008 season , having won six world championship gold medals since her debut season four years ago .
neuner has been hampered by illness in recent competitions , but as one of the fastest cross-country skiers in biathlon competition at the moment , she would be a good outside bet for an olympic medal .
bob teams looking to rediscover dominant form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre lange and kevin kuske will hope for a smooth ride in the bobsled competitions in turin , germany swept the gold medals .
the men 's four-man bob team , featuring rene hoppe , kevin kuske , andre lange and martin putze , scooped the top prize , while lange and kuske also won gold in the two-man run .
in the women 's competition , sandra kiriasis and anja schneiderheinze took gold as well .
since 2006 , however , the men 's team has struggled with injuries and equipment problems .
if they overcome their troubles , they 'll likely dominate the field .
the same can be said for sandra kiriasis .
the six-time world champion is a medal favorite but has struggled in recent competitions .
she 'll need to keep up her momentum of recent weeks to replicate her previous olympics success .
superfast skeleton debutant twenty-five-year-old star marion trott will be speeding headfirst down the track in the skeleton event .
trott broke records left and right in 2009 on a sled that is basically a cafeteria tray .
she is tipped to be the one to beat , even though this is her first olympics .
trott is already a two-time world champion , having won the women 's and mixed competitions in 2009 .
germany has been mourning the fate of the country 's most decorated winter olympian , speedskater claudia pechstein .
pechstein failed to make the cut for the 2010 team in december .
the five-time olympic gold medalist had dominated headlines in 2009 over a controversial doping ban .
pechstein 's former olympic teammates will be fighting to defend the women 's title they earned in 2006 in the team pursuit .

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .

but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .

a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .

" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

most of these were forced out of business by supermarkets , but the concept is now being revived , with a modern spin . heinz frey makes a coffee first thing in the morning after opening his store in barmen , a small rural village in the west of germany .
he knows it 'll be a busy day - because his is the only shop in town . " you can buy all you need for daily life here , food , fresh products , fruits and everything you need , " he says as he sips from his cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz frey , right , co-founded the store in barmen-jülich until this store opened , barmen had no other business .
but frey and other locals rallied to bring back to the township the old german institution of the tante emma laden , or aunty emma store , the german equivalent of the corner shop .
frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

frey says the shop in barmen was opened not only out of nostalgia for the way village life used to be , but also because locals wanted to help their community reengage .
" i think the tante emma concept is a great idea , " barmen resident adriane says .
" when i was growing up we had a tante emma shop , and it was a meeting point for locals .
there were also things for kids , you could eat there , and it helped you save money . "
not only do the locals no longer have to drive long distances to make their purchases , but they actually get an extra value by shopping in town .
" the personal contact that locals can have through this shop is very important , " another resident , paula , says .
rural revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town shop sells meats , baked goods and fresh fruits and vegetables for decades , the tanta emma shop was a central meeting point for locals , where they could gossip and pick up groceries at the same time .
it was a key pillar of village life .
but these stores became an endangered species once large supermarkets moved in .
in recent decades these mom-and-pop stores have edged ever closer to extinction .
but a movement was born in barmen to revive the tante emma concept in small villages with some new services and features .
" now you can get a driver 's license , drink a coffee , and have a cultural event here , " frey says .
the shop in barmen is called dorv by its german acronym , which translates roughly to service and local all-round supply store .
it was set up entirely using donations from barmen 's 2,400 locals .
with the money , frey and his partners were able to take over an old bank building , renovate it , and buy enough local produce to get started .
any profits are redirected back into the business .
the shop also offers medical services , tourism information , and a place just to catch up and have a chat .
frey says it is this clustering of services under one roof that makes the modern tante emma concept work , frey says .
tante emma 's future because the barmen shop has proved to be such a success , heinz frey and his colleagues now run a consultancy business educating other communities on how they can open and manage their own village shops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rewe 's new temma shop is much larger than a traditional tante emma store " we are going around germany and in 17 villages there are people doing the same , " frey says , adding that he expects the first community stores in other villages to open this year .
even large supermarket chains are catching on to the revival .
a few hours from barmen in the sprawling city of cologne , german retail giant rewe has opened a prototype " temma " store , a play on the name tante emma .
at nearly 1,000 square meters , the new store is a far cry from a traditional , tiny tante emma , but the the idea is to have a more olden-style organic market that services the local community .
" we have two subjects we took over from tante emma , " said christiane speck , who heads the new concept store .
" one is the store being a meeting point , and the other is the personal service and atmosphere between customers and people working here . "
for some small villages , the return of the tante emma represents a chance for renewal - an opportunity for a community to reengage itself , and learn some lessons from how things were done in years past .

they have high expectations in a number of sports , with german stars looking like favorites in many disciplines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter olympic team is confident about its strength a glittering opening ceremony at the bc place stadium featured native american music and dance , followed by a procession of participating nations .
the proceedings were touched by sadness at the death of georgian luge competitor nodar kumaritashvili , who died in a training accident on friday .
a minute of silence was observed in his honor as the olympic and canadian flag was lowered to half staff .
canadian ice hockey legend wayne gretzky and three further greats jointly lit the olympic cauldron at the opening ceremony .
gretzky was accompanied by alpine skier nancy greene , speed skater katrina lemay doan and basketball all-star steve nash in the lighting which was delayed by a technical hitch as one of the arms of the cauldron construction at bc place did not rise from the floor .
stellar record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biathlon champion kati wilhelm is going for more gold at the 2006 winter olympics in turin , germany finished top of the table with 29 medals , ahead of the united states with 25 and canada with 24 .
germany looks to be the frontrunner in the women 's biathlon with the consistently dominant kati wilhelm seeking to add a fourth gold medal to her collection .
wilhelm , an officer in the german military , most recently took gold in the 10-kilometer pursuit in turin .
wilhelm has been crowned world champion five times in various disciplines in the last nine years and represents germany 's best hope of taking top spot in the biathlon events this year .
germany full of options in biathlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea henkel wants to get back to winning ways wilhelm wo n't be the only german vying for glory with skis and rifles .
andrea henkel , a two-time olympic gold winner , aims to get back on top in vancouver after coming away with one silver in the turin games .
a podium sweep could be on the cards in biathlon , with olympics newcomer magdalena neuner one to look out for .
the 22-year-old bavarian became the youngest-ever overall world champion in the 2007-2008 season , having won six world championship gold medals since her debut season four years ago .
neuner has been hampered by illness in recent competitions , but as one of the fastest cross-country skiers in biathlon competition at the moment , she would be a good outside bet for an olympic medal .
bob teams looking to rediscover dominant form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre lange and kevin kuske will hope for a smooth ride in the bobsled competitions in turin , germany swept the gold medals .
the men 's four-man bob team , featuring rene hoppe , kevin kuske , andre lange and martin putze , scooped the top prize , while lange and kuske also won gold in the two-man run .
in the women 's competition , sandra kiriasis and anja schneiderheinze took gold as well .
since 2006 , however , the men 's team has struggled with injuries and equipment problems .
if they overcome their troubles , they 'll likely dominate the field .
the same can be said for sandra kiriasis .
the six-time world champion is a medal favorite but has struggled in recent competitions .
she 'll need to keep up her momentum of recent weeks to replicate her previous olympics success .
superfast skeleton debutant twenty-five-year-old star marion trott will be speeding headfirst down the track in the skeleton event .
trott broke records left and right in 2009 on a sled that is basically a cafeteria tray .
she is tipped to be the one to beat , even though this is her first olympics .
trott is already a two-time world champion , having won the women 's and mixed competitions in 2009 .
germany has been mourning the fate of the country 's most decorated winter olympian , speedskater claudia pechstein .
pechstein failed to make the cut for the 2010 team in december .
the five-time olympic gold medalist had dominated headlines in 2009 over a controversial doping ban .
pechstein 's former olympic teammates will be fighting to defend the women 's title they earned in 2006 in the team pursuit .

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .
roettgen , however , also said that safety issues could lead to changes in the dates of disassembly . the three dissenters - markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden wuerttemberg , and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse - advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
all of them represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal . a hasty withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public largely oppose nuclear power while the opposition in germany - especially the green party and the social democrats - are calling for a near immediate shut down of nuclear power plants , chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and her liberal fdp coalition ally have argued that nuclear power should be used to bridge the gap until renewable power is more widely used , and cost-efficient . but nuclear power remains very unpopular amongst the german population , and the environment minister suggested this was part of his motivation to move away from atomic energy as quickly as possible . " this whole debate shows , that even after 40 years , nuclear power still has n't gained public acceptance in germany , " roettgen told the newspaper , adding that this was a good reason to try to quickly replace it . " i think the christian democratic union … should think carefully about whether we want to make nuclear power one of our unique selling points , " roettgen said .

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

dw spoke with h.e. dr. john paul grech , the ambassador of malta to germany , on the issue , the role of the eu and the european asylum support office . his excellency dr. john paul grech has been the ambassador of malta to germany since october 2005 .
prior to that , he occupied various positions in the ministry of foreign affairs , including that of a special envoy of the government of malta to the eu .
dw : how has malta coped with illegal immigration from africa ?
john paul grech : malta has throughout the years received immigrants in a way that reflects its international obligations .
it has done its best in order to adhere to its international obligations .
given its limited resources , malta refers this problem to the european union and has been very active to put the question of illegal immigration on the agenda of the european union .
we have succeeded in that , and part of that work has been also the establishment of the pact for immigration and asylum within the european union .
how can the eu help malta tackle illegal immigration from africa ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his excellency , dr. john paul grech , ambassador of malta to germany malta has been working towards establishing the principle of burden-sharing .
malta considers this to be a phenomenon , which is of interest to europe .
therefore , it has approached the issue from a two-pronged viewpoint .
on the one hand , it is very much in favor of adhering to our international obligations and promoting legal migration ; and on the other hand , it is very much aware that the european union has to embrace its responsibilities in assisting malta in the context of burden-sharing .
the eu has chosen malta to host the european asylum support office -lrb- easo -rrb- .
what is the reaction in malta ?
we are extremely pleased that malta has been chosen to host the easo , which is an office meant to address the problem of illegal immigration , tackle the administrative side of it , and also work within the european union in order to address this issue in a more constructive manner .
it is a point of satisfaction that malta has been chosen because it reflects that the european union sees malta as being at the heart of the problem .
it is receiving an enormous amount of immigrants , and therefore its experience and hands-on knowledge of what this is all about probably has been the reason why the european union chose malta to host the easo .
since 2004 , amnesty international has repeatedly condemned immigrant detention centers for being " overcrowded and characterized by poor hygiene and inadequate healthcare . "
what is being done to improve the conditions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are often held in detention centers with questionable standards well , malta has been very transparent .
we have had several international authorities coming over to visit us to see the context of the problem as it is affecting malta .
we have always maintained that help was needed given our limitations .
in the context of international cooperation and assistance from the european union , we have been doing our very best to improve conditions .
we can safely say that we can address this issue even better if our pleas to the international community , in particular the european union , are heard and the assistance is forthcoming .
what is being done to ensure that migrants who obtain the right to remain in malta are successfully integrated into the society ?
well , all efforts .
first of all , one has to see that malta has a history of hospitality .
it even folds within the ambit of its characteristics as a country with roman catholic values .
we do our best to see that those that are waiting for their own processes to be finalized are extended all the amenities required in the context or possibility .
malta does its very best in order to safeguard and guarantee that these processes are done in the most expeditious way possible .

opposition leader viktor yanukovych narrowly won last sunday 's vote by 3.5 percentage points in a preliminary count , but tymoshenko has yet to concede defeat .
" i want to clearly state : yanukovych is not our president , " she said in a televised broadcast to the nation .
" whatever happens in the future , he will never become the legitimately elected president of ukraine . "
in her first public appearance since the election , tymoshenko urged ukranians to support her legal battle to overturn the election results . she did not , however , call on them to take to the streets in mass protests as she did when she successfully challenged the results of the 2004 election in the orange revolution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 13.02.2010 berliners brave the elements to experience cinema history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the first time in decades the film was shown in full film fans braved snow for an outdoor screening of fritz lang 's legendary movie ' metropolis ' in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .
roettgen , however , also said that safety issues could lead to changes in the dates of disassembly . the three dissenters - markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden wuerttemberg , and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse - advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
all of them represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal . a hasty withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public largely oppose nuclear power while the opposition in germany - especially the green party and the social democrats - are calling for a near immediate shut down of nuclear power plants , chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and her liberal fdp coalition ally have argued that nuclear power should be used to bridge the gap until renewable power is more widely used , and cost-efficient . but nuclear power remains very unpopular amongst the german population , and the environment minister suggested this was part of his motivation to move away from atomic energy as quickly as possible . " this whole debate shows , that even after 40 years , nuclear power still has n't gained public acceptance in germany , " roettgen told the newspaper , adding that this was a good reason to try to quickly replace it . " i think the christian democratic union … should think carefully about whether we want to make nuclear power one of our unique selling points , " roettgen said .
" it would be better for people to associate us with the economic and ecological modernization of this country . " " we should not bind our public approval too closely with the continued , uninterrupted usage of nuclear power plants , " he said . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

the track , however , is to be changed . the walls will be raised at turn 16 of the course , where 21 year-old georgian nodar kumaritashvili lost control and bounced over the rim of the track straight into a metal pole . " this was done as a preventative measure , " the international luge federation -lrb- fil -rrb- said in a statement late on friday , february 12 , " in order to avoid that such an extremely exceptional accident could occur again . " the fil will resume men 's training on saturday , with two full training runs before medal competition takes place on sunday .

" the ioc is in deep mourning .

he had a dream to compete in the olympic games , he trained hard and he had this fatal accident .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 13.02.2010 berliners brave the elements to experience cinema history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the first time in decades the film was shown in full film fans braved snow for an outdoor screening of fritz lang 's legendary movie ' metropolis ' in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .
" it 's great , " said one shivering spectator .
" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .
it 's really the kind of film we want to have for such a celebration . "

the 1927 classic included 25 minutes from the original that were feared lost forever . the brandenburg gate has long since been a popular site for all kinds of events , whether it be political speeches , rock concerts or cultural festivals .
friday night saw the spacious square at the gate transformed into an outdoor cinema for a gala screening of the legendary science fiction film " metropolis " .
fritz lang 's seminal work was first released in 1927 .
an epic tale set in a sprawling futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , cutting edge special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has since become an acclaimed example of early german cinema .
what makes this year 's screening so special is the fact that experts believe that for the first time in more than 80 years , spectators have the chance to view the film in the original version which lang intended .
25 minutes of extra footage last year , a surprise discovery in the museo del cine in buenos aries recovered a 16mm duplicate of the original " metropolis " ; a find which restored around 25 minutes of extra footage to the 2001 " long " version .
the film was immediately transferred to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation for verification .
they confirmed the film was genuine , a statement which rocked the film world .
work began immediately on the restoration and for this , music played a key role .
bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 enthusiastic film fans came to see the restored original version at the brandenburg gate " first of all you have to find out where to put these scenes .
when it was edited they just took one sequence out , " explained eberhard junkersdorf , president of the board of trustees at the f. w. murnau foundation .
" they have taken sequences out here , some shots -lsb- were -rsb- taken out there and it was only by having the original score by gottfried huppertz that it was possible because there were notes made , there were remarks made for every scene .
this is fritz lang 's film and it is understandable now . "
' too sophisticated ' for 1920 's audience for a film which is now so highly esteemed , it is curious to note that " metropolis " was not a success when it was first released .
shot at the famous babelsberg film studios over a period of 17 months the film at the time was the most expensive german movie ever made .
german cinema was especially buoyant in the twenties with iconic movies such as " nosferatu " , " the cabinet of dr. caligari " and " dr. mabuse " all appearing throughout the decade , putting german film and filmmakers on the map .
" metropolis " should have been another such event picture , a skillful mix of experimental film techniques combined with political and social commentary resulting in healthy box office receipts .
it was not to be .
" it was too sophisticated , " said werner sudendorf , head of collections at the deutsche kinemathek , the museum for film and television in berlin .
" when you saw ' metropolis ' you had to think about it .
and who likes that ?
it was not an easy movie .
in ' metropolis ' you have the modern city , you have the robot , you have the destruction of the city , you have airplanes going through the city , it 's everything .
so it 's a babylon of different ideas . "
production company ufa opted to screen " metropolis " in only one berlin cinema for a disappointing four-week run .
american exhibitors edited the film themselves ahead of the us release to cut what they saw as extraneous material and to reduce the weighty running time to something more palatable .
new version is lang 's director 's cut in an era where exhibitors threw artistic respect to the wind and were not averse to making their own edits to films it is no surprise that several curtailed versions of " metropolis " have been in circulation over the years .
lang 's director 's cut has long since been the much sought-after holy grail of silent cinema .
bildunterschrift : an epic tale set in a futuristic dystopia featuring expressionist camera work , special effects and ambitious set design , " metropolis " has long since been an acclaimed example of early german cinema the sudden unexpected discovery of the film in south america ties in nicely with the party atmosphere already taking place at this year 's berlinale .
the festival is celebrating its 60th birthday , a milestone anniversary for one of europe 's key film meets .
for an event dedicated to promoting the best new talent the world has to offer , it seems somehow fitting to roll back the clock and give a classic from the early days of cinema pride of place within the program .
and the berlinale pulled out all the stops .
" metropolis " was premiered in the opulent friedrichstadtpalast with the original score performed live by the berlin symphony orchestra , conducted by frank strobel .
broadcasted on tv and at brandenburg gate as a sign of the berlinale becoming less exclusive and perhaps as an indicator of how significant " metropolis " is in german cinema history , the film was simultaneously screened on cultural tv channel arte as well as being broadcast live at the brandenburg gate .
braving below-zero temperatures , hundreds of film fans showed up complete with blankets and flasks of coffee to sit and watch this historic moment .

" maybe it would 've been better to do this in summer but everyone is making the best of it and having a good time . "
" if you think about the classics of the that era , you have buster keaton 's ' the general ' , murnau 's ' nosferatu ' , but the top of the pile is always going to be fritz lang 's ' metropolis ' , " said another through chattering teeth .
berlinale festival director dieter kosslick sees this year 's screening of " metropolis " as something different .
" you could say it 's a birthday present .

germany 's environment minister said that no efforts should be wasted to replace nuclear technology as fast as possible , but german states with atomic power facilities are pushing for a 20-year delay . the conservative regional environment ministers from the states of bavaria , baden wuerttemberg and hesse said in a joint press conference on friday , february 12 , that germany will need nuclear power for considerably longer before renewable energies are ready to viably replace the technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen is accused of flip-flopping on government policy " we do n't think that -lsb- environment minister -rsb- norbert roettgen 's sums add up , " said regional environment minister tanya goenner . in an interview with the daily paper sueddeutsche zeitung earlier this week , roettgen advocated extending the already limited running times of german nuclear power plants by a further eight years . this would mean german atomic energy plants should shut down 40 years after they started operating , a deadline ranging between 2015 and 2029 for various plants across the country .
roettgen , however , also said that safety issues could lead to changes in the dates of disassembly . the three dissenters - markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden wuerttemberg , and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse - advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
all of them represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal . a hasty withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public largely oppose nuclear power while the opposition in germany - especially the green party and the social democrats - are calling for a near immediate shut down of nuclear power plants , chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and her liberal fdp coalition ally have argued that nuclear power should be used to bridge the gap until renewable power is more widely used , and cost-efficient . but nuclear power remains very unpopular amongst the german population , and the environment minister suggested this was part of his motivation to move away from atomic energy as quickly as possible . " this whole debate shows , that even after 40 years , nuclear power still has n't gained public acceptance in germany , " roettgen told the newspaper , adding that this was a good reason to try to quickly replace it . " i think the christian democratic union … should think carefully about whether we want to make nuclear power one of our unique selling points , " roettgen said .
" it would be better for people to associate us with the economic and ecological modernization of this country . " " we should not bind our public approval too closely with the continued , uninterrupted usage of nuclear power plants , " he said . msh / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others gathered to form a symbolic human chain against the neo-nazis . left-wing protesters thwarted neo-nazis in their efforts to stage a " mourning march " for victims on the 65th anniversary of allied incendiary bombing raids on the city of dresden . at least 5,000 right-wing extremists wearing black gathered at the city ’ s neustadt station , hoping to stage a procession through city streets . opponents of the rally gathered in streets around the station to prevent neo-nazis from reaching their rallying point . police urged the neo-nazis to cancel the march , saying they could not guarantee the safety of participants along the route .
the procession was eventually called off late in the afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden was devastated by the bombing raids in 1945 an anti-fascist group , dresden without nazis , which included politicians and trades unionists , had earlier called on city residents to block the rally in a peaceful way . " we have for the first time succeeded in preventing the biggest neo-nazi march in europe , " said alliance spokeswoman lena roth . water cannons used by police police said there had been isolated clashes between the two sides and at one point water cannons had been used .
witnesses said that bottles and fireworks were thrown by both sides at each other , as well as at the police . police spokesman thomas geithner said up to 6,000 far-right supporters from around europe had gathered to take part in what organizers called a " mourning march . " officers were brought in from all over germany to prevent the clashes and made as many as 30 arrests on both sides . accusations of exploitation the bombing raid on dresden began on the night of february 13 , 1945 , killing some 25,000 people and destroying much of the historic city .
opponents of the march claim that neo-nazis are exploiting the wartime deaths for their own ends . on the other side of the elbe river , a " human chain " of 10,000 people formed in a symbolic action called for by mayor helma orosz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial service to mark the anniversary was organized at dresden 's frauenkirche " let 's turn dresden into a peaceful and open city , a bastion against intolerance and stupidity .
we will confront nazis young and old who are trying to exploit this day of mourning , " orosz said . critics of the world war ii bombing raid claim it was unnecessary because germany was already close to defeat .
the city has only been restored to its pre-war glory in the last 10 years . a series of concerts and memorial services were arranged for the evening , including one at the frauenkirche , or church of our lady , which has been rebuilt .
failed attempt to ban the march the right-wing march was organized by a group known as the junge landsmannschaft ostdeutschland -lrb- young national association of east germany -rrb- , or jlo , which is supported by germany 's right-wing party , the npd .
german neo-nazis claim the carpet bombing of dresden at the end of world war ii was a war crime and have been holding rallies since the 1990s to protest what they call the " bombing holocaust . "
germany 's right-wing scene has been staging demonstrations in dresden on february 13 for over a decade .
the city of dresden had tried to have the march banned yet a saxony state court ruled against a ban , saying that would have breeched german constitutional laws allowing public assembly. rc / cmk / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
