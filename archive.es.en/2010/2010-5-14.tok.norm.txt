program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 ecumenical event in germany aims to instill trust in churches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are seeking orientation , says the co-president of event " the church is not only about abuse " is the message the ecumenical kirchentag , a meeting between germany 's churches , endeavors to relay .
re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 14.05.2010 global software piracy cost more than $ 50 billion in 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an amnesty campaign gives german business 30 days to register their software some 43 percent of computer programs used worldwide were illegal copies in 2009 , says the business software alliance .
losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .

while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .

greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .

the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 14.05.2010 global software piracy cost more than $ 50 billion in 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an amnesty campaign gives german business 30 days to register their software some 43 percent of computer programs used worldwide were illegal copies in 2009 , says the business software alliance .
losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 female hindu priests in india are making strides in a male-dominated profession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra lele works as a female hindu priest in pune for centuries , many hindu rituals have been performed by male priests .
but now a few institutions in pune have begun offering courses to female priests . hindu chants ring through pradnya patil 's new home .
it 's on the 11th floor of a luxury apartment building in pune .
in the sunny living room , statues of hindu gods are arranged on the floor .
a smell of incense fills the air .
a traditional house-warming ceremony is underway .
but pradnya patil has broken with tradition today - the 35-year-old has invited a woman priest to perform the ritual .
patil is convinced that women priests are better than their male counterparts .
" i recently attended a house-warming ceremony led by a male priest - it took five whole hours !
but women priests perform similar rituals in just one hour .
they explain the importance of the rituals and why they are still relevant .
they 're very sincere and committed .
now , my relatives and even my conservative father have switched to women priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mostly young , urban hindus are calling the female priests for ceremonies chitra lele sits on the floor in pradnya patil 's apartment and explains the ritual in the local language marathi .
she looks nothing like a traditional hindu priest in austere white robes .
instead , she wears a colorful silk sari and trendy rimless glasses .
the 41-year-old is married and has a teenage daughter .
she was drawn to the priesthood out of an interest in hinduism and sanskrit .
she performs all kinds of rituals : naming ceremonies , weddings as well as festivals .
she says female priests have struck a chord among young urban indians .
" we women priests explain the gist of the ritual in just one hour .
we try and involve the people watching .
so we 're popular among the young generation . "
priesthood courses women like chitra lele are challenging traditional notions of priesthood .
and they are learning to do that at pune 's dyanprabodhini center , which was started by a social reformer .
the school 's imposing stone building is located in the bustling old part of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hindu pujas are elaborate rituals that take hours more than 20 women are currently enrolled in the one-year priesthood course .
they come from all hindu castes .
most are housewives between 40 and 65 years of age .
they are trained in religious rituals and each of the 16 sacraments of hinduism .
and they ’ re taught sanskrit , the country 's classical language in which the hindu religious mantras are chanted - and which few indians understand .
" we have a great pleasure that women who are learning here are performing outside in society very confidently .
they are progressive but they still preserve our ancient traditions and culture also " , says aarya joshi , teacher of the course .
the 30-year-old explains that women priests largely perform religious ceremonies at private homes – not at temples .
and they do n't perform funerals or death rites either .
they are more widely accepted in big cities than in more conservative rural india .
joshi is a sanskrit researcher herself .
she 's working on her doctorate on hindu ancestral worship .
she points out that hinduism has never barred women from performing religious rites .
there 's even mention of them in ancient religious writings .
but later men came to dominate the profession .
they declared that priests could only be male and only from a particular hindu caste .
that thinking prevails till today .
" the problem occurs because i think that people do n't have an exact idea of women priesthood " , says joshi .
" they do n't know that this is an ancient tradition for the past 5,000 years .
it 's a typical orthodox mindset .
some 25 percent of the people are n't ready to accept women priesthood .
but we think it will change with the period of time , so we have to wait for that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in pune , female priests have become quite popular mixed reactions on the hot , busy street outside the school , people are divided about whether women should work as priests .
" i do n't think women should be conducting religious ceremonies .
our culture does n't allow it .
that 's how it 's always been , " says one man .
but another one is more open : " i do n't have a problem with women priests .
but i think it 's bad if they conduct religious ceremonies during menstruation .
it 's impure . "
a woman adds , " i think it 's good if women work as priests .
as a woman , you feel less scared talking to them than you do to male priests . "
male resistance back at the school , joshi says the main opposition to women priests usually comes from the male clergy .
" actually male priests , who are performing rituals in the traditional ways , have a great worry about their source of income because this is their bread and butter . "
anand pandharpure agrees .
he 's been working as a priest for the last 20 years , having been trained at an early age by his own father .
he says that to become a hindu priest , men have to undergo rigorous daily training at special religious schools for at least 7 to 8 years .
the 40-year-old is dismissive of what he calls " priesthood light " courses for women .
" you face many complex questions as a hindu priest " , says pandharpure .
" but women often ca n't answer them because they only get superficial training .
and i think people are being fooled when so-called women priests shorten religious rituals .
it 's more like entertainment .
it gives priesthood a bad name . "
pandharpure is dressed in the traditional clothes of a hindu priest – a white dhoti and a black peaked cap .
he rejects the idea that women priests pose a threat to him and his male colleagues .
" women often turn to priesthood after 40 , once their kids have grown up , and they have nothing to do .
but i do n't think that ’ s right .
priesthood is not just a hobby .
it 's an important responsibility .
for us men , being priests is a lifelong learning experience .
but frankly we do n't take the issue of women priests too seriously – their numbers are really negligible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a laptop puja : tradition and modernity tend to blend well in india hindu rituals in english they may not be taken seriously by some , but female priests are increasingly charting their own course in the male-dominated field .
manisha shete has been working as a priest for three years .
the cheerful 40-year-old has found a new target group for her services .
" nowadays i conduct a lot of marriages in english because indians who go abroad increasingly marry foreign partners .
but they 're keen on having an indian wedding .
and indian parents who live overseas often want their children to learn about their culture .
but the children do n't understand marathi .
so i conduct the thread ceremony – a rite of passage for boys - in english . "
the simplified rituals in english can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions .
" a father of one of the boys once came to me and said ' you know , my thread ceremony was done decades ago – but it 's only now that i understand why it was done and what it meant " ' , laughs manisha shete .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 ecumenical event in germany aims to instill trust in churches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are seeking orientation , says the co-president of event " the church is not only about abuse " is the message the ecumenical kirchentag , a meeting between germany 's churches , endeavors to relay .
re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

a research team , backed by greenpeace , has set off on a unique expedition to measure the likely impact of current rates of warming on the region . for climate scientists , the arctic is like the proverbial canary in the mineshaft .
because it 's so sensitive to change , it serves as an alarm for global trends . on friday -lrb- 14.05.2010 -rrb- , a team of scientists is setting off from kiel , germany , on board the greenpeace ship esperanza to measure just how dramatically the region could be affected by current warming scenarios . the greenpeace " arctic under pressure expedition " aims to carry out unique experiments , which are to be among the first to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- levels on arctic marine life . getting close to nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant containers will capture arctic water samples the arctic 's ice cover reflects a significant portion of planet-warming sunlight back into space .
as ocean water does the exact opposite , losing arctic ice can have a self-reinforcing effect . as well as absorbing sunlight , the world 's oceans also suck up carbon dioxide .
with co2 levels rising in the atmosphere , oceans are taking on ever-greater amounts and becoming more acidic in the process . rising temperatures and rising acidity pose a dual threat to marine organisms that are unaccustomed to the abrupt changes taking place in their habitat .
sensitive creatures like plankton and corals are among the most critically threatened . this is already well known , but the idea of the greenpeace expedition is to simulate arctic conditions as true to nature as possible . " the idea is to have an experiment in situ , " said ulf riebesell , head of acidification research at the university of kiel . " we do n't want to take the organisms into the lab .
we want to study them where they occur .
and we do n't want to study individual organisms .
we want to study the entire ecosystem with all its components , " he said . riebesell will be joining the international team of scientists off the norwegian arctic island of spitsbergen in five weeks time for what he says is one of the first attempts to project the impact of rising co2 levels on-site in a region that is " particularly sensitive to acidification . " big beaker tubes called mesocosms , taller than a double-decker bus , will be lowered 17 meters into the ocean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corals are among the most sensitive marine species when it comes to changes in habitat there , nine of these tubes will collect 50,000 litres of water each .
the mecocosms will be exposed to different treatments , designed to reflect levels of co2 and warming over the coming decades , to see how the region might be expected to hold up . the team of researchers from germany , the uk , and the us will also examine glacier-melting in greenland and the effects of industrial fishing in previously inaccessible regions during the four-month expedition . but the goal is more than just realizing scientific data . despite the mounting evidence of climate change , polls suggest that public support for action to tackle the problem has waned in recent months .
so esperanza 's mission to the arctic also hopes to add to pressure on politicians to take urgent action . " unfortunately , in copenhagen we could n't see the politicians follow science , especially on -lrb- the -rrb- emissions reduction issue , " said martin kaiser , greenpeace climate politics coordinator . the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports that provide the scientific basis for negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take years to compile , and often lack the most recent data .
because of this , the reports tend to be conservative in nature and have consistently underestimated the urgency of the problem so far . new climate related studies almost invariably reveal a problem unfolding faster than we had previously expected , which is why greenpeace wants to see decision-makers getting the most up to date information available . " this is the kind of information that we need to have -lrb- to get -rrb- the full picture on the impacts of global warming , " kaiser said . it 's estimated that global emissions will need to fall by 40 % on 1990 levels within the decade if the arctic is to have any chance of being preserved in the condition it 's been in for the past 10,000 years . author : chiponda chimbelu editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one person was killed and nearly a dozen people were wounded .
the violence comes as the thai troops attempt to seal off the encampment of the protestors in the city centre in bangkok . thai troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas towards protestors , as they moved in on friday to seal the encampment of the red shirts in the centre of bangkok . a loud blast and gunshots were also heard , though it is unclear if the troops were using live rounds .
protestors set off fireworks on security forces in response .
foreign embassies in the area were closed amid violence .
a thai photographer and a bangkok based-foreign journalist were wounded . there have been reports that some protestors set fire into an empty police bus and vandalised army vehicles and water canons near lumpini park , near downtown bangkok . the red shirts had formed their own checkpoint overnight at the famous suan lam night market to stop soldiers from sealing roads leading to the ratchaprasong site , a key intersection in the city where protesters have set up camp .
according to afp news agency , at least three red shirts were seen being detained by the security forces .

he has been accused of trying to jeopardise the government 's moves to reconcile with the protestors .
he was shot in the head on thursday .
his condition remains critical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators are arrested by thai soldiers in downtown bangkok reconciliation deal collapsed the protesters have been occupying parts of bangkok for more than two months .
they want prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections .
they consider the present government illegitimate because it came to power in a parliamentary vote in 2008 after a court ousted elected allies of former premier thaksin shinawatra , whom the red shirts support .
thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 .
he lives in a self-imposed exile ever since . premier abhisit offered earlier this month to hold polls in november .
the red shirts had initially welcomed the move .
but they refused to disperse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 14.05.2010 strolling down the berlin boulevard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boulevard theater is an outdated format where theater is pure entertainment .
but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .
ben knight is playing jay , a rejected auditionee in " ladies night " at the komoedie am kurfuerstendamm from may 16 to june 13 .

but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 14.05.2010 turkey and greece take concrete steps towards better relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan arrived in athens with 10 cabinet ministers greece 's and turkey 's historical differences have brought them to the brink of war on several occasions , but now leaders from the two nations are trying to bury the hatchet . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been meeting with greek leaders in athens to discuss efforts to ease bilateral tensions .
" i am confident that the novel and courageous step we are attempting today can pay off because the will is there , " greek prime minister george papandreou said at a joint news conference held with erdogan .
erdogan is the first turkish prime minister to make an official visit to greece since 2004 .
the leaders used their meeting to establish a new greek-turkish high cooperation council , under which the two are to meet annually .
immigration agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has blamed turkey for failing to stop illegal immigrants from reaching greek islands the turkish prime minister later signed a bilateral agreement with his greek counterpart , george papandreou , pledging to accept at least 1,000 requests to repatriate illegal turkish immigrants living in greece . it was one of over 20 bilateral agreements that the two sides signed on friday , on topics ranging from tourism to energy .
regional foes for centuries , greece and turkey have been on the brink of war as recently as 1996 .
their relationship has improved over the last decade , though animosity still runs high over the status of cyprus and the sovereignty of the aegean sea .
cutting defense spending in greece , the perceived threat from fellow nato-member turkey has fueled high levels of military spending .
erdogan told greek public television on thursday that he hoped that the bilateral talks would result in the two countries being able to reduce military spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the only country that recognizes the government of the self-declared turkish cypriot state " both countries have huge defense budgets and they will achieve a lot of savings in this way , " he said .
greece 's defense expenditure is the highest as a proportion of gross domestic product of any country in the european union , a fact that could hardly be ignored as the country was forced to accept an eu-international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- bailout to combat its staggering debt load . turkey , too , was forced to seek financial help from the imf in 1991 in order to restructure its economy after a financial crisis , an experience could provide common ground for talks with greece. smh / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

one person was killed and nearly a dozen people were wounded .
the violence comes as the thai troops attempt to seal off the encampment of the protestors in the city centre in bangkok . thai troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas towards protestors , as they moved in on friday to seal the encampment of the red shirts in the centre of bangkok . a loud blast and gunshots were also heard , though it is unclear if the troops were using live rounds .
protestors set off fireworks on security forces in response .
foreign embassies in the area were closed amid violence .
a thai photographer and a bangkok based-foreign journalist were wounded . there have been reports that some protestors set fire into an empty police bus and vandalised army vehicles and water canons near lumpini park , near downtown bangkok . the red shirts had formed their own checkpoint overnight at the famous suan lam night market to stop soldiers from sealing roads leading to the ratchaprasong site , a key intersection in the city where protesters have set up camp .
according to afp news agency , at least three red shirts were seen being detained by the security forces .

he has been accused of trying to jeopardise the government 's moves to reconcile with the protestors .
he was shot in the head on thursday .

thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 .
he lives in a self-imposed exile ever since . premier abhisit offered earlier this month to hold polls in november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 female hindu priests in india are making strides in a male-dominated profession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra lele works as a female hindu priest in pune for centuries , many hindu rituals have been performed by male priests .
but now a few institutions in pune have begun offering courses to female priests . hindu chants ring through pradnya patil 's new home .
it 's on the 11th floor of a luxury apartment building in pune .
in the sunny living room , statues of hindu gods are arranged on the floor .
a smell of incense fills the air .
a traditional house-warming ceremony is underway .
but pradnya patil has broken with tradition today - the 35-year-old has invited a woman priest to perform the ritual .
patil is convinced that women priests are better than their male counterparts .
" i recently attended a house-warming ceremony led by a male priest - it took five whole hours !
but women priests perform similar rituals in just one hour .
they explain the importance of the rituals and why they are still relevant .
they 're very sincere and committed .
now , my relatives and even my conservative father have switched to women priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mostly young , urban hindus are calling the female priests for ceremonies chitra lele sits on the floor in pradnya patil 's apartment and explains the ritual in the local language marathi .
she looks nothing like a traditional hindu priest in austere white robes .
instead , she wears a colorful silk sari and trendy rimless glasses .
the 41-year-old is married and has a teenage daughter .
she was drawn to the priesthood out of an interest in hinduism and sanskrit .
she performs all kinds of rituals : naming ceremonies , weddings as well as festivals .
she says female priests have struck a chord among young urban indians .
" we women priests explain the gist of the ritual in just one hour .
we try and involve the people watching .
so we 're popular among the young generation . "
priesthood courses women like chitra lele are challenging traditional notions of priesthood .
and they are learning to do that at pune 's dyanprabodhini center , which was started by a social reformer .
the school 's imposing stone building is located in the bustling old part of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hindu pujas are elaborate rituals that take hours more than 20 women are currently enrolled in the one-year priesthood course .
they come from all hindu castes .
most are housewives between 40 and 65 years of age .
they are trained in religious rituals and each of the 16 sacraments of hinduism .
and they ’ re taught sanskrit , the country 's classical language in which the hindu religious mantras are chanted - and which few indians understand .
" we have a great pleasure that women who are learning here are performing outside in society very confidently .
they are progressive but they still preserve our ancient traditions and culture also " , says aarya joshi , teacher of the course .
the 30-year-old explains that women priests largely perform religious ceremonies at private homes – not at temples .
and they do n't perform funerals or death rites either .
they are more widely accepted in big cities than in more conservative rural india .
joshi is a sanskrit researcher herself .
she 's working on her doctorate on hindu ancestral worship .
she points out that hinduism has never barred women from performing religious rites .
there 's even mention of them in ancient religious writings .
but later men came to dominate the profession .
they declared that priests could only be male and only from a particular hindu caste .
that thinking prevails till today .
" the problem occurs because i think that people do n't have an exact idea of women priesthood " , says joshi .
" they do n't know that this is an ancient tradition for the past 5,000 years .
it 's a typical orthodox mindset .
some 25 percent of the people are n't ready to accept women priesthood .
but we think it will change with the period of time , so we have to wait for that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in pune , female priests have become quite popular mixed reactions on the hot , busy street outside the school , people are divided about whether women should work as priests .
" i do n't think women should be conducting religious ceremonies .
our culture does n't allow it .
that 's how it 's always been , " says one man .
but another one is more open : " i do n't have a problem with women priests .
but i think it 's bad if they conduct religious ceremonies during menstruation .
it 's impure . "
a woman adds , " i think it 's good if women work as priests .
as a woman , you feel less scared talking to them than you do to male priests . "
male resistance back at the school , joshi says the main opposition to women priests usually comes from the male clergy .
" actually male priests , who are performing rituals in the traditional ways , have a great worry about their source of income because this is their bread and butter . "
anand pandharpure agrees .
he 's been working as a priest for the last 20 years , having been trained at an early age by his own father .
he says that to become a hindu priest , men have to undergo rigorous daily training at special religious schools for at least 7 to 8 years .
the 40-year-old is dismissive of what he calls " priesthood light " courses for women .
" you face many complex questions as a hindu priest " , says pandharpure .
" but women often ca n't answer them because they only get superficial training .
and i think people are being fooled when so-called women priests shorten religious rituals .
it 's more like entertainment .
it gives priesthood a bad name . "
pandharpure is dressed in the traditional clothes of a hindu priest – a white dhoti and a black peaked cap .
he rejects the idea that women priests pose a threat to him and his male colleagues .
" women often turn to priesthood after 40 , once their kids have grown up , and they have nothing to do .
but i do n't think that ’ s right .
priesthood is not just a hobby .
it 's an important responsibility .
for us men , being priests is a lifelong learning experience .
but frankly we do n't take the issue of women priests too seriously – their numbers are really negligible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a laptop puja : tradition and modernity tend to blend well in india hindu rituals in english they may not be taken seriously by some , but female priests are increasingly charting their own course in the male-dominated field .
manisha shete has been working as a priest for three years .
the cheerful 40-year-old has found a new target group for her services .
" nowadays i conduct a lot of marriages in english because indians who go abroad increasingly marry foreign partners .
but they 're keen on having an indian wedding .
and indian parents who live overseas often want their children to learn about their culture .
but the children do n't understand marathi .
so i conduct the thread ceremony – a rite of passage for boys - in english . "
the simplified rituals in english can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions .
" a father of one of the boys once came to me and said ' you know , my thread ceremony was done decades ago – but it 's only now that i understand why it was done and what it meant " ' , laughs manisha shete .

" of course sanctions against iran play a big role .
but those who do business with the chinese know the saying : the chinese never say no to anyone .
chinese companies have won many jobs in various sectors in iran in the past years . "
the iranian market is flooded with ' cheap products ' from china - from textiles and toys to dvd players and the latest models of mobile phones .
experts in iran have cautioned against the chinese competition , saying it jeopardizes iran 's industry and job market .
but it has been in vain , says laghaie : " we still do n't have strict laws governing the volume and quality of imports from china .
the majority of iranians can not afford to buy expensive , high-quality products .
on the other hand , the chinese authorities do not have the capacities to control everything that is produced in and exported from such a large country .
so everyone just does what they want . "

the oppositional journalist mehdi mohseni is surprised .
" nobody knows about oil deals with china in iran .
outside of iran is where i heard about it and i was really shocked .
china is only known to us in our country because of its cheap products . "
aside from cheap products , people in iran hardly know anything about china , although both cultures have been linked by the silk road for centuries .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .

that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 14.05.2010 child care , education become focus of germany 's budgetary debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daycare centers could remain scarce after 2013 chancellor merkel has ruled out balancing the budget through cuts in spending on education .
but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .

" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 14.05.2010 global software piracy cost more than $ 50 billion in 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an amnesty campaign gives german business 30 days to register their software some 43 percent of computer programs used worldwide were illegal copies in 2009 , says the business software alliance .
losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 ecumenical event in germany aims to instill trust in churches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are seeking orientation , says the co-president of event " the church is not only about abuse " is the message the ecumenical kirchentag , a meeting between germany 's churches , endeavors to relay .
re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.05.2010 ackermann interview sparks debate on greek rescue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo ackermann says greece is unlikely to pay its debt deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann told german public television that he doubted greece could pay off its debt .
this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .

but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .

rounding out the field of nine potential hosts to host either the 2018 or the 2022 edition of the world cup were three additional delegations from europe , four from asia and the united states .
russia joined england as solo-country hosts , while the netherlands have teamed up with belgium and spain has paired with portugal in joint bids .
australia , japan , qatar , and south korea rounded out the list of bidding countries .
with the world 's biggest sporting event coming to the african continent for the first time this summer in south africa , and a long-awaited return to south america four years later in brazil , observers say a return to europe in 2018 is likely , followed by asia in 2022 .
japan , qatar , and south korea have specifically submitted their bids for the 2022 edition only .
the last european world cup was the 2006 edition in germany , and it was preceded by a co-hosted tournament by japan and south korea in 2002 .

a research team , backed by greenpeace , has set off on a unique expedition to measure the likely impact of current rates of warming on the region . for climate scientists , the arctic is like the proverbial canary in the mineshaft .
because it 's so sensitive to change , it serves as an alarm for global trends . on friday -lrb- 14.05.2010 -rrb- , a team of scientists is setting off from kiel , germany , on board the greenpeace ship esperanza to measure just how dramatically the region could be affected by current warming scenarios . the greenpeace " arctic under pressure expedition " aims to carry out unique experiments , which are to be among the first to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- levels on arctic marine life . getting close to nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant containers will capture arctic water samples the arctic 's ice cover reflects a significant portion of planet-warming sunlight back into space .
as ocean water does the exact opposite , losing arctic ice can have a self-reinforcing effect . as well as absorbing sunlight , the world 's oceans also suck up carbon dioxide .
with co2 levels rising in the atmosphere , oceans are taking on ever-greater amounts and becoming more acidic in the process . rising temperatures and rising acidity pose a dual threat to marine organisms that are unaccustomed to the abrupt changes taking place in their habitat .
sensitive creatures like plankton and corals are among the most critically threatened . this is already well known , but the idea of the greenpeace expedition is to simulate arctic conditions as true to nature as possible . " the idea is to have an experiment in situ , " said ulf riebesell , head of acidification research at the university of kiel . " we do n't want to take the organisms into the lab .
we want to study them where they occur .
and we do n't want to study individual organisms .
we want to study the entire ecosystem with all its components , " he said . riebesell will be joining the international team of scientists off the norwegian arctic island of spitsbergen in five weeks time for what he says is one of the first attempts to project the impact of rising co2 levels on-site in a region that is " particularly sensitive to acidification . " big beaker tubes called mesocosms , taller than a double-decker bus , will be lowered 17 meters into the ocean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corals are among the most sensitive marine species when it comes to changes in habitat there , nine of these tubes will collect 50,000 litres of water each .

so esperanza 's mission to the arctic also hopes to add to pressure on politicians to take urgent action . " unfortunately , in copenhagen we could n't see the politicians follow science , especially on -lrb- the -rrb- emissions reduction issue , " said martin kaiser , greenpeace climate politics coordinator . the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports that provide the scientific basis for negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take years to compile , and often lack the most recent data .
because of this , the reports tend to be conservative in nature and have consistently underestimated the urgency of the problem so far . new climate related studies almost invariably reveal a problem unfolding faster than we had previously expected , which is why greenpeace wants to see decision-makers getting the most up to date information available . " this is the kind of information that we need to have -lrb- to get -rrb- the full picture on the impacts of global warming , " kaiser said . it 's estimated that global emissions will need to fall by 40 % on 1990 levels within the decade if the arctic is to have any chance of being preserved in the condition it 's been in for the past 10,000 years . author : chiponda chimbelu editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .

chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

but it has been in vain , says laghaie : " we still do n't have strict laws governing the volume and quality of imports from china .
the majority of iranians can not afford to buy expensive , high-quality products .
on the other hand , the chinese authorities do not have the capacities to control everything that is produced in and exported from such a large country .
so everyone just does what they want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of phase five of the south pars gas field in the southern port of assaluyeh , iran oil deals with china are kept secret the iranian economy is mostly centralized and is almost completely state-controlled .
in the iranian economy , corruption is a wide-spread problem .
in its latest corruption index , transparency international has ranked iran 168 of 180 countries .
this year , china became iran 's number one trade partner .
china exports mainly weapons to the isolated country in return for oil and gas .
the oppositional journalist mehdi mohseni is surprised .
" nobody knows about oil deals with china in iran .
outside of iran is where i heard about it and i was really shocked .
china is only known to us in our country because of its cheap products . "
aside from cheap products , people in iran hardly know anything about china , although both cultures have been linked by the silk road for centuries .
iranians do n't hear about things like the tiananmen massacre nor about the brutal crackdown of chinese security forces on demonstrators in tibet and xinjiang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese and iranian officials hold talks iranian lawyer , human rights defender and nobel peace prize winner , shirin ebadi , criticizes the country 's blindness .
" the chinese government exploits the rights of its people to a great extent - just like the iranian government .
whenever a moslem is killed in the middle east , the iranian government makes a huge deal out of it .
but when thousands of muslim uighurs are killed in china , they say nothing .
and they make sure the press says nothing . "
shirin ebadi has observed how the iranian people are starting to see through the government despite censored media coverage .
she says now , when the state marches on the streets shouting " down with america and down with israel " , the people shout instead , " down with russia " and " down with china . "

as a permanent member of the un security council , beijing is calling for a diplomatic approach towards iran 's nuclear program and for a stop to the sanctions . iran is the second largest supplier of oil to the people 's republic of china and within the first nine months of 2009 , it became largest market for the investment of chinese companies in construction and projects . fariborz laghaie likes to trade with the chinese .

he says china 's influence on the iranian market is growing by the day .
" of course sanctions against iran play a big role .
but those who do business with the chinese know the saying : the chinese never say no to anyone .
chinese companies have won many jobs in various sectors in iran in the past years . "
the iranian market is flooded with ' cheap products ' from china - from textiles and toys to dvd players and the latest models of mobile phones .
experts in iran have cautioned against the chinese competition , saying it jeopardizes iran 's industry and job market .
but it has been in vain , says laghaie : " we still do n't have strict laws governing the volume and quality of imports from china .
the majority of iranians can not afford to buy expensive , high-quality products .
on the other hand , the chinese authorities do not have the capacities to control everything that is produced in and exported from such a large country .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .

deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .

several other european potentials hosts submitted bids , as did four asian nations and the us . david beckham may have been second in the alphabetized running order of nations submitting bids to host the 2018 or 2022 world cup at a ceremony at fifa headquarters in zurich , but he was certainly the biggest celebrity to throw his star power behind his country 's bid .
the english soccer star officially put england 's name in the hat by handing over a detailed ' bid book ' of england proposal as a host nation to fifa head sepp blatter .
" we have a lot of passion for the game and passion for bringing the biggest sporting event to the country , " said beckham , who was flanked by officials from england 's football association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the dutch delegation were all on two wheels " this is something that runs throughout our country , our veins , it 's something that we were brought up with , " he added .
david cameron , just days into his job as great britain 's newest prime minister , also lent his support to england 's cause in a phone call to blatter on thursday .
europe due for a world cup ?
rounding out the field of nine potential hosts to host either the 2018 or the 2022 edition of the world cup were three additional delegations from europe , four from asia and the united states .
russia joined england as solo-country hosts , while the netherlands have teamed up with belgium and spain has paired with portugal in joint bids .
australia , japan , qatar , and south korea rounded out the list of bidding countries .
with the world 's biggest sporting event coming to the african continent for the first time this summer in south africa , and a long-awaited return to south america four years later in brazil , observers say a return to europe in 2018 is likely , followed by asia in 2022 .
japan , qatar , and south korea have specifically submitted their bids for the 2022 edition only .
the last european world cup was the 2006 edition in germany , and it was preceded by a co-hosted tournament by japan and south korea in 2002 .
creative bids while england hoped to use beckham 's celebrity status to its advantage as the complex round of lobbying for the world cup begins , other nations opted for different tactics to draw attention to their bids .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's bid featured origami and a pda device ruud gullit , a former dutch player and current coach , rode a bicycle to the fifa headquarters with his delegation in support of an environmentally friendly tournament hosted by the netherlands and belgium .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

turkey 's eu ambitions and greece 's economic woes could be catalysts for improved relations . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has arrived in athens for talks on friday with perhaps the highest profile entourage he could muster .
turkey 's cabinet ministers for the economy , foreign trade , the interior , foreign affairs , transport , energy , education , tourism , the environment and european affairs are all part of the delegation , not to mention around 100 business leaders . greece 's and turkey 's historical differences have brought them to the brink of war on several occasions , and the two countries are looking for ways to normalize their ties .
the visit is being hailed as historic in turkey .
while that may not yet be true , many analysts believe that now is the perfect time for the neighbors to put their past behind them . " it 's definitely a perfect win-win situation , " political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university in turkey told deutsche welle .
" if these two countries can solve their joint problems once and for all , it will be fantastic for both . " greece and turkey still dispute the territorial waters of the aegean sea , and their air forces still fight mock dog-fights on a regular basis .
both countries have sizeable military budgets , primarily because of these bilateral tensions . " neither the people of greece nor turkey need new submarines or fighter jets , " said turkey 's eu affairs minister , egemen bagis , noting how strange it was that two nato members should spend billions to counter a perceived threat from each other .
this military spending has come under particularly sharp focus in greece as the country battles fiscal insolvency and a bloated public sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and turkey spend a fortune preparing to fight each other greece 's defense expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is the highest in the eu . " in order for our people to enjoy the benefits of arms-spending reductions , we must first erase the threats and create necessary trust , " said greek foreign ministry spokesman , gregory delavekouras . the cyprus question the divided island of cyprus will also be an unavoidable issue during the talks .
cyprus was split between primarily greek and turkish communities in 1974 , when turkey invaded the northern segment of the island after a coup backed by athens changed the political landscape there . the greek part of cyprus is an eu member , which has vetoed several of turkey 's eu accession chapters .
ankara is keen to join the european union , but without some kind of settlement in cyprus , this seems unlikely . " we want a resolution to the cyprus problem , " said a foreign affairs committee spokesman for the turkish parliament .
" we want to integrate further with the european union , and cyprus is a problem . " un-sponsored talks aimed at reaching a settlement for the island are underway , but in april , turkish cypriots elected a new hard-line leader who is critical of the process . insiders in ankara say prime minister erdogan will push his greek counterpart , george papandreou , to agree to expanding the un cyprus talks , including greece and turkey more directly in the negotiations . " i do fear , if these talks fail now , that we may be looking at a partition on the island of cyprus for another generation , or longer , " richard howitt , a member of the european parliament 's committee on turkey , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : without athens ' support , turkey might never get into the eu money talks if ankara has strong political motivations for resolving the cyprus issue and improving ties with greece , then athens has a host of economic reasons to seek a less frosty relationship with turkey . the roughly 100 business leaders accompanying the turkish delegation should also send a clear message to greece that political stability can have a positive economic impact , as well as reducing military costs . athens is desperately trying to reduce its runaway budget deficit and national debt , and has had to call on its eurozone partners and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to step in and help it meet its loan repayments . turkey endured similar debt problems a decade ago , soliciting financial aid from the imf , and the country has offered to share its expertise on this situation with the greek government . " there 's a lot of empathy in turkey for greece right now , " a turkish columnist for a liberal daily newspaper wrote this week .
" we know a lot about the imf , belt-tightening , union unrest , all those things .
we 've been down that road . " even though previous attempts by greek and turkish leaders to resolve their differences have failed , many analysts observe that both countries now appear to have sufficient desire to improve ties and that some kind of first step is possible . turkish political scientist cengiz aktar thinks that a comprehensive non-aggression pact could be a plausible development from the two-day visit . " i think that might have a tremendous , positive effect , especially in terms of peace dividends .
it would help the greek economy 's present and future problems . " author : dorian jones -lrb- msh -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a research team , backed by greenpeace , has set off on a unique expedition to measure the likely impact of current rates of warming on the region . for climate scientists , the arctic is like the proverbial canary in the mineshaft .
because it 's so sensitive to change , it serves as an alarm for global trends . on friday -lrb- 14.05.2010 -rrb- , a team of scientists is setting off from kiel , germany , on board the greenpeace ship esperanza to measure just how dramatically the region could be affected by current warming scenarios . the greenpeace " arctic under pressure expedition " aims to carry out unique experiments , which are to be among the first to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- levels on arctic marine life . getting close to nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant containers will capture arctic water samples the arctic 's ice cover reflects a significant portion of planet-warming sunlight back into space .
as ocean water does the exact opposite , losing arctic ice can have a self-reinforcing effect . as well as absorbing sunlight , the world 's oceans also suck up carbon dioxide .
with co2 levels rising in the atmosphere , oceans are taking on ever-greater amounts and becoming more acidic in the process . rising temperatures and rising acidity pose a dual threat to marine organisms that are unaccustomed to the abrupt changes taking place in their habitat .
sensitive creatures like plankton and corals are among the most critically threatened . this is already well known , but the idea of the greenpeace expedition is to simulate arctic conditions as true to nature as possible . " the idea is to have an experiment in situ , " said ulf riebesell , head of acidification research at the university of kiel . " we do n't want to take the organisms into the lab .
we want to study them where they occur .
and we do n't want to study individual organisms .
we want to study the entire ecosystem with all its components , " he said . riebesell will be joining the international team of scientists off the norwegian arctic island of spitsbergen in five weeks time for what he says is one of the first attempts to project the impact of rising co2 levels on-site in a region that is " particularly sensitive to acidification . " big beaker tubes called mesocosms , taller than a double-decker bus , will be lowered 17 meters into the ocean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corals are among the most sensitive marine species when it comes to changes in habitat there , nine of these tubes will collect 50,000 litres of water each .
the mecocosms will be exposed to different treatments , designed to reflect levels of co2 and warming over the coming decades , to see how the region might be expected to hold up . the team of researchers from germany , the uk , and the us will also examine glacier-melting in greenland and the effects of industrial fishing in previously inaccessible regions during the four-month expedition . but the goal is more than just realizing scientific data . despite the mounting evidence of climate change , polls suggest that public support for action to tackle the problem has waned in recent months .
so esperanza 's mission to the arctic also hopes to add to pressure on politicians to take urgent action . " unfortunately , in copenhagen we could n't see the politicians follow science , especially on -lrb- the -rrb- emissions reduction issue , " said martin kaiser , greenpeace climate politics coordinator . the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports that provide the scientific basis for negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take years to compile , and often lack the most recent data .
because of this , the reports tend to be conservative in nature and have consistently underestimated the urgency of the problem so far . new climate related studies almost invariably reveal a problem unfolding faster than we had previously expected , which is why greenpeace wants to see decision-makers getting the most up to date information available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 14.05.2010 strolling down the berlin boulevard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boulevard theater is an outdated format where theater is pure entertainment .
but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .
ben knight is playing jay , a rejected auditionee in " ladies night " at the komoedie am kurfuerstendamm from may 16 to june 13 .

but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .
ben knight is playing jay , a rejected auditionee in " ladies night " at the komoedie am kurfuerstendamm from may 16 to june 13 .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

several other european potentials hosts submitted bids , as did four asian nations and the us . david beckham may have been second in the alphabetized running order of nations submitting bids to host the 2018 or 2022 world cup at a ceremony at fifa headquarters in zurich , but he was certainly the biggest celebrity to throw his star power behind his country 's bid .
the english soccer star officially put england 's name in the hat by handing over a detailed ' bid book ' of england proposal as a host nation to fifa head sepp blatter .
" we have a lot of passion for the game and passion for bringing the biggest sporting event to the country , " said beckham , who was flanked by officials from england 's football association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the dutch delegation were all on two wheels " this is something that runs throughout our country , our veins , it 's something that we were brought up with , " he added .
david cameron , just days into his job as great britain 's newest prime minister , also lent his support to england 's cause in a phone call to blatter on thursday .
europe due for a world cup ?
rounding out the field of nine potential hosts to host either the 2018 or the 2022 edition of the world cup were three additional delegations from europe , four from asia and the united states .
russia joined england as solo-country hosts , while the netherlands have teamed up with belgium and spain has paired with portugal in joint bids .
australia , japan , qatar , and south korea rounded out the list of bidding countries .
with the world 's biggest sporting event coming to the african continent for the first time this summer in south africa , and a long-awaited return to south america four years later in brazil , observers say a return to europe in 2018 is likely , followed by asia in 2022 .
japan , qatar , and south korea have specifically submitted their bids for the 2022 edition only .
the last european world cup was the 2006 edition in germany , and it was preceded by a co-hosted tournament by japan and south korea in 2002 .
creative bids while england hoped to use beckham 's celebrity status to its advantage as the complex round of lobbying for the world cup begins , other nations opted for different tactics to draw attention to their bids .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's bid featured origami and a pda device ruud gullit , a former dutch player and current coach , rode a bicycle to the fifa headquarters with his delegation in support of an environmentally friendly tournament hosted by the netherlands and belgium .
" we try to give two million bikes to all the fans , so they can go everywhere , " gullit said .
japan 's bid book contained pop out origami sculpture on top of a pda device with the bid details saved on it .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 female hindu priests in india are making strides in a male-dominated profession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra lele works as a female hindu priest in pune for centuries , many hindu rituals have been performed by male priests .
but now a few institutions in pune have begun offering courses to female priests . hindu chants ring through pradnya patil 's new home .
it 's on the 11th floor of a luxury apartment building in pune .
in the sunny living room , statues of hindu gods are arranged on the floor .
a smell of incense fills the air .
a traditional house-warming ceremony is underway .
but pradnya patil has broken with tradition today - the 35-year-old has invited a woman priest to perform the ritual .
patil is convinced that women priests are better than their male counterparts .
" i recently attended a house-warming ceremony led by a male priest - it took five whole hours !
but women priests perform similar rituals in just one hour .
they explain the importance of the rituals and why they are still relevant .
they 're very sincere and committed .
now , my relatives and even my conservative father have switched to women priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mostly young , urban hindus are calling the female priests for ceremonies chitra lele sits on the floor in pradnya patil 's apartment and explains the ritual in the local language marathi .
she looks nothing like a traditional hindu priest in austere white robes .
instead , she wears a colorful silk sari and trendy rimless glasses .
the 41-year-old is married and has a teenage daughter .
she was drawn to the priesthood out of an interest in hinduism and sanskrit .
she performs all kinds of rituals : naming ceremonies , weddings as well as festivals .
she says female priests have struck a chord among young urban indians .
" we women priests explain the gist of the ritual in just one hour .
we try and involve the people watching .
so we 're popular among the young generation . "
priesthood courses women like chitra lele are challenging traditional notions of priesthood .
and they are learning to do that at pune 's dyanprabodhini center , which was started by a social reformer .
the school 's imposing stone building is located in the bustling old part of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hindu pujas are elaborate rituals that take hours more than 20 women are currently enrolled in the one-year priesthood course .
they come from all hindu castes .
most are housewives between 40 and 65 years of age .
they are trained in religious rituals and each of the 16 sacraments of hinduism .
and they ’ re taught sanskrit , the country 's classical language in which the hindu religious mantras are chanted - and which few indians understand .
" we have a great pleasure that women who are learning here are performing outside in society very confidently .
they are progressive but they still preserve our ancient traditions and culture also " , says aarya joshi , teacher of the course .
the 30-year-old explains that women priests largely perform religious ceremonies at private homes – not at temples .
and they do n't perform funerals or death rites either .
they are more widely accepted in big cities than in more conservative rural india .
joshi is a sanskrit researcher herself .
she 's working on her doctorate on hindu ancestral worship .
she points out that hinduism has never barred women from performing religious rites .
there 's even mention of them in ancient religious writings .
but later men came to dominate the profession .
they declared that priests could only be male and only from a particular hindu caste .
that thinking prevails till today .
" the problem occurs because i think that people do n't have an exact idea of women priesthood " , says joshi .
" they do n't know that this is an ancient tradition for the past 5,000 years .
it 's a typical orthodox mindset .
some 25 percent of the people are n't ready to accept women priesthood .
but we think it will change with the period of time , so we have to wait for that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in pune , female priests have become quite popular mixed reactions on the hot , busy street outside the school , people are divided about whether women should work as priests .
" i do n't think women should be conducting religious ceremonies .
our culture does n't allow it .
that 's how it 's always been , " says one man .
but another one is more open : " i do n't have a problem with women priests .
but i think it 's bad if they conduct religious ceremonies during menstruation .
it 's impure . "
a woman adds , " i think it 's good if women work as priests .
as a woman , you feel less scared talking to them than you do to male priests . "
male resistance back at the school , joshi says the main opposition to women priests usually comes from the male clergy .
" actually male priests , who are performing rituals in the traditional ways , have a great worry about their source of income because this is their bread and butter . "
anand pandharpure agrees .
he 's been working as a priest for the last 20 years , having been trained at an early age by his own father .
he says that to become a hindu priest , men have to undergo rigorous daily training at special religious schools for at least 7 to 8 years .
the 40-year-old is dismissive of what he calls " priesthood light " courses for women .
" you face many complex questions as a hindu priest " , says pandharpure .
" but women often ca n't answer them because they only get superficial training .
and i think people are being fooled when so-called women priests shorten religious rituals .
it 's more like entertainment .
it gives priesthood a bad name . "
pandharpure is dressed in the traditional clothes of a hindu priest – a white dhoti and a black peaked cap .
he rejects the idea that women priests pose a threat to him and his male colleagues .
" women often turn to priesthood after 40 , once their kids have grown up , and they have nothing to do .
but i do n't think that ’ s right .
priesthood is not just a hobby .
it 's an important responsibility .
for us men , being priests is a lifelong learning experience .
but frankly we do n't take the issue of women priests too seriously – their numbers are really negligible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a laptop puja : tradition and modernity tend to blend well in india hindu rituals in english they may not be taken seriously by some , but female priests are increasingly charting their own course in the male-dominated field .
manisha shete has been working as a priest for three years .
the cheerful 40-year-old has found a new target group for her services .
" nowadays i conduct a lot of marriages in english because indians who go abroad increasingly marry foreign partners .
but they 're keen on having an indian wedding .
and indian parents who live overseas often want their children to learn about their culture .
but the children do n't understand marathi .
so i conduct the thread ceremony – a rite of passage for boys - in english . "
the simplified rituals in english can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions .
" a father of one of the boys once came to me and said ' you know , my thread ceremony was done decades ago – but it 's only now that i understand why it was done and what it meant " ' , laughs manisha shete .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .

" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .

the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .

since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .

the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

a research team , backed by greenpeace , has set off on a unique expedition to measure the likely impact of current rates of warming on the region . for climate scientists , the arctic is like the proverbial canary in the mineshaft .
because it 's so sensitive to change , it serves as an alarm for global trends . on friday -lrb- 14.05.2010 -rrb- , a team of scientists is setting off from kiel , germany , on board the greenpeace ship esperanza to measure just how dramatically the region could be affected by current warming scenarios . the greenpeace " arctic under pressure expedition " aims to carry out unique experiments , which are to be among the first to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- levels on arctic marine life . getting close to nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant containers will capture arctic water samples the arctic 's ice cover reflects a significant portion of planet-warming sunlight back into space .
as ocean water does the exact opposite , losing arctic ice can have a self-reinforcing effect . as well as absorbing sunlight , the world 's oceans also suck up carbon dioxide .
with co2 levels rising in the atmosphere , oceans are taking on ever-greater amounts and becoming more acidic in the process . rising temperatures and rising acidity pose a dual threat to marine organisms that are unaccustomed to the abrupt changes taking place in their habitat .
sensitive creatures like plankton and corals are among the most critically threatened . this is already well known , but the idea of the greenpeace expedition is to simulate arctic conditions as true to nature as possible . " the idea is to have an experiment in situ , " said ulf riebesell , head of acidification research at the university of kiel . " we do n't want to take the organisms into the lab .
we want to study them where they occur .
and we do n't want to study individual organisms .
we want to study the entire ecosystem with all its components , " he said . riebesell will be joining the international team of scientists off the norwegian arctic island of spitsbergen in five weeks time for what he says is one of the first attempts to project the impact of rising co2 levels on-site in a region that is " particularly sensitive to acidification . " big beaker tubes called mesocosms , taller than a double-decker bus , will be lowered 17 meters into the ocean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corals are among the most sensitive marine species when it comes to changes in habitat there , nine of these tubes will collect 50,000 litres of water each .
the mecocosms will be exposed to different treatments , designed to reflect levels of co2 and warming over the coming decades , to see how the region might be expected to hold up . the team of researchers from germany , the uk , and the us will also examine glacier-melting in greenland and the effects of industrial fishing in previously inaccessible regions during the four-month expedition . but the goal is more than just realizing scientific data . despite the mounting evidence of climate change , polls suggest that public support for action to tackle the problem has waned in recent months .
so esperanza 's mission to the arctic also hopes to add to pressure on politicians to take urgent action . " unfortunately , in copenhagen we could n't see the politicians follow science , especially on -lrb- the -rrb- emissions reduction issue , " said martin kaiser , greenpeace climate politics coordinator . the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports that provide the scientific basis for negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take years to compile , and often lack the most recent data .
because of this , the reports tend to be conservative in nature and have consistently underestimated the urgency of the problem so far . new climate related studies almost invariably reveal a problem unfolding faster than we had previously expected , which is why greenpeace wants to see decision-makers getting the most up to date information available . " this is the kind of information that we need to have -lrb- to get -rrb- the full picture on the impacts of global warming , " kaiser said . it 's estimated that global emissions will need to fall by 40 % on 1990 levels within the decade if the arctic is to have any chance of being preserved in the condition it 's been in for the past 10,000 years . author : chiponda chimbelu editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 14.05.2010 strolling down the berlin boulevard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boulevard theater is an outdated format where theater is pure entertainment .
but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .
ben knight is playing jay , a rejected auditionee in " ladies night " at the komoedie am kurfuerstendamm from may 16 to june 13 .

future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

turkey 's eu ambitions and greece 's economic woes could be catalysts for improved relations . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has arrived in athens for talks on friday with perhaps the highest profile entourage he could muster .
turkey 's cabinet ministers for the economy , foreign trade , the interior , foreign affairs , transport , energy , education , tourism , the environment and european affairs are all part of the delegation , not to mention around 100 business leaders . greece 's and turkey 's historical differences have brought them to the brink of war on several occasions , and the two countries are looking for ways to normalize their ties .
the visit is being hailed as historic in turkey .
while that may not yet be true , many analysts believe that now is the perfect time for the neighbors to put their past behind them . " it 's definitely a perfect win-win situation , " political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university in turkey told deutsche welle .
" if these two countries can solve their joint problems once and for all , it will be fantastic for both . " greece and turkey still dispute the territorial waters of the aegean sea , and their air forces still fight mock dog-fights on a regular basis .
both countries have sizeable military budgets , primarily because of these bilateral tensions . " neither the people of greece nor turkey need new submarines or fighter jets , " said turkey 's eu affairs minister , egemen bagis , noting how strange it was that two nato members should spend billions to counter a perceived threat from each other .
this military spending has come under particularly sharp focus in greece as the country battles fiscal insolvency and a bloated public sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and turkey spend a fortune preparing to fight each other greece 's defense expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is the highest in the eu . " in order for our people to enjoy the benefits of arms-spending reductions , we must first erase the threats and create necessary trust , " said greek foreign ministry spokesman , gregory delavekouras . the cyprus question the divided island of cyprus will also be an unavoidable issue during the talks .
cyprus was split between primarily greek and turkish communities in 1974 , when turkey invaded the northern segment of the island after a coup backed by athens changed the political landscape there . the greek part of cyprus is an eu member , which has vetoed several of turkey 's eu accession chapters .
ankara is keen to join the european union , but without some kind of settlement in cyprus , this seems unlikely . " we want a resolution to the cyprus problem , " said a foreign affairs committee spokesman for the turkish parliament .
" we want to integrate further with the european union , and cyprus is a problem . " un-sponsored talks aimed at reaching a settlement for the island are underway , but in april , turkish cypriots elected a new hard-line leader who is critical of the process . insiders in ankara say prime minister erdogan will push his greek counterpart , george papandreou , to agree to expanding the un cyprus talks , including greece and turkey more directly in the negotiations . " i do fear , if these talks fail now , that we may be looking at a partition on the island of cyprus for another generation , or longer , " richard howitt , a member of the european parliament 's committee on turkey , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : without athens ' support , turkey might never get into the eu money talks if ankara has strong political motivations for resolving the cyprus issue and improving ties with greece , then athens has a host of economic reasons to seek a less frosty relationship with turkey . the roughly 100 business leaders accompanying the turkish delegation should also send a clear message to greece that political stability can have a positive economic impact , as well as reducing military costs . athens is desperately trying to reduce its runaway budget deficit and national debt , and has had to call on its eurozone partners and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to step in and help it meet its loan repayments . turkey endured similar debt problems a decade ago , soliciting financial aid from the imf , and the country has offered to share its expertise on this situation with the greek government . " there 's a lot of empathy in turkey for greece right now , " a turkish columnist for a liberal daily newspaper wrote this week .
" we know a lot about the imf , belt-tightening , union unrest , all those things .
we 've been down that road . " even though previous attempts by greek and turkish leaders to resolve their differences have failed , many analysts observe that both countries now appear to have sufficient desire to improve ties and that some kind of first step is possible . turkish political scientist cengiz aktar thinks that a comprehensive non-aggression pact could be a plausible development from the two-day visit . " i think that might have a tremendous , positive effect , especially in terms of peace dividends .
it would help the greek economy 's present and future problems . " author : dorian jones -lrb- msh -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 female hindu priests in india are making strides in a male-dominated profession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chitra lele works as a female hindu priest in pune for centuries , many hindu rituals have been performed by male priests .
but now a few institutions in pune have begun offering courses to female priests . hindu chants ring through pradnya patil 's new home .
it 's on the 11th floor of a luxury apartment building in pune .
in the sunny living room , statues of hindu gods are arranged on the floor .
a smell of incense fills the air .
a traditional house-warming ceremony is underway .
but pradnya patil has broken with tradition today - the 35-year-old has invited a woman priest to perform the ritual .
patil is convinced that women priests are better than their male counterparts .
" i recently attended a house-warming ceremony led by a male priest - it took five whole hours !
but women priests perform similar rituals in just one hour .
they explain the importance of the rituals and why they are still relevant .
they 're very sincere and committed .
now , my relatives and even my conservative father have switched to women priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mostly young , urban hindus are calling the female priests for ceremonies chitra lele sits on the floor in pradnya patil 's apartment and explains the ritual in the local language marathi .
she looks nothing like a traditional hindu priest in austere white robes .
instead , she wears a colorful silk sari and trendy rimless glasses .
the 41-year-old is married and has a teenage daughter .
she was drawn to the priesthood out of an interest in hinduism and sanskrit .
she performs all kinds of rituals : naming ceremonies , weddings as well as festivals .
she says female priests have struck a chord among young urban indians .
" we women priests explain the gist of the ritual in just one hour .
we try and involve the people watching .
so we 're popular among the young generation . "
priesthood courses women like chitra lele are challenging traditional notions of priesthood .
and they are learning to do that at pune 's dyanprabodhini center , which was started by a social reformer .
the school 's imposing stone building is located in the bustling old part of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hindu pujas are elaborate rituals that take hours more than 20 women are currently enrolled in the one-year priesthood course .
they come from all hindu castes .
most are housewives between 40 and 65 years of age .
they are trained in religious rituals and each of the 16 sacraments of hinduism .
and they ’ re taught sanskrit , the country 's classical language in which the hindu religious mantras are chanted - and which few indians understand .
" we have a great pleasure that women who are learning here are performing outside in society very confidently .
they are progressive but they still preserve our ancient traditions and culture also " , says aarya joshi , teacher of the course .
the 30-year-old explains that women priests largely perform religious ceremonies at private homes – not at temples .
and they do n't perform funerals or death rites either .
they are more widely accepted in big cities than in more conservative rural india .
joshi is a sanskrit researcher herself .
she 's working on her doctorate on hindu ancestral worship .
she points out that hinduism has never barred women from performing religious rites .
there 's even mention of them in ancient religious writings .
but later men came to dominate the profession .
they declared that priests could only be male and only from a particular hindu caste .
that thinking prevails till today .
" the problem occurs because i think that people do n't have an exact idea of women priesthood " , says joshi .
" they do n't know that this is an ancient tradition for the past 5,000 years .
it 's a typical orthodox mindset .
some 25 percent of the people are n't ready to accept women priesthood .
but we think it will change with the period of time , so we have to wait for that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in pune , female priests have become quite popular mixed reactions on the hot , busy street outside the school , people are divided about whether women should work as priests .
" i do n't think women should be conducting religious ceremonies .
our culture does n't allow it .
that 's how it 's always been , " says one man .
but another one is more open : " i do n't have a problem with women priests .
but i think it 's bad if they conduct religious ceremonies during menstruation .
it 's impure . "
a woman adds , " i think it 's good if women work as priests .
as a woman , you feel less scared talking to them than you do to male priests . "
male resistance back at the school , joshi says the main opposition to women priests usually comes from the male clergy .
" actually male priests , who are performing rituals in the traditional ways , have a great worry about their source of income because this is their bread and butter . "
anand pandharpure agrees .
he 's been working as a priest for the last 20 years , having been trained at an early age by his own father .
he says that to become a hindu priest , men have to undergo rigorous daily training at special religious schools for at least 7 to 8 years .
the 40-year-old is dismissive of what he calls " priesthood light " courses for women .
" you face many complex questions as a hindu priest " , says pandharpure .
" but women often ca n't answer them because they only get superficial training .
and i think people are being fooled when so-called women priests shorten religious rituals .
it 's more like entertainment .
it gives priesthood a bad name . "
pandharpure is dressed in the traditional clothes of a hindu priest – a white dhoti and a black peaked cap .
he rejects the idea that women priests pose a threat to him and his male colleagues .
" women often turn to priesthood after 40 , once their kids have grown up , and they have nothing to do .
but i do n't think that ’ s right .
priesthood is not just a hobby .
it 's an important responsibility .
for us men , being priests is a lifelong learning experience .
but frankly we do n't take the issue of women priests too seriously – their numbers are really negligible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a laptop puja : tradition and modernity tend to blend well in india hindu rituals in english they may not be taken seriously by some , but female priests are increasingly charting their own course in the male-dominated field .
manisha shete has been working as a priest for three years .
the cheerful 40-year-old has found a new target group for her services .
" nowadays i conduct a lot of marriages in english because indians who go abroad increasingly marry foreign partners .
but they 're keen on having an indian wedding .
and indian parents who live overseas often want their children to learn about their culture .
but the children do n't understand marathi .
so i conduct the thread ceremony – a rite of passage for boys - in english . "
the simplified rituals in english can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions .
" a father of one of the boys once came to me and said ' you know , my thread ceremony was done decades ago – but it 's only now that i understand why it was done and what it meant " ' , laughs manisha shete .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .

the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .

france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

a research team , backed by greenpeace , has set off on a unique expedition to measure the likely impact of current rates of warming on the region . for climate scientists , the arctic is like the proverbial canary in the mineshaft .
because it 's so sensitive to change , it serves as an alarm for global trends . on friday -lrb- 14.05.2010 -rrb- , a team of scientists is setting off from kiel , germany , on board the greenpeace ship esperanza to measure just how dramatically the region could be affected by current warming scenarios . the greenpeace " arctic under pressure expedition " aims to carry out unique experiments , which are to be among the first to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- levels on arctic marine life . getting close to nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant containers will capture arctic water samples the arctic 's ice cover reflects a significant portion of planet-warming sunlight back into space .
as ocean water does the exact opposite , losing arctic ice can have a self-reinforcing effect . as well as absorbing sunlight , the world 's oceans also suck up carbon dioxide .
with co2 levels rising in the atmosphere , oceans are taking on ever-greater amounts and becoming more acidic in the process . rising temperatures and rising acidity pose a dual threat to marine organisms that are unaccustomed to the abrupt changes taking place in their habitat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.05.2010 question box brings rural india online , one village at a time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new question box was recently installed in shirur a basic device is helping indians get online without being in front of a computer .
the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .

the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .

the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .

france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 14.05.2010 question box brings rural india online , one village at a time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new question box was recently installed in shirur a basic device is helping indians get online without being in front of a computer .
the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "
the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .
japan and luxembourg followed with 79 percent of their software being legally installed .
all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .
if software piracy in the asia-pacific region were reduced by 10 percentage points , regional economies would gain $ 41 billion , with 435,000 jobs and $ 5.4 billion in taxes being created , he said at a press briefing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many companies use more expensive business software from producers like sap bsa focuses its legal efforts on companies while using public relations measures to appeal to the ethics of individual users in an effort to convince them to pay for their software , according to herrnleben .
illegal software , he noted , may also make company databases vulnerable to hackers as unregistered programs often do not receive security updates .
" there is also a factor of lost effectiveness ; software is an extremely important tool and is necessary to do good work , ” herrnleben said .
“ that 's why we generally focus our criminal and civil law activities on companies . "
at the beginning of may , bsa started a 30-day grace period in germany during which companies can register the software they use and correct any illegalities without facing repercussions .

the united states engaged in the least amount of software piracy in 2009 , with 80 percent of the software on its computers being legal .

all businesses affected according to bsa vice president jeffrey hardee , software piracy affects small and medium-sized companies as well as multinational corporations .

losses top $ 50 billion , and in some countries more than 90 percent of software is illegally copied . the amount of pirated software being used around the world edged toward 50 percent in 2009 as personal computer markets grew in brazil , india and china .
an average 43 percent of software used in 2009 was illegal , up from 41 percent in 2008 , according to the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- .
while the rampant piracy cost companies some $ 51 billion -lrb- 40 million euros -rrb- in 2009 , losses were three percent less than in 2008 .
bsa estimates 28 percent of software on german computers was illegal in 2009 , and the value of that software was comparatively high at 1.59 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.02 billion -rrb- .
significant financial loss georg herrnleben , bsa director for central and eastern europe , said more significant financial loss probably occurs in the companies rather than in the private sphere .
while private users are more likely to install pirated software on their computers , the financial implications of that trend have yet to be studied .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg herrnleben says pirated software is a security risk to companies " companies naturally always use multiple computers , but they also tend to use much more complex and expensive software , " herrnleben told deutsche welle .
" the most important result is certainly on the international level – the fact that piracy rates , or the percentage of illegal software on the market , increased during the past year , " he said .
rates differ by country software piracy rates decreased in 54 of the 111 surveyed economies .
the rates stayed the same in 38 and increased in 19 .
in the republics of georgia , moldova and zimbabwe , they were more than 90 percent .
" we are certainly dealing with a situation in which piracy rates in the so-called western european countries – in industrialized countries – are less than in eastern europe , ” herrnleben said .
“ however , we need to keep in mind that piracy rates in western europe have stayed the same or even increased a bit .
in comparison , we 're seeing an ongoing positive trend in eastern europe in which piracy rates are decreasing . "

but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .
ben knight is playing jay , a rejected auditionee in " ladies night " at the komoedie am kurfuerstendamm from may 16 to june 13 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 14.05.2010 strolling down the berlin boulevard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boulevard theater is an outdated format where theater is pure entertainment .
but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .
ben knight is playing jay , a rejected auditionee in " ladies night " at the komoedie am kurfuerstendamm from may 16 to june 13 .

a research team , backed by greenpeace , has set off on a unique expedition to measure the likely impact of current rates of warming on the region . for climate scientists , the arctic is like the proverbial canary in the mineshaft .
because it 's so sensitive to change , it serves as an alarm for global trends . on friday -lrb- 14.05.2010 -rrb- , a team of scientists is setting off from kiel , germany , on board the greenpeace ship esperanza to measure just how dramatically the region could be affected by current warming scenarios . the greenpeace " arctic under pressure expedition " aims to carry out unique experiments , which are to be among the first to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- levels on arctic marine life . getting close to nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant containers will capture arctic water samples the arctic 's ice cover reflects a significant portion of planet-warming sunlight back into space .
as ocean water does the exact opposite , losing arctic ice can have a self-reinforcing effect . as well as absorbing sunlight , the world 's oceans also suck up carbon dioxide .
with co2 levels rising in the atmosphere , oceans are taking on ever-greater amounts and becoming more acidic in the process . rising temperatures and rising acidity pose a dual threat to marine organisms that are unaccustomed to the abrupt changes taking place in their habitat .
sensitive creatures like plankton and corals are among the most critically threatened . this is already well known , but the idea of the greenpeace expedition is to simulate arctic conditions as true to nature as possible . " the idea is to have an experiment in situ , " said ulf riebesell , head of acidification research at the university of kiel . " we do n't want to take the organisms into the lab .
we want to study them where they occur .
and we do n't want to study individual organisms .
we want to study the entire ecosystem with all its components , " he said . riebesell will be joining the international team of scientists off the norwegian arctic island of spitsbergen in five weeks time for what he says is one of the first attempts to project the impact of rising co2 levels on-site in a region that is " particularly sensitive to acidification . " big beaker tubes called mesocosms , taller than a double-decker bus , will be lowered 17 meters into the ocean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corals are among the most sensitive marine species when it comes to changes in habitat there , nine of these tubes will collect 50,000 litres of water each .
the mecocosms will be exposed to different treatments , designed to reflect levels of co2 and warming over the coming decades , to see how the region might be expected to hold up . the team of researchers from germany , the uk , and the us will also examine glacier-melting in greenland and the effects of industrial fishing in previously inaccessible regions during the four-month expedition . but the goal is more than just realizing scientific data . despite the mounting evidence of climate change , polls suggest that public support for action to tackle the problem has waned in recent months .
so esperanza 's mission to the arctic also hopes to add to pressure on politicians to take urgent action . " unfortunately , in copenhagen we could n't see the politicians follow science , especially on -lrb- the -rrb- emissions reduction issue , " said martin kaiser , greenpeace climate politics coordinator . the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports that provide the scientific basis for negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take years to compile , and often lack the most recent data .
because of this , the reports tend to be conservative in nature and have consistently underestimated the urgency of the problem so far . new climate related studies almost invariably reveal a problem unfolding faster than we had previously expected , which is why greenpeace wants to see decision-makers getting the most up to date information available . " this is the kind of information that we need to have -lrb- to get -rrb- the full picture on the impacts of global warming , " kaiser said . it 's estimated that global emissions will need to fall by 40 % on 1990 levels within the decade if the arctic is to have any chance of being preserved in the condition it 's been in for the past 10,000 years . author : chiponda chimbelu editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

because it 's so sensitive to change , it serves as an alarm for global trends . on friday -lrb- 14.05.2010 -rrb- , a team of scientists is setting off from kiel , germany , on board the greenpeace ship esperanza to measure just how dramatically the region could be affected by current warming scenarios . the greenpeace " arctic under pressure expedition " aims to carry out unique experiments , which are to be among the first to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- levels on arctic marine life . getting close to nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant containers will capture arctic water samples the arctic 's ice cover reflects a significant portion of planet-warming sunlight back into space .
as ocean water does the exact opposite , losing arctic ice can have a self-reinforcing effect . as well as absorbing sunlight , the world 's oceans also suck up carbon dioxide .
with co2 levels rising in the atmosphere , oceans are taking on ever-greater amounts and becoming more acidic in the process . rising temperatures and rising acidity pose a dual threat to marine organisms that are unaccustomed to the abrupt changes taking place in their habitat .
sensitive creatures like plankton and corals are among the most critically threatened . this is already well known , but the idea of the greenpeace expedition is to simulate arctic conditions as true to nature as possible . " the idea is to have an experiment in situ , " said ulf riebesell , head of acidification research at the university of kiel . " we do n't want to take the organisms into the lab .
we want to study them where they occur .
and we do n't want to study individual organisms .
we want to study the entire ecosystem with all its components , " he said . riebesell will be joining the international team of scientists off the norwegian arctic island of spitsbergen in five weeks time for what he says is one of the first attempts to project the impact of rising co2 levels on-site in a region that is " particularly sensitive to acidification . " big beaker tubes called mesocosms , taller than a double-decker bus , will be lowered 17 meters into the ocean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corals are among the most sensitive marine species when it comes to changes in habitat there , nine of these tubes will collect 50,000 litres of water each .
the mecocosms will be exposed to different treatments , designed to reflect levels of co2 and warming over the coming decades , to see how the region might be expected to hold up . the team of researchers from germany , the uk , and the us will also examine glacier-melting in greenland and the effects of industrial fishing in previously inaccessible regions during the four-month expedition . but the goal is more than just realizing scientific data . despite the mounting evidence of climate change , polls suggest that public support for action to tackle the problem has waned in recent months .
so esperanza 's mission to the arctic also hopes to add to pressure on politicians to take urgent action . " unfortunately , in copenhagen we could n't see the politicians follow science , especially on -lrb- the -rrb- emissions reduction issue , " said martin kaiser , greenpeace climate politics coordinator . the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports that provide the scientific basis for negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take years to compile , and often lack the most recent data .
because of this , the reports tend to be conservative in nature and have consistently underestimated the urgency of the problem so far . new climate related studies almost invariably reveal a problem unfolding faster than we had previously expected , which is why greenpeace wants to see decision-makers getting the most up to date information available . " this is the kind of information that we need to have -lrb- to get -rrb- the full picture on the impacts of global warming , " kaiser said . it 's estimated that global emissions will need to fall by 40 % on 1990 levels within the decade if the arctic is to have any chance of being preserved in the condition it 's been in for the past 10,000 years . author : chiponda chimbelu editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .

" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .

france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .

in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

as a permanent member of the un security council , beijing is calling for a diplomatic approach towards iran 's nuclear program and for a stop to the sanctions . iran is the second largest supplier of oil to the people 's republic of china and within the first nine months of 2009 , it became largest market for the investment of chinese companies in construction and projects . fariborz laghaie likes to trade with the chinese .
the successful businessman from teheran imports a number of goods , among them , electronics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , left , greets chinese president hu jintao he has been flying frequently to china for the past three years .
he says china 's influence on the iranian market is growing by the day .
" of course sanctions against iran play a big role .
but those who do business with the chinese know the saying : the chinese never say no to anyone .
chinese companies have won many jobs in various sectors in iran in the past years . "
the iranian market is flooded with ' cheap products ' from china - from textiles and toys to dvd players and the latest models of mobile phones .
experts in iran have cautioned against the chinese competition , saying it jeopardizes iran 's industry and job market .
but it has been in vain , says laghaie : " we still do n't have strict laws governing the volume and quality of imports from china .
the majority of iranians can not afford to buy expensive , high-quality products .
on the other hand , the chinese authorities do not have the capacities to control everything that is produced in and exported from such a large country .
so everyone just does what they want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of phase five of the south pars gas field in the southern port of assaluyeh , iran oil deals with china are kept secret the iranian economy is mostly centralized and is almost completely state-controlled .
in the iranian economy , corruption is a wide-spread problem .
in its latest corruption index , transparency international has ranked iran 168 of 180 countries .
this year , china became iran 's number one trade partner .
china exports mainly weapons to the isolated country in return for oil and gas .
the oppositional journalist mehdi mohseni is surprised .
" nobody knows about oil deals with china in iran .
outside of iran is where i heard about it and i was really shocked .
china is only known to us in our country because of its cheap products . "
aside from cheap products , people in iran hardly know anything about china , although both cultures have been linked by the silk road for centuries .
iranians do n't hear about things like the tiananmen massacre nor about the brutal crackdown of chinese security forces on demonstrators in tibet and xinjiang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese and iranian officials hold talks iranian lawyer , human rights defender and nobel peace prize winner , shirin ebadi , criticizes the country 's blindness .
" the chinese government exploits the rights of its people to a great extent - just like the iranian government .
whenever a moslem is killed in the middle east , the iranian government makes a huge deal out of it .
but when thousands of muslim uighurs are killed in china , they say nothing .
and they make sure the press says nothing . "
shirin ebadi has observed how the iranian people are starting to see through the government despite censored media coverage .
she says now , when the state marches on the streets shouting " down with america and down with israel " , the people shout instead , " down with russia " and " down with china . "

" i am confident that the novel and courageous step we are attempting today can pay off because the will is there , " greek prime minister george papandreou said at a joint news conference held with erdogan .
erdogan is the first turkish prime minister to make an official visit to greece since 2004 .
the leaders used their meeting to establish a new greek-turkish high cooperation council , under which the two are to meet annually .
immigration agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has blamed turkey for failing to stop illegal immigrants from reaching greek islands the turkish prime minister later signed a bilateral agreement with his greek counterpart , george papandreou , pledging to accept at least 1,000 requests to repatriate illegal turkish immigrants living in greece . it was one of over 20 bilateral agreements that the two sides signed on friday , on topics ranging from tourism to energy .
regional foes for centuries , greece and turkey have been on the brink of war as recently as 1996 .
their relationship has improved over the last decade , though animosity still runs high over the status of cyprus and the sovereignty of the aegean sea .
cutting defense spending in greece , the perceived threat from fellow nato-member turkey has fueled high levels of military spending .
erdogan told greek public television on thursday that he hoped that the bilateral talks would result in the two countries being able to reduce military spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the only country that recognizes the government of the self-declared turkish cypriot state " both countries have huge defense budgets and they will achieve a lot of savings in this way , " he said .
greece 's defense expenditure is the highest as a proportion of gross domestic product of any country in the european union , a fact that could hardly be ignored as the country was forced to accept an eu-international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- bailout to combat its staggering debt load . turkey , too , was forced to seek financial help from the imf in 1991 in order to restructure its economy after a financial crisis , an experience could provide common ground for talks with greece. smh / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

aside from cheap products , people in iran hardly know anything about china , although both cultures have been linked by the silk road for centuries .
iranians do n't hear about things like the tiananmen massacre nor about the brutal crackdown of chinese security forces on demonstrators in tibet and xinjiang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese and iranian officials hold talks iranian lawyer , human rights defender and nobel peace prize winner , shirin ebadi , criticizes the country 's blindness .
" the chinese government exploits the rights of its people to a great extent - just like the iranian government .
whenever a moslem is killed in the middle east , the iranian government makes a huge deal out of it .
but when thousands of muslim uighurs are killed in china , they say nothing .
and they make sure the press says nothing . "
shirin ebadi has observed how the iranian people are starting to see through the government despite censored media coverage .
she says now , when the state marches on the streets shouting " down with america and down with israel " , the people shout instead , " down with russia " and " down with china . "

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .
" the extension of daycare facilities is one of these priorities , and you can not throw it overboard just like that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the debate on how to do that is just beginning .

because it 's so sensitive to change , it serves as an alarm for global trends . on friday -lrb- 14.05.2010 -rrb- , a team of scientists is setting off from kiel , germany , on board the greenpeace ship esperanza to measure just how dramatically the region could be affected by current warming scenarios . the greenpeace " arctic under pressure expedition " aims to carry out unique experiments , which are to be among the first to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- levels on arctic marine life . getting close to nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant containers will capture arctic water samples the arctic 's ice cover reflects a significant portion of planet-warming sunlight back into space .
as ocean water does the exact opposite , losing arctic ice can have a self-reinforcing effect . as well as absorbing sunlight , the world 's oceans also suck up carbon dioxide .
with co2 levels rising in the atmosphere , oceans are taking on ever-greater amounts and becoming more acidic in the process . rising temperatures and rising acidity pose a dual threat to marine organisms that are unaccustomed to the abrupt changes taking place in their habitat .
sensitive creatures like plankton and corals are among the most critically threatened . this is already well known , but the idea of the greenpeace expedition is to simulate arctic conditions as true to nature as possible . " the idea is to have an experiment in situ , " said ulf riebesell , head of acidification research at the university of kiel . " we do n't want to take the organisms into the lab .
we want to study them where they occur .
and we do n't want to study individual organisms .
we want to study the entire ecosystem with all its components , " he said . riebesell will be joining the international team of scientists off the norwegian arctic island of spitsbergen in five weeks time for what he says is one of the first attempts to project the impact of rising co2 levels on-site in a region that is " particularly sensitive to acidification .

the mecocosms will be exposed to different treatments , designed to reflect levels of co2 and warming over the coming decades , to see how the region might be expected to hold up . the team of researchers from germany , the uk , and the us will also examine glacier-melting in greenland and the effects of industrial fishing in previously inaccessible regions during the four-month expedition . but the goal is more than just realizing scientific data . despite the mounting evidence of climate change , polls suggest that public support for action to tackle the problem has waned in recent months .
so esperanza 's mission to the arctic also hopes to add to pressure on politicians to take urgent action . " unfortunately , in copenhagen we could n't see the politicians follow science , especially on -lrb- the -rrb- emissions reduction issue , " said martin kaiser , greenpeace climate politics coordinator . the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports that provide the scientific basis for negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take years to compile , and often lack the most recent data .
because of this , the reports tend to be conservative in nature and have consistently underestimated the urgency of the problem so far . new climate related studies almost invariably reveal a problem unfolding faster than we had previously expected , which is why greenpeace wants to see decision-makers getting the most up to date information available . " this is the kind of information that we need to have -lrb- to get -rrb- the full picture on the impacts of global warming , " kaiser said . it 's estimated that global emissions will need to fall by 40 % on 1990 levels within the decade if the arctic is to have any chance of being preserved in the condition it 's been in for the past 10,000 years . author : chiponda chimbelu editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a research team , backed by greenpeace , has set off on a unique expedition to measure the likely impact of current rates of warming on the region . for climate scientists , the arctic is like the proverbial canary in the mineshaft .
because it 's so sensitive to change , it serves as an alarm for global trends . on friday -lrb- 14.05.2010 -rrb- , a team of scientists is setting off from kiel , germany , on board the greenpeace ship esperanza to measure just how dramatically the region could be affected by current warming scenarios . the greenpeace " arctic under pressure expedition " aims to carry out unique experiments , which are to be among the first to explore the effects of rising carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- levels on arctic marine life . getting close to nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giant containers will capture arctic water samples the arctic 's ice cover reflects a significant portion of planet-warming sunlight back into space .
as ocean water does the exact opposite , losing arctic ice can have a self-reinforcing effect . as well as absorbing sunlight , the world 's oceans also suck up carbon dioxide .
with co2 levels rising in the atmosphere , oceans are taking on ever-greater amounts and becoming more acidic in the process . rising temperatures and rising acidity pose a dual threat to marine organisms that are unaccustomed to the abrupt changes taking place in their habitat .
sensitive creatures like plankton and corals are among the most critically threatened . this is already well known , but the idea of the greenpeace expedition is to simulate arctic conditions as true to nature as possible . " the idea is to have an experiment in situ , " said ulf riebesell , head of acidification research at the university of kiel . " we do n't want to take the organisms into the lab .
we want to study them where they occur .
and we do n't want to study individual organisms .
we want to study the entire ecosystem with all its components , " he said . riebesell will be joining the international team of scientists off the norwegian arctic island of spitsbergen in five weeks time for what he says is one of the first attempts to project the impact of rising co2 levels on-site in a region that is " particularly sensitive to acidification .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 14.05.2010 strolling down the berlin boulevard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boulevard theater is an outdated format where theater is pure entertainment .
but in recent years , english plays and films have started to influence this incomparable genre in berlin - with rejuvenating effects . folk-dancing aside , it is hard to think of an art form less cool than boulevard theater - the populist german stage entertainment whose best anglo-saxon equivalent could be the 1970s tv sitcom .
the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .
popular as it is - it remains a relic .
the average boulevard poster - featuring actors ' faces tortured into various expressions of comic exuberance - rarely attracts the slouching , tight-trousered , international youth for which the german capital is famed .
this is the favored cultural recreation of elderly , affluent west berliners , who can remember a time when west berlin 's theatrical scene was robust , massively popular and its myriad forms were heavily subsidized .
so many venerable west berlin theaters have closed down - or had their public funding withdrawn - since the old days , including the schillertheater -lrb- where samuel beckett himself directed a german production of " waiting for godot " -rrb- , the schlossparktheater -lrb- where hildegard knef made her debut -rrb- , and the tribuene -lrb- where marlene dietrich appeared as a girl , and wassily kandinsky designed sets -rrb- .
these examples have led not a few old-timers to grumble that the city 's left-wing government has allowed west berlin 's theatrical landscape to decline in order to fund the monster institutions in the eastern part of the city - thriving stages like the volksbuehne , the staatsoper , the deutsches theater , and the berliner ensemble .
future uncertain for berlin theater the last major surviving institution of west berlin 's golden era is the privately-funded theater am kurfuerstendamm , the home of the boulevard comedy .
the twin theaters -lrb- the theater am kurfuerstendamm is coupled with the slightly smaller komoedie am kurfuerstendamm -rrb- were opened in the 1920 's , when the kurfuerstendamm was celebrated as one of europe 's culture-defining thoroughfares .
the theater am kudamm preserved the best traditions of german light entertainment throughout the last century , but is now being threatened with closure , as the irish property investor ballymore seeks to redevelop the faded shopping center that occupies the same building , forcing the closure of at least one of the stages .
having lost its bid for preservation on the grounds of its history , the theater is currently operating in limbo - its last valid rent contract ran out in september 2008 .
all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .
ben knight is playing jay , a rejected auditionee in " ladies night " at the komoedie am kurfuerstendamm from may 16 to june 13 .

all that appears to be keeping the theater alive , apart from reliable success , is the nostalgic will of local theater-goers , who started a citizens ' initiative on may 1 .
if the initiative collects 7,200 signatures from local residents by june , it would force the city council to hold a plebiscite on the future of the two theaters .
slow death or slow anglicization but even a successful referendum would be non-binding , and the committed support of local politicians will be relatively powerless to turn back the property market .
a defeatist would say the closure of the kudamm theaters is unstoppable , sooner or later , and a cynic might add that the problem is not the abstract grind of profit in the real estate business , but the outdated aesthetic of boulevard comedy itself , whose audience is steadily aging .
but at least the cynic would be wrong , because anyone who actually suspends their internal style police and crosses the tacky marble foyers in the kudamm theaters might find some brilliant theater .
and i 'm not just saying that because i 'm in a show there this month .
being english and performing in a german boulevard show offers an odd insight .
so many comedies on the german boulevard stage are translations of english plays -lrb- dinosaurs like alan ayckbourn , neil simon and willy russell are never far from the repertoire in a certain kind of german theater -rrb- , but this particular show - " ladies night , " a massively successful version of the 1997 movie " the full monty " that has toured germany 's boulevard circuit in many versions for the best part of a decade - is a full realization of slightly old-fashioned english comedy transplanted into a wholly german tradition .
and there are no seams .
for reasons that are not only to do with the inherent excitement of seeing a naked penis , the show 's blend of self-deprecating humor and unabashed sentiment never fails to spark gales of hilarity in the charlottenburg classes , who appear en masse every night in their blue hair and their best brass-buttoned , dark-green blazers .

the comparison is imperfect , but the stereotyped characters , the free use of running gags and the unashamed recourse to toilet humor all remind you of the uncomplicated light entertainment of olden days tv .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.05.2010 ackermann interview sparks debate on greek rescue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo ackermann says greece is unlikely to pay its debt deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann told german public television that he doubted greece could pay off its debt .
this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier has called on the coalition to revisit ist spending plans koch singled out the government 's plan to grant all children under three years of age access to daycare facilities by 2013 .
he called on berlin to abandon the scheme , adding that there must be no taboos in the debate on where to reduce spending over the next few years .
future generations in for a raw deal ?
chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .
" although i see the need for budgetary cuts , we need to stick to our priorities in our policies , " schroeder said .

turkey 's cabinet ministers for the economy , foreign trade , the interior , foreign affairs , transport , energy , education , tourism , the environment and european affairs are all part of the delegation , not to mention around 100 business leaders . greece 's and turkey 's historical differences have brought them to the brink of war on several occasions , and the two countries are looking for ways to normalize their ties .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 ecumenical event in germany aims to instill trust in churches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are seeking orientation , says the co-president of event " the church is not only about abuse " is the message the ecumenical kirchentag , a meeting between germany 's churches , endeavors to relay .
re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

the red shirts remain defiant to calls to end the rallies . security forces resorted to firing – mostly rubber bullets and tear gas - in a bid to control the protesters and to restrict access to the rally site at rajprasong in central bangkok 's hotel and commercial district .
a mass transit skytrain station in silom was attacked by m79 grenades . the operation is an effort by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to end the two month long anti-government protests that have led to increasing costs to the economy .
the government has also extended an emergency decree to 15 other provinces in order to prevent more protesters from traveling to the capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai buddhist monk moves past thai soldiers as they erect barricades on friday clashes between security forces and protesters killed at least seven people .

since the rallies began in mid-march over 30 people have died and more than 1,000 were injured . ' dangerous situation ' key roads were closed , mass transit systems were disrupted and many shops and businesses were shut for the day in areas close to the anti-government barricades . sunai pasuk , representative for human rights watch in thailand , says the situation is becoming increasingly difficult for the government . " this is a very dangerous situation .
the government needs to operate with extreme care the rules of engagement – the use of lethal force can only be approved in order to protect public safety and in the case of self defence .
nothing should be allowed beyond that .

he is suspected to have been responsible for grenade attacks against pro-government demonstrators in late april .
he remained in a critical condition in hospital .
but there was little sympathy for the man in the silom area of bangkok , now under military protection . a resident mr lek says seh daeng was a bad person and the red shirt rally was taking an increasing toll on the local economy in silom and rajprasong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an anti-government demonstrator throws cement blocks at a truck near lumpini park hardliners remain defiant up to 30,000 troops and police have been deployed as part of the operation . the military action followed the collapse of a reconciliation road map put forward by mr. abhisit .
human rights watch 's pasuk says it appears some moderate red shirt leaders have fled the protest site . " the hardliners have taken over command so with that we do n't have any voices of reason left in the decision making of the reds , " says pasuk .

but some members of her party have called for plans to increase spending to improve child care and education to be reexamined . faced with record-high public debt and lower tax revenue than expected , budget cuts seem unavoidable in germany .
just ahead of a national education summit in berlin on may 17 , the debate on where and how to save has turned to the fields of child care , education and research .
roland koch , the christian democrat premier of the central state of hesse , set the ball rolling by arguing that the federal government should reconsider its plans spend more on education and child care .
" there was a policy objective to spend 10 percent of our gdp on education by 2015 , " koch told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" but that is n't feasible anymore , given our budgetary constraints . "

chancellor angela merkel however ruled out making budget cuts would affect education or child care . education , research and child care were set out as priorities for this government in the coalition agreement between merkel 's christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . this is not up for discussion , a government spokeswoman told reporters in berlin on friday .
family affairs minister kristina schroeder was equally quick to dismiss the idea .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder says cuts to education and child care are not an option education minister annette schavan called the proposed cuts extremely short-sighted .
she warned that cuts in the education system would backfire and mean nothing short of increased welfare costs in the longer term .
" we can not leave future generations to deal with massive public debt and an education system full of weaknesses to boot , " schavan told public german broadcaster ard on friday .
" it does n't make any sense at all to me to call for cuts in the fields of education and research . "
not a voice in the wilderness but koch 's controversial suggestion did not only draw criticism and condemnation .
saxony premier stanislaw tillich told the financial times deutschland newspaper that spending more money on education would not necessarily lead to improvement .
he argued that at a time when the government is facing a budgetary squeeze , there must be other ways to improve education rather than to continue pumping more resources into it .
otto fricke , spokesman for budgetary affairs for the free democrats made a similar argument .
" if it now turns out that we have no money for tax cuts in the years ahead , it stands to reason that we can not afford any additional expenditures for educational schemes either , " fricke said .
in order to keep in line with the eurozone 's stability and growth pact , which requires member nations to keep their deficits below three percent of gross domestic product , germany will have to make structural cuts of at least 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- by 2014 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 ecumenical event in germany aims to instill trust in churches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are seeking orientation , says the co-president of event " the church is not only about abuse " is the message the ecumenical kirchentag , a meeting between germany 's churches , endeavors to relay .
re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .
russia , however , continues to eye nato expansion to the east with mistrust and unease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato reconnaissance plane in 1994 , nato intervened in the war in ex-yugoslavia to prevent systematic ethnic violence by serbs against croatians and bosnians .
the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .
members : bildunterschrift : nato headquarters at present , there are 28 nato member states .
they are : albania , belgium , bulgaria , canada , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , france , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , slovakia , slovenia , spain , turkey , the united kingdom and the united states .
france withdrew from nato 's military structure in 1966 but rejoined in 1995 .
structure : nato 's headquarters are located in brussels .
its top official is the secretary general , currently anders fogh rasmussen from denmark .
the largest and most powerful member is the united states , but no american has ever officially headed the organization .
nato decisions are made by unanimous accord and not by majority voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen nato does not raise troops of its own .
instead , nato forces are compromised of those from the militaries of its member states .
the man who ultimately issues orders to nato troops is the supreme allied commander europe -lrb- saceur -rrb- .
that post is always filled by a senior us military officer and is currently occupied by navy admiral james stavridis .
in addition , nato also has an extensive civilian structure .
future : the collapse of communism and the warsaw pact led many people to question nato 's continuing relevance .
the alliance 's intervention in the balkans in the 1990s showed that nato could be used as a force for creating stability , even when no member states were under direct threat .
since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .
in eastern europe , nato plans to try to improve its ties with russia while leaving the doors open for other states in that region to become members .
nato would also like to deepen its cooperation with non-european democracies such as japan and australia .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

here is an overview of the most important facts . history : " to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down , " that was how nato 's first secretary general characterized the purpose of the military alliance after it was formed in 1949 .
nato member states agree to defend one another - that is the core of the alliance .
article v of the nato treaty states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . "
with the outbreak of the korean war , the main focus of the alliance emerged as defending western europe and north america against potential threats form communist states , particularly the soviet union .
west germany became a nato member in 1955 , and the soviet union responded that same year by creating the warsaw pact , an alliance of communist states in eastern europe .
with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the frontlines were redrawn .
the cold war was over , and the warsaw pact dissolved , with many of its former members joining nato .

the prolonged bombing campaign against serbia the following year represented a use of force that was not purely defensive , being justified instead by humanitarian considerations .
the collective defense clause of the original nato treaty was invoked for the first time after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
after the united states toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , nato took over command and remains in charge of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in that country .

since 2001 , islamist terrorism and facing the challenges of asymetrical warfare have been among nato 's principle concerns , and the success of the war in afghanistan is considered a major litmus test .
some observers fear that should nato forces fail to achieve their mission of establishing a stable state friendly to the west in afghanistan , the united states could lose interest in the alliance .

the question box lets users tap into the web via telephone operators .
its founders say it could help bridge the world 's digital divide . living without the internet has put much of the world 's population at a disadvantage .
farmers have been forced to sell crops without knowing the market price , students ca n't access the full range of available information and job seekers miss out on the latest opportunities . for gawri bapusaheb dhokle , it meant ignoring her curiosity .
the 12-year-old student lives in pune , in india 's western state of maharashtra , which was heavily affected by swine flu .
gawri wanted to know more , but she was unsatisfied after reading the local newspapers .
with no way to get online , her questions simply went unanswered .
more than five billion people are trapped in this information vacuum - and the question box is being touted as a potential solution .
the rectangular device uses a mobile phone , which connects to a local operator sitting in front of a computer with internet access .
the user can ask any question in their local language and the operator will surf the web to track down the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : question boxes cost between 100 and 250 euros , plus operator salaries shirur village finds answers gawri 's small village of shirur recently had a question box installed .
on the first day of operation , she stepped up to the speaker , pushed a green button and asked for help in her local language , marathi .
" how many people were detected with swine flu in pune ? " she asked .
there was a brief delay while the operator searched , then an answer came back : " forty-six people died and 864 people are living with swine flu . "
finally , gawri had the information she 'd been searching for .
she said in the future , she 'll ask question box .
question boxes are installed at 10 locations in pune , from rural villages to urban slums .
the devices are cheap to build and run , with the simplest version costing 100 euros , while a more sophisticated version equipped with gps technology costs 250 euros . an additional expense is the 300-euro monthly salary of the local language operator .
funding comes from the national internet exchange of india -lrb- nixi -rrb- and private donors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure problems in noida led to the relocation of test boxes in pune the question box in shirur is located at the maher ashram , a refuge for 180 women and children .
nestled between sugar cane farms and modest village houses , the ashram provides shelter to people with nowhere else to go , including female divorcees and young orphans .
maher founder sister lucy kurien , 54 , said question box was useful for students who need help with homework and want to find out about exam results .
although that information has been available online , students could n't access it - until now .
" it has been very difficult for them , unless they get -lrb- the information -rrb- from the newspaper or the radio , " she said .
" and we have a simple television program , but we do n't have a television cable connection .
it has been very difficult . "
the question box also enables the ashram 's women and older children to ask about taboo topics like sexual health .
sexual education is limited in indian schools and even prohibited in some states due to religious opposition .
sister lucy kurien said the stigma surrounding sex leaves some too embarrassed to ask ashram staff .
what indians want to know when exam results are released or crops are ready for market , each question box is inundated with up to 50 calls .
on slower days , it is just a handful .
heavy traffic also occurs during important cricket matches .
the crowd in shirur asked how india had fared against south africa in a test match .
when the operator announced the south african team had thrashed the home team , the group groaned and booed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ugandans successfully utilized question boxes to answer agricultural questions dr. nikhil agarwal , chairman of open mind trust india and director of the europe asia business school , oversees question box 's indian operation .
dr. agarwal said the main benefit of the question box was allowing people to gain access to current information .
in a country where only 81 million out of a total 1.1 billion people are online , that 's a rare luxury . “ still , there are a lot of people who do not have access to basic information , which is available to the educated , urban class , " he said .
despite india 's 490 million mobile phone users - the second highest number worldwide - dr. agarwal said the country still faces a " great digital divide . "
testing the technology question box has been in operation in india since 2007 .
trial boxes were first installed in noida but have since been relocated to pune due to a lack of supporting infrastructure .
the technology was also tested last year in uganda in partnership with the grameen foundation and focused on solving agricultural problems .
the five-month trial was deemed successful , with almost 2,000 farming-related questions asked .
but operators ran into several major obstacles : they lacked access to crop prices in the local market and were slowed by uganda 's poor internet speed and reliability .
without additional funding , there are no plans to continue operating in uganda .
dr. agarwal said question box encountered a universal problem in both india and uganda .
users were so daunted by the wealth of information available to them for the first time , they did n't know where to start .
and there was another unexpected challenge : in one pune village , a row broke out between political parties after rival groups took credit for the question box .
bildunterschrift : students at the maher ashram in shirur can use the device for homework help looking ahead plans to expand the reach of question box are under way .
an online toolkit is being developed , which will allow organizations to download and use the technology with local hotlines , regardless of their location .
an application is also before the indian central government 's ministry of communication and information technology to fund 100 additional question boxes in pune . if the proposal is approved , jostling between local political parties could prove intense , as each group scrambles to claim responsibility .
but with enough question boxes at their fingertips , locals will have the tools to find out who really deserves the credit .

chinese companies have won many jobs in various sectors in iran in the past years . "
the iranian market is flooded with ' cheap products ' from china - from textiles and toys to dvd players and the latest models of mobile phones .
experts in iran have cautioned against the chinese competition , saying it jeopardizes iran 's industry and job market .
but it has been in vain , says laghaie : " we still do n't have strict laws governing the volume and quality of imports from china .
the majority of iranians can not afford to buy expensive , high-quality products .
on the other hand , the chinese authorities do not have the capacities to control everything that is produced in and exported from such a large country .
so everyone just does what they want . "

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .

" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .

this set off a new debate about whether the greek bailout will work - and the future of the euro . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann walked a narrow line thursday when he expressed his doubts on public broadcaster zdf that greece will be able to pay down its debts despite a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 138 billion -rrb- international rescue package .
ackermann was more optimistic about the success chances of a separate 750 billion euro fund intended to aid faltering economies in spain and italy .
" i have my doubts about whether greece is really in a position to step up its efforts , " ackermann said in the zdf interview .
the rescue package is in part a political maneuver intended to show european resolve to secure its joint currency and maintain solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current financial rescue gives greece temporary liquidity chancellor angela merkel said thursday as polish prime minister donald tusk was awarded the charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding that the european union is facing an " existential " crisis .
" if the euro fails , it 's not just the currency that fails , but europe and the idea of european unification , " she said , adding that if the crisis can be overcome , " europe will be stronger than ever before . "
while ackermann said on zdf the european union is sure to lose the money it invests in greece , he emphasized the necessity of avoiding a greek bankruptcy .
that would lead to a " kind of meltdown " and would " very certainly affect other countries , " he said .
tricky situation according to friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , ackermann found himself in a tricky situation .
he needed to act as a public figure capable of drumming up support and , at the same time , protect his creditability .
greece will unlikely be able to pay off its nearly 300 billion euro debt , but the rescue package will enable it to hold out for a few more years , according to heinemann .
" in the end , there will be a restructuring of greece 's debt … but in the meantime before that happens , other countries will make such progress that the danger of a meltdown will no longer exist , " he told deutsche welle .
" this means maybe in 2012 a restructuring of greece 's debt can be undertaken without shock waves being triggered . "
euro-skepticism but other economists are less optimistic about the future of the common european currency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economist joachim starbatty is skeptical about the future of the euro joachim starbatty , professor emeritus of economics at the university of tubingen , said greece should end its use of the euro .
instead , the country should return to its former currency , the drachma , and devalue it based on market factors , he said .
" solidarity does n't mean that we should all sink into this swamp of debt , ” starbatty told deutsche welle .
“ solidarity means each country should have an opportunity to ascend again economically . "
if greece were to use a devalued drachma , the favorable exchange rate would make its exports more competitive and its tourism industry more attractive , according to starbatty .
" it is the only possible solution ; they do n't have solid economic ground under their feet anymore , " he said .
" i 'm advocating a solution with which a long-term future for greece and europe can be secured .
the politicians are sticking their heads in the sand and believe they can make debts disappear by creating new debts . "
problem only delayed in contrast to starbatty , heinemann believes deutsche bank ceo ackermann was correct to say the euro does have a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis has led to violent demonstrations in greece " ackermann is right , " heinemann said .
" every expert who looks at the situation will come to the conclusion that the subsidies will bridge greece 's liquidity problem , but not solve the insolvency problem .
but keep in mind that these troubled nations states have an enormous desire to reduce their expenditures , and at the moment the global economy is playing along . "
ansgar belke , of the german institute of economic research in berlin , said while ackermann 's speech was " practical and adept , " greek debt is sure to present more problems in the future .
the country 's savings ratio is low , he said , and its ability to collect taxes owed is insufficient .
" i think in the future we 'll find ourselves confronted with the same problem , and then we 'll have to pay again , " belke told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.05.2010 ecumenical event in germany aims to instill trust in churches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are seeking orientation , says the co-president of event " the church is not only about abuse " is the message the ecumenical kirchentag , a meeting between germany 's churches , endeavors to relay .
re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

re-instilling trust among the public could be a tall order . still reeling from scandals , both the protestant and catholic churches have much to make up for in their fall from grace .
while the catholic church must atone for now countless reports of sexual abuse of children in its schools and organizations , the german protestant church is still trying to grapple with the shock-waves following a drunk-driving charge that prompted their former leader to resign in february .
the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .

the second ecumenical kirchentag , a conference being held from may 12-16 in munich , looks to soften the blow of the scandals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alois glueck took up his post as president of the central committee of german catholics in november deutsche welle spoke with the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , about his take on the kirchentag 's mission of fostering dialogue among christians and those of other denominations .
deutsche welle : the catholic church is in its biggest crisis ever ; the protestant church is in a slightly better position .
how have you been able to mobilize some 100,000 people to attend the kirchentag event ?
alois glueck : because the church is not just about abuse .
it is a painful chapter , an uncomfortable reality , and of course many people are worried .
the risk that people will become alienated from the church is there .
on the other hand , participants at the kirchentag and the public will see how lively the churches are .
people will see that the churches are not just the sum of their problems , but at the same time , we are addressing the abuse very openly .
many people are interested in the kirchentag , both participants and the media alike , because we are living during a time when people around the world are searching for orientation .
so , we are at the right place at the right time .
bildunterschrift : fewer people are participating in this year 's kirchentag than in the previous one in 2003 but you are also addressing the scandals involving sexual abuse - how ?
we are very open about the subject .
we have organized two major discussion events about the topic , and are offering counseling sessions .
one of the events addresses more of the societal problem ; abuse is generally suppressed throughout society .
the other event looks specifically at the experiences in the catholic church , and the conclusions that can be drawn from them .
the german film and theater director christoph schlingensief has said that , for the time being , he would not leave the catholic church .
many others hold the same view .
is that some kind of defiant stance , along the lines of " now i really will remain a member of the church " ?
those who are truly faithful - who have a strong connection to their faith and their church - and do not see it as an institution of glory , but as a mediator of their faith , should not be led astray by the misconduct of individuals or the problems resulting from structural insufficiencies .
we all feel bad about the church , especially those who have been very committed .
but it still remains our church , and we are involved and devoted .
the shockwaves are still being felt , but surely the crisis also offers us all potential for growth .
that will be a decisive question : whether the crisis , as so often in history , will launch a new era .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former head of the german protestant church , margot kaessmann , spoke at the kirchentag this is the second ecumenical kirchentag .
the first one , in berlin in 2003 , drew some 200,000 participants - twice as many as this year .
is that a sign that ecumenism is also in crisis ?
ecumenism is not merely a subject matter for church directors or theologians ; it is shared life and cooperation among christians .
and that got a bigger push in berlin .
the different numbers of participants do n't really play much of a role , but the city where the event takes place does .
hundreds of individual churches have worked and prayed together to organize this second kirchentag , and to get projects going .
the motto " christians in and for the world " stands side-by-side with the theological theme " so that you have hope , " and that is reflected in thousands of events .
you just mentioned the theme " so that you have hope . "
did you not hit the nail on the head in two ways by choosing that theme , even though when it was selected , you could n't have predicted the abuse scandal ?
it 's not just about the current crisis the church is in .
there is a lot of despondency and insecurity about our future among members .
of course , the bible does not offer us pat solutions for these concrete problems , but on the other hand , i do hope that we , as people of faith , can show that god has a human dimension , that he became human in form , and therefore understands our existence and our woes .
and that he accompanies us on our path through life and helps us .
that 's why there is a dimension there in terms of life orientation that goes beyond the rational .
what is the aim of the kirchentag , in your opinion ?
that we can grow together even more , and that we can experience the diversity of christian life .
the kirchentag provides the potential for enrichment and offers new impetus for individuals , for our churches and for the societal questions of our time .
alois glueck is president of the central committee of german catholics , a lay organization of the catholic church .
he is also one of the two presidents of the ecumenical kirchentag , the other being protestant .

" i am confident that the novel and courageous step we are attempting today can pay off because the will is there , " greek prime minister george papandreou said at a joint news conference held with erdogan .
erdogan is the first turkish prime minister to make an official visit to greece since 2004 .
the leaders used their meeting to establish a new greek-turkish high cooperation council , under which the two are to meet annually .
immigration agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has blamed turkey for failing to stop illegal immigrants from reaching greek islands the turkish prime minister later signed a bilateral agreement with his greek counterpart , george papandreou , pledging to accept at least 1,000 requests to repatriate illegal turkish immigrants living in greece . it was one of over 20 bilateral agreements that the two sides signed on friday , on topics ranging from tourism to energy .
regional foes for centuries , greece and turkey have been on the brink of war as recently as 1996 .
their relationship has improved over the last decade , though animosity still runs high over the status of cyprus and the sovereignty of the aegean sea .
cutting defense spending in greece , the perceived threat from fellow nato-member turkey has fueled high levels of military spending .
erdogan told greek public television on thursday that he hoped that the bilateral talks would result in the two countries being able to reduce military spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the only country that recognizes the government of the self-declared turkish cypriot state " both countries have huge defense budgets and they will achieve a lot of savings in this way , " he said .
greece 's defense expenditure is the highest as a proportion of gross domestic product of any country in the european union , a fact that could hardly be ignored as the country was forced to accept an eu-international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- bailout to combat its staggering debt load . turkey , too , was forced to seek financial help from the imf in 1991 in order to restructure its economy after a financial crisis , an experience could provide common ground for talks with greece. smh / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the red shirts remain defiant to calls to end the rallies . security forces resorted to firing – mostly rubber bullets and tear gas - in a bid to control the protesters and to restrict access to the rally site at rajprasong in central bangkok 's hotel and commercial district .
a mass transit skytrain station in silom was attacked by m79 grenades . the operation is an effort by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to end the two month long anti-government protests that have led to increasing costs to the economy .
the government has also extended an emergency decree to 15 other provinces in order to prevent more protesters from traveling to the capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai buddhist monk moves past thai soldiers as they erect barricades on friday clashes between security forces and protesters killed at least seven people .

since the rallies began in mid-march over 30 people have died and more than 1,000 were injured . ' dangerous situation ' key roads were closed , mass transit systems were disrupted and many shops and businesses were shut for the day in areas close to the anti-government barricades . sunai pasuk , representative for human rights watch in thailand , says the situation is becoming increasingly difficult for the government . " this is a very dangerous situation .
