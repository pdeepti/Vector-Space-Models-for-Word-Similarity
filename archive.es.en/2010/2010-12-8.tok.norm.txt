program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 08.12.2010 germany rejects criticism in eurozone bonds spat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over eurozone crisis management continue the tit-for-tat over proposals for joint eurozone bonds continued wednesday , with eurogroup head jean-claude juncker and german chancellor angela merkel trading terse remarks over economic crisis management in the eu . a war of words erupted wednesday between germany and eurogroup leader jean-claude juncker over eurozone crisis discussions .
the row has been brewing since monday , when germany flatly rejected on legal and economic grounds a proposal by juncker for joint eurozone bonds .
in an article to be published thursday in german weekly die zeit , juncker labeled the german reaction as " un-european , " and attacked the government of chancellor angela merkel for not taking a proper look at his proposal - aimed at helping weaker eurozone countries like greece , ireland and portugal raise money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says germany is being un-european " they are rejecting an idea before studying it ...
this way of creating taboo areas in europe and not dealing with others ' ideas is a very un-european way of dealing with european matters , " said juncker , who is also luxembourg 's prime minister .
" germany is thinking a bit simple on that , " he added .
the joint bonds - or e-bonds - could help eurozone members seen as having unstable public finances lower their borrowing costs .
as it stands , the interest that weaker eurozone states must pay out on government bonds stands at more than double - and sometimes triple - the interest paid by stronger members , such as germany .
it is believed such high interest rates for irish and greek bonds contributed to both countries having to seek huge loans from the eu and international monetary fund recently - 110 billion euros and 85 billion euros respectively .
german reaction merkel retorted to juncker 's comments on his e-bond proposal by saying his words were causing unease on world markets .
the yield on a 10-year german government bond recently shot up to 3 percent from 2.4 percent in early november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says juncker 's comments are causing market instability " it does n't help anyone in europe if european figures call each other un-european , " commented merkel 's spokesman steffen seibert in a regular government briefing .
" it is exactly this talking against other people and about other people which should stop , because the markets definitely see this finger-pointing as a sign of discord . "
" the german government remains opposed to the proposal .
the legal and economic concerns about the euro bonds will remain in place for the weeks ahead , " he added .
merkel herself called for " calm " ahead of an eu leaders ' summit next friday , where talks will focus on creating a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone and what the chancellor called " narrow " changes to eu treaties .
" i think that we should work in a calm and goal-oriented manner towards what awaits us next friday .
this calm manner is my contribution to making sure we are successful next friday , " merkel told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 08.12.2010 ' radiagate ' provokes soul-searching among indian journalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corporate lobbyist niira radia is being questioned by law enforcement agencies leaked recordings of phone conversations with a lobbyist have raised suspicions that some of india 's most influential journalists served as power brokers for a deal that is considered one of india 's biggest scams ever . the revelations have shocked the public and upset the media world .
a controversy involving high-profile journalists and their taped telephone calls has given india its own wikileaks-style storm .
it has been termed the " radiagate " .
india 's own ' mediagate ' top journalists are heard in conversations with influential lobbyist niira radia after the 2009 general elections , discussing who should be in the next cabinet .
radia worked as a lobbyist for two of india 's biggest industrialists : mukesh ambani , head of reliance industries , and ratan tata , whose conglomerate 's interests include phone operator tata teleservices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's former communications and information technology minister a. raja in the taped conversations , niira radia was apparently pushing for a. raja , a south indian politician , to be reinstated as a minister .
as telecom minister before the election , raja had overseen the sale of the lucrative 2g phone licences at rock bottom prices - which is now turning out as potentially one of the biggest corruption cases in indian history .
it is estimated to have cost the exchequer over $ 35 billion in lost revenues .
transcripts of the 104 tapes , many of which have been printed by two news magazines , " open " and " outlook " , have called into question the reputations of , among others , celebrity anchor barkha dutt and veteran newspaper columnist vir sanghvi .
both deny any wrong-doings .
but hartosh singh bahl , the political editor of " open " , points out that there is a larger problem .
" the people who have been caught on tape are by no means the only ones who have been part of this cosy relationship .
this extends far beyond the few journalists who have been named or have been seen on tape .
whether it leads to a larger cleanup in the immediate future , i am not so sure .
there will be a certain sense of caution .
but till journalists as a whole try to organize themselves in a way , enforce a code of ethics in day-to-day work , i am not sure things will change in the long run . "
time for introspection eminent sociologist dipankar gupta agrees that there is a need for serious introspection by the mainstream media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' radiagate ' controversy has caused a heated debate about media ethics " the lesson that the media should learn is that they are really judged in the court of the people .
and what they do must not only seem legal but also proper .
and over the years they have become a little complacent because of their closeness with powerful people , the rich and the powerful . "
the controversy has caused heated debates among journalists , in press clubs and other forums .
" this is a wake-up call because now it is out in the open .
it concerns a few people in the media but unfortunately these people are of high profile .
and i think a large number of people in the media are conscientious regarding their business and this should help them realize what they should not do .
i think sometimes what they should not do is more important than what they should do , " dipankar gupta argues .
the controversy is far from over and could possibly mark a new chapter in indian journalism .

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 08.12.2010 music hotel brings new beat to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the trendy hotel class with berlin 's indigenous underground music scene ?
berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .

berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .

the 54-year old , who has dedicated his life to the fight for more civil rights in china , has been declared an enemy of the state . liu xiaobo has been known as one of the most prominent critics of the chinese regime for decades .
the civil rights activist has been in jail for nearly two years now .
this is not the first time that he has been locked up - the first time was after the bloody crackdown on the chinese democracy movement in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1989 : a student blocks a line of tanks near tiananmen square " i was on my bike home .
it was about midnight .
a car was following me and forced me to stop .
a couple of people came out , " liu recalled in a 2007 interview with deutsche welle .
" they blindfolded me , tied me up and pushed me into the car .
i was really scared .
i thought that they would take me somewhere and just shoot me . "
' duty ' to fight for justice liu xiaobo , who had studied literature , had taken the side of the chinese students fighting for more democracy on tiananmen square in 1989 .
after two years in jail , his will to fight was still not broken .
again , he was detained in 1995 and 1996 .
but he continued the struggle , explaining , " many innocent people were killed during the tiananmen massacre .
i believe that it is my duty to fight for justice to those who gave their lives .
it is a duty that i can not abandon , " he said .
charter ' 08 in late 2008 , liu xiaobo was arrested once more .
he had been one of the main initiators of the so-called ' charter ' 08 ' manifesto , which was published on the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights . the manifesto called for political reforms in china , including a system of checks and balances , freedom of speech and a competitive multi-party democracy .
as many as ten thousand intellectuals and academics have signed the petition so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo 's wife liu xia is under constant surveillance " many in his position would have given up .
but xiaobo has the mental strength .
if he believes in a goal , he 'll try to reach that goal by all means , even if he knows that he will never be able to reach it , " liu xia , his wife , had said in an interview .
" he can be really stubborn . "
she had had an uneasy feeling and sensed that the communist party would let her husband pay dearly for the charter ' 08 .
sentenced for ' subversion ' in december 2009 , a chinese court sentenced liu xiaobo to eleven years in jail on subversion charges .
in 2007 , he had already anticipated what could happen to him .
" i ’ ve once said that it is a dissident ’ s professional hazard to lose his freedom and being under surveillance .
it is part of a dissident ’ s job , " he told deutsche welle .
" it is your own choice .
you can do other things , be a salesman or a teacher , and earn easy money .
but as soon as you decide to be a dissident , you should withstand pressure with optimism , self-confidence and composure . "
committee defies china liu xiaobo is serving his sentence in a detention facility 500 kilometers northeast of beijing .
once a month he is allowed to receive visitors .
the chinese authorities have harshly protested against the pro-democracy activist receiving the nobel peace prize .
the executive secretary of the norwegian nobel committee geir lundestad reported that the chinese government explicitly threatened the committee not to give the prize to liu .
the decision would have a negative impact on chinese-norwegian relations , beijing said .
bildunterschrift : liu has been sentenced to eleven years in prison for ' subversive ' activities liu had also anticipated this kind of a move : " some european politicians fear that a discussion about human rights can have a negative impact on their economic relations with china .
i don ’ t think so .
the political relationship between china and japan is full of tensions .
but china 's trade relations with japan are among the largest with any country .
so you can see that both these two things do not have anything to do with each other . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 08.12.2010 world bank wants climate funding to be scaled up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank says climate funding does have its problems in an exclusive interview , the world bank 's special envoy for climate change tells deutsche welle about the problems climate funding is facing and why the world bank wants to lend a helping hand . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , the world bank is already a major provider of loans to developing countries to help them tackle climate change and shift toward renewable energy technologies .
they manage 6.3 billion dollars -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- worth of climate investment funds which are allocated to 43 countries .
deutsche welle interviewed andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , to find out what role the world bank wants to play in shaping future climate funding .
dw : what 's working well in the system of climate funding and what are the current flaws in the system ?
andrew steer : i think there 's a lot that is working well , but it 's not yet happening at the scale that is required .
we are the manager for example of the climate investment funds that we implement together with the regional development bank . the good thing about them is the leverage that they get .
by putting in relatively modest amounts of grant money , one can change the behavior of private investors in quite a good way .
so for example the biggest cif is the clean technology fund which is a 4 billion dollar fund .
as a result of that , there will be a total of 40 billion dollars of investment in clean technology .
so it 's a sort of ten to one ratio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steer says large-scale solar energy projects will generate revenue for developing countries .
unfortunately there will never be enough public grant money available to solve all the problems so the name of the game will be to make sure we get this degree of leverage where public funds , private funds and carbon market funds come together .
that 's an example of a positive story .
now overall it is true that some countries are finding that there are too many sources of funding and it 's all a bit complicated , so one of the things we did here in cancun was to launch a website together with undp -lsb- united nations development agency -rsb- that basically tries to untangle the spaghetti .
it will cut out a lot of the transaction costs that are normally associated with financing .
the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- which has played a very good role , is in need of overhaul .
delays are quite considerable , transaction costs are quite high , and predictability of the system is not what it needs to be .
and also money tends to go to a small number of middle income countries .
so we have been favoring reform of the cdm that would reduce costs , increase predictability and would extend the markets into low income countries .
dw : to what extent is the world bank best placed to manage climate investment funds ?
andrew steer : we are not seeking to fly our own flag .
we are simply offering to be helpful .
our speciality is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
we need to now get serious about the problem .
that requires an agency that can operate with large financial packages , engage with governments on monetary issues , bring together different types of finance and that has engagement across a range of sectors .
and we are privileged to have expertise and experience in those areas .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have protested against the world bank in cancun dw : you say you can play a helpful role .
if that 's the case , why are people in cancun demonstrating today against the world bank being in charge of climate assistance ?
andrew steer : i 'm not aware of them demonstrating against it .
views understandably differ .
that 's healthy .
we 're not for one moment suggesting that the world bank is uniquely qualified , but we do believe we have a very helpful role to play .
dw : a lot of this funding is actually loans .
tove ryding , a representative from greenpeace , has said that giving developing countries loans to help them deal with the consequences of climate change caused primarily by developed nations is " the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage . "
what do you say to that ?
andrew steer : this is for negotiators to decide .
that 's why we 're here in cancun .
it 's not the world bank that decides to make it loans rather than grants .
the world bank gives grants , but it also gives zero interest loans for some investments in renewable energy and some investments we give loans that have market based rates .
those decisions are made by the providers of funds and those are represented here by the parties .
i would make just one point and that is , the countries we are working in - and we are working in over 130 countries on climate change - are saying to us , ' we want to get on with it .
we want to be part of a green industrial revolution .
we want to make our economy grow rapidly in a climate resilient way and we want to have access to resources . '
it 's very encouraging because we 're seeing a lot of leadership in developing countries as they want to get on with things and if the choice is between a grant or a loan , you or i or anybody else would prefer a grant .
but that depends on whether or not the countries that are providing the funds want to provide them as grants .
if they do n't , then it 's very encouraging that , nonetheless , a lot of developing countries are getting on with it .
they do n't want to just talk about it .
they want to actually do it .
we believe that cancun really needs to deliver .
it 's possible , it could deliver something very important and we 're really hoping that in the next few days we 'll see that .

he told deutsche welle that wikileaks unilaterally announced wikileaks.ch as the official domain name last week . wikileaks announced on friday on twitter that its new official domain name was wikileaks.ch , which is owned by the pirate party of switzerland .
like its counterparts around europe , the party stands for reform of copyright law , abolishing the patent system , the right to privacy , and other digital issues . wikileaks.ch forwards to wikileaks ' site , which is currently being hosted in france .
other european domain names , including wikileaks.de for germany , and wikileaks.fi for finland , also point to the new host .
to learn more about the relationship between the swiss pirate party and wikileaks , deutsche welle spoke with denis simonet , the party 's president . deutsche welle : when did you acquire the wikileaks.ch domain name and why did you decide to acquire it ? denis simonet : that was six months ago based on a request from the pirate party of switzerland .
wikileaks is one sign of a problem that has to be solved .
we are for free speech , free media .
the media has to safeguard the media and if they ca n't do it or do n't do it , then our democracy is in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switch , the swiss registrar , told simonet that there is no reason to block wikileaks.ch did you buy the domain as a measure of support for wikileaks , or did wikileaks ask you to do it ? we did so for ourselves .
we do n't host content anyway .
it 's just a re-direction to the servers .
there are many other servers that do the same .
you can just register a domain and forward it .
it 's no big issue .
we did n't ask to do it .
we just did it because a member thought that it was something the pirate party should do to show support . how did you come into contact with wikileaks and with julian assange ? that was a totally different story .
about three or four weeks ago , he announced in the press that he was seeking a request for political asylum in switzerland .
our board decided that because the reason that he has to request asylum is that he is the media spokesperson for wikileaks and that he is in danger now because he is the media spokesperson .
we thought that switzerland could position itself internationally as a place where freedom of media , freedom of opinion and information is of highly considered status .
that 's why i tried to get in contact with julian assange , so we could help him . the help was to inform him about how switzerland works , about how we have a direct democracy , our federal system of cantons .
i explained the political and administrate landscape in switzerland .
that was a big part of the discussion .
he just listened .
he did n't ask for help , he did n't say anything about whether it helps or if he will stay in switzerland or what his future plans are .
he just said " thank you , " and that 's it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange met with simonet in geneva in november what was he like ?
was he at ease ?
did he seem nervous ? he explained to us what the wikileaks philosophy is .
what he 's said in public is what he is .
he was exactly what i expected .
he has a cause and he wants this cause to be known by the world . did you mention that you had the wikileaks.ch domain name ? no , not at all .
wikileaks.ch was n't part of our discussion .
there was no agreement between us .
wikileaks decided unilaterally to communicate wikileaks.ch as the working , official domain name .

the commission said wednesday it would delay the cancellation of subsidies until 2018 . germany has won concessions from the european union on coal subsidies paid out to loss-making mines .
the eu commission said wednesday it would push back a phase-out date on subsidies by four years to 2018 .
the commission had said in july that failing mines would have to be closed by 2014 , arguing that subsidies were bad for the environment and promoted unfair competition .
but germany fiercely protested , saying that the subsidies kept its coal industry afloat , and that a 2014 phase-out would endanger too many jobs .
job security for some 25,000 workers employed at five mines around germany would have been threatened by a 2014 deadline .
berlin welcomed the commission 's decision as " a great success , " government spokesman steffen seibert said wednesday .
the extension of coal subsidies to 2018 would enable germany to meet its social obligations to the country 's miners , he added .
the premier of germany 's saarland state , which is home to one of the country 's largest mines , welcomed the eu decision to yield to german pressure .
peter mueller said the continuation of subsidies until 2018 was a " socially acceptable solution for miners without redundancy deals . "
the four-year moratorium on mine closures should also be long enough to allow germany to restructure its coal industry without sustaining considerable losses .
of the 26 other eu member states , only romania and spain will be directly affected by the new subsidies deadline .
the deal is to set to be endorsed by eu competition ministers on friday .
environmental group greenpeace 's energy policy expert , frauke thies , said that in 2008 the german government had subsidized each individual job in unprofitable coal mines to the tune of 235,000 euros -lrb- $ 311,000 -rrb- .

but there 's a gap - called the gigaton gap - between what governments have pledged and what climate researchers have said is needed . " if the voluntary commitments in copenhagen were to be implemented , " said achim steiner , director of the united nations environment program , at the cancun summit , " and i put the conditional on because none of us have a guarantee at the moment that they will be implemented , then we would be 60 percent of the way of where we need to be by 2020 in addressing a climate change action program that would allow the world to still have an opportunity to stay within the two degree range . " two-degree limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increase of more than two degrees celsius would have major effects on life on earth limiting global warming to two degrees will be crucial for avoiding its worst effects and may be the cut off point for us to have any chance of doing something about the problem of climate change , according to joseph alcamo , the united nations environment program 's chief scientist . " around two or two-and-a-half degrees would be roughly the level at which there would be an increasing frequency of extreme climate events , where there would be much higher risk of reaching tipping points in the climate system , " he told deutsche welle . to have a good chance of keeping warming below the two-degree level , the scientists behind a un emissions report presented in mexico said global emissions will need to peak at around 44 gigatonnes , or 44 billion tones , by the end of the decade . if no action is taken there would be a 12-gigaton gap between actual emissions and what 's needed to limit climate change to a two degree increase by 2020 .
that 's the equivalent of about 25 percent of current emissions .
but if countries fulfill their promises the gap would be seven gigatons , alcamo said . " we can go 60 percent of the way simply by fulfilling ambitions expressed in the copenhagen accord , " he said , pointing out that the most optimistic implementation of the copenhagen accord would leave the world five gigatons short of what researchers say is necessary . more to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more use of renewable energy sources could help cut the gigaton gap but even the current best-case scenario is pockmarked with caveats still up for negotiation .
issues including like an agreement on forestry , climate finance for developing countries as well as resisting tricky accounting rules that disguise increases in emissions as decreases are all yet to be decided on . policymakers will need to dig deeper and they 'll need to do it sooner rather than later since all models for keeping warming below two degrees have one thing in common , according to ramzi elias of the european climate foundation . " all of them that have a likely chance of limiting warming to two degrees have emissions levels that peaked and started to decline before 2020 , " he told deutsche welle .
" therefore , what we do over the next 10 years is really crucial . " leaving the big investments needed for a transition to a low carbon economy until after 2020 would likely be too late because of the cumulative nature of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , elias said . costly undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are already suffering the effects of climate change but if the costs seem steep now , closing the gap completely will likely be doubly expensive , according to michel den elzen of the netherlands ' environmental assessment agency .
he put the price tag for current copenhagen promises at between $ 60 billion and $ 100 billion . " to close the gap , i think it is in the order of 0.3 percent of the worldwide gdp , " he told deutsche welle , adding that it would be equal to about $ 200 billion . uk climate secretary chris huhne , however , said the costs of inaction were even higher , pointing out that the extreme weather events of 2010 were a taste of things to come . " anybody who is any doubt about that please go and talk to the big insurance companies , because they are paying out for this , " he said . " just in the uk alone over the last 10 years , the payout for flooding was 4.5 billion pounds , whereas in the 10 years before that it was 1.5 billion pounds .
this is hard business evidence of the costs that are being inflicted on our economies and we have to tackle this problem .

he faces charges of manslaughter and robbery .
the controversial trial will shine a spotlight on turkey 's legal system . nearly 20 years after fleeing to germany from his native turkey , author dogan akhanli has gone before an istanbul courtroom on wednesday facing charges of robbery and manslaughter .
the 53-year-old akhanli , who has lived in germany since 1991 and holds german citizenship , is charged with involvement in an armed robbery at a currency exchange office in istanbul in 1989 .
his lawyers told the court they would seek an acquittal for their client , who , they said , had been blackmailed under torture and was the subject of a fabricated case .
a delegation of akhanli 's supporters has traveled to istanbul for the trial , among them german author guenter wallraff , who said earlier wednesday that akhanli had revoked statements allegedly given under torture .
" if due process is considered here , he must be released .
and i expect this to happen , " wallraff said .
" he is a colleague who has been innocently arrested . "
his publisher regip zarakoglu , meanwhile , said " they couldn ’ t punish akhanli for his writings , so they ’ re trying to pin another crime on him . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff called for akhanli 's immediate release germany 's foreign ministry is also expected to be closely watching the trial .
akhanli is receiving consular assistance , and the ministry is in contact with lawyers in cologne and istanbul , according to a spokesperson .
author 's perspective akhanli said earlier through his lawyer : " if i wasn ’ t being threatened with a life sentence , i ’ d have to laugh about my situation .
i feel like franz kafka ’ s tragic-hero josef k. , and not just because i ’ ve been arrested even though i ’ m innocent . "
the cologne-based political author was arrested on august 10 after returning to turkey for the first time since his escape to visit his ailing father who later died at the end of november without seeing his son .
since august , akhanli has been held in a prison in the province of tekirdag .
following his arrest , akhanli was also charged with a political offense , as prosecutors have said the crime was part of a move to destabilize the constitutional order in the country .
if convicted , he faces life in prison .
akhanli 's lawyer haydar erol has claimed the criminal charges are based on witness statements that were either fabricated or obtained through torture .
he said one witness , the son of the exchange office owner killed during the robbery , later disputed ever having identified akhanli in a photograph .
in addition , erol said akhanli 's fingerprints were never found at the scene .
" the scenario was produced by the police , " erol told german press agency dpa in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armenian massacre during world war i left few survivors a belated settling of accounts erol said the author 's arrest was a belated settling of accounts with the political left .
he has called for akhanli 's release and for the legal proceedings to be discontinued .
after the turkish military coup in 1980 , akhanli went underground and was arrested four years later for being a member of the revolutionary communist party of turkey -lrb- tdkp -rrb- .
he was imprisoned from 1985 to 1987 , during which time he said he was tortured .
living in cologne for the past two decades , akhanli , who has won awards in turkey and germany for his writing , has worked with the research association recherche international to uncover and study the genocides of the last century , in particular the ottoman empire 's massacre of armenians during world war i. his work has led some to believe he was targeted for writing on the topic .
it remains a sensitive subject in turkey , which has refused to classify the event as genocide .
' no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has refused to classify the armenian massacre as genocide akhanli 's arrest has led to demonstrations in germany and his supporters , among them amnesty international , fellow authors , intellectuals and politicians , plan to follow the trial closely .
" there is no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody , " said selami guerel , a friend and supporter .
" we expect that he will be released after the first day in court . "
the berlin academy of arts has called for international protests against akhanli 's arrest , and along with various european human rights organization and legal associations has demanded " freedom and justice .

if talks in cancun fail , he will go on with his struggle . just a few weeks ago , chen faqing turned up at the mexican embassy in beijing .
he told the officials there he wanted to donate 250,000 yuan to the climate summit in cancun – with no conditions .
the embassy officials were a little skeptical at first but then the money was transferred – exactly 37,022 dollars and 21 cents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming has an increasing effect on the arctic region with glaciers shrinking chen said it was money well spent : " we only have this world .
some countries are only thinking of economic development and their national interest .
but that will harm all humanity .
protecting the earth has to be a priority . "
chen has already used up a good deal of his savings for his crusade .
he has donated 40,000 us dollars to the secretariat of the intergovernmental panel on climate change in geneva and he has taken out ads in the international press , such as the wall street journal and the economist , too .
" i hope that thanks to my advertisements all the governments will understand what a catastrophe climate change is .
the chinese people 's newspaper refused to print my ad , saying it could lead to diplomatic pressure , " he said .
activism triggered by local water pollution in his adverts , chen presents himself as a disabled farmer although this is only partly true .
however , he is very hard of hearing .
he started off poor but worked his way up – rearing poultry and cattle and making various investments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate during the un climate summit in cancun he first became interested in the environment at the end of the 1990s as more and more people in his village started contracting lung disease .
he was concerned that the rivers were being polluted by the local factories .
for years , chen tried in vain to pressure the local authorities into acting against the pollution .
he then tried to sue them ; then he tried to sue the environment ministry in beijing , and even prime minister wen jiabao but all in vain .
everybody has to work together " the government has to bear more responsibility regarding greenhouse gases .
the world will only be saved if everybody does something , " he insisted .
he said he refused to give up his fight , even if no deal was reached in cancun : " next year , i will continue taking out adverts in the international media and i will donate money to support further climate talks . "
the mexican government had arranged for chen to be present in cancun , like all big donors but he refused .
he says he ca n't speak english .
moreover , he was urgently needed at home in his village – his wife had hoped he would spend his life savings on building a new house , not on saving the planet .

a new unicef report finds that most kids attach great importance to family cohesion , friendship and trust . a survey compiled on behalf of unicef and officially released in berlin on wednesday takes a closer look at which social values six to 14-year-old kids in germany cherish the most . information gathered in 1,500 interviews has led the authors of the study to conclude that the vast majority of children are very highly value-oriented .
" we do n't see any decline in values in this age group as some scientists want to make us believe , " said professor hans bertram from berlin 's humboldt university during the presentation of the survey .
" values such as mutual trust , and increasingly also respect for other people 's opinions and life experiences , are extremely important for children here . "

but what counts most for children is family cohesion , the study says .
" of course , many kids do have problems with their parents once in a while , " said gerd bruene from the geo publishing house which was involved in the survey .
" but the kids want to feel safe and protected , and they clearly associate this with their families . "
working parents are not a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when parents are away , the children can play the study also reveals that most children here have learned to deal with the fact that many parents – increasingly also mothers – have to stay away from home for a long period to pursue their jobs .
but they enjoy the time they can spend together with their parents who are credited with largely keeping job-related problems away from the kids .
" the kids feel that there 's often a lack of time for working mothers to spend with them , " said sociologist hans bertram .
" but many youngsters also feel they have more freedom to pursue their own activities while their mothers are away . "
german children fully accept the primary role of both parents and teachers to instill values of social behavior in them . only a small proportion would make use of the media for this , and even fewer care about what religious leaders or politicians tell them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo opinion -pipe- 08.12.2010 opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange is in custody in the uk , over swedish charges of sexual misconduct .
deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .
" it 's a different mentality .
that 's also what makes the city unique - that so many different cultures coexist . " author : rebecca schmid editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told deutsche welle that wikileaks unilaterally announced wikileaks.ch as the official domain name last week . wikileaks announced on friday on twitter that its new official domain name was wikileaks.ch , which is owned by the pirate party of switzerland .
like its counterparts around europe , the party stands for reform of copyright law , abolishing the patent system , the right to privacy , and other digital issues . wikileaks.ch forwards to wikileaks ' site , which is currently being hosted in france .
other european domain names , including wikileaks.de for germany , and wikileaks.fi for finland , also point to the new host .
to learn more about the relationship between the swiss pirate party and wikileaks , deutsche welle spoke with denis simonet , the party 's president . deutsche welle : when did you acquire the wikileaks.ch domain name and why did you decide to acquire it ? denis simonet : that was six months ago based on a request from the pirate party of switzerland .
wikileaks is one sign of a problem that has to be solved .
we are for free speech , free media .
the media has to safeguard the media and if they ca n't do it or do n't do it , then our democracy is in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switch , the swiss registrar , told simonet that there is no reason to block wikileaks.ch did you buy the domain as a measure of support for wikileaks , or did wikileaks ask you to do it ? we did so for ourselves .
we do n't host content anyway .
it 's just a re-direction to the servers .
there are many other servers that do the same .
you can just register a domain and forward it .
it 's no big issue .
we did n't ask to do it .
we just did it because a member thought that it was something the pirate party should do to show support . how did you come into contact with wikileaks and with julian assange ? that was a totally different story .
about three or four weeks ago , he announced in the press that he was seeking a request for political asylum in switzerland .
our board decided that because the reason that he has to request asylum is that he is the media spokesperson for wikileaks and that he is in danger now because he is the media spokesperson .
we thought that switzerland could position itself internationally as a place where freedom of media , freedom of opinion and information is of highly considered status .
that 's why i tried to get in contact with julian assange , so we could help him . the help was to inform him about how switzerland works , about how we have a direct democracy , our federal system of cantons .
i explained the political and administrate landscape in switzerland .
that was a big part of the discussion .
he just listened .
he did n't ask for help , he did n't say anything about whether it helps or if he will stay in switzerland or what his future plans are .
he just said " thank you , " and that 's it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange met with simonet in geneva in november what was he like ?
was he at ease ?
did he seem nervous ? he explained to us what the wikileaks philosophy is .
what he 's said in public is what he is .
he was exactly what i expected .
he has a cause and he wants this cause to be known by the world . did you mention that you had the wikileaks.ch domain name ? no , not at all .
wikileaks.ch was n't part of our discussion .
there was no agreement between us .
wikileaks decided unilaterally to communicate wikileaks.ch as the working , official domain name .
the redirection worked for six months and we did n't change anything .
we did n't get a notice .
we just saw the tweet and then the media began to run to us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks continues to be a thorn in the side of many governments around the world have you had any contact with any law enforcement from switzerland , or anywhere else in europe , or the united states ? no .
no one .
and we have n't had any contact with wikileaks , by the way .
we do n't have contact with them anymore , since that meeting . members of the american government have said that they want wikileaks to return the data it has released and to stop its operation .
are you surprised by the government reaction from the technical side ? no .
it 's well-known that sometimes governments do n't really know what they 're talking about when it comes to technical stuff .
that 's why we exist .
no one understands what digital politics means .
we are fighting to improve that situation - we are working to have digital politics for switzerland .
i think that it wo n't help if people know that we have wikileaks.ch , but it will help if we can start discussions about digital politics . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 08.12.2010 world bank wants climate funding to be scaled up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank says climate funding does have its problems in an exclusive interview , the world bank 's special envoy for climate change tells deutsche welle about the problems climate funding is facing and why the world bank wants to lend a helping hand . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , the world bank is already a major provider of loans to developing countries to help them tackle climate change and shift toward renewable energy technologies .
they manage 6.3 billion dollars -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- worth of climate investment funds which are allocated to 43 countries .
deutsche welle interviewed andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , to find out what role the world bank wants to play in shaping future climate funding .
dw : what 's working well in the system of climate funding and what are the current flaws in the system ?
andrew steer : i think there 's a lot that is working well , but it 's not yet happening at the scale that is required .
we are the manager for example of the climate investment funds that we implement together with the regional development bank . the good thing about them is the leverage that they get .
by putting in relatively modest amounts of grant money , one can change the behavior of private investors in quite a good way .
so for example the biggest cif is the clean technology fund which is a 4 billion dollar fund .
as a result of that , there will be a total of 40 billion dollars of investment in clean technology .
so it 's a sort of ten to one ratio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steer says large-scale solar energy projects will generate revenue for developing countries .
unfortunately there will never be enough public grant money available to solve all the problems so the name of the game will be to make sure we get this degree of leverage where public funds , private funds and carbon market funds come together .
that 's an example of a positive story .
now overall it is true that some countries are finding that there are too many sources of funding and it 's all a bit complicated , so one of the things we did here in cancun was to launch a website together with undp -lsb- united nations development agency -rsb- that basically tries to untangle the spaghetti .
it will cut out a lot of the transaction costs that are normally associated with financing .
the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- which has played a very good role , is in need of overhaul .
delays are quite considerable , transaction costs are quite high , and predictability of the system is not what it needs to be .
and also money tends to go to a small number of middle income countries .
so we have been favoring reform of the cdm that would reduce costs , increase predictability and would extend the markets into low income countries .
dw : to what extent is the world bank best placed to manage climate investment funds ?
andrew steer : we are not seeking to fly our own flag .
we are simply offering to be helpful .
our speciality is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
we need to now get serious about the problem .
that requires an agency that can operate with large financial packages , engage with governments on monetary issues , bring together different types of finance and that has engagement across a range of sectors .
and we are privileged to have expertise and experience in those areas .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have protested against the world bank in cancun dw : you say you can play a helpful role .
if that 's the case , why are people in cancun demonstrating today against the world bank being in charge of climate assistance ?
andrew steer : i 'm not aware of them demonstrating against it .
views understandably differ .
that 's healthy .
we 're not for one moment suggesting that the world bank is uniquely qualified , but we do believe we have a very helpful role to play .
dw : a lot of this funding is actually loans .
tove ryding , a representative from greenpeace , has said that giving developing countries loans to help them deal with the consequences of climate change caused primarily by developed nations is " the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage . "
what do you say to that ?
andrew steer : this is for negotiators to decide .
that 's why we 're here in cancun .
it 's not the world bank that decides to make it loans rather than grants .
the world bank gives grants , but it also gives zero interest loans for some investments in renewable energy and some investments we give loans that have market based rates .
those decisions are made by the providers of funds and those are represented here by the parties .
i would make just one point and that is , the countries we are working in - and we are working in over 130 countries on climate change - are saying to us , ' we want to get on with it .
we want to be part of a green industrial revolution .
we want to make our economy grow rapidly in a climate resilient way and we want to have access to resources . '
it 's very encouraging because we 're seeing a lot of leadership in developing countries as they want to get on with things and if the choice is between a grant or a loan , you or i or anybody else would prefer a grant .
but that depends on whether or not the countries that are providing the funds want to provide them as grants .
if they do n't , then it 's very encouraging that , nonetheless , a lot of developing countries are getting on with it .
they do n't want to just talk about it .
they want to actually do it .
we believe that cancun really needs to deliver .
it 's possible , it could deliver something very important and we 're really hoping that in the next few days we 'll see that .

but there 's a gap - called the gigaton gap - between what governments have pledged and what climate researchers have said is needed . " if the voluntary commitments in copenhagen were to be implemented , " said achim steiner , director of the united nations environment program , at the cancun summit , " and i put the conditional on because none of us have a guarantee at the moment that they will be implemented , then we would be 60 percent of the way of where we need to be by 2020 in addressing a climate change action program that would allow the world to still have an opportunity to stay within the two degree range . " two-degree limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increase of more than two degrees celsius would have major effects on life on earth limiting global warming to two degrees will be crucial for avoiding its worst effects and may be the cut off point for us to have any chance of doing something about the problem of climate change , according to joseph alcamo , the united nations environment program 's chief scientist . " around two or two-and-a-half degrees would be roughly the level at which there would be an increasing frequency of extreme climate events , where there would be much higher risk of reaching tipping points in the climate system , " he told deutsche welle . to have a good chance of keeping warming below the two-degree level , the scientists behind a un emissions report presented in mexico said global emissions will need to peak at around 44 gigatonnes , or 44 billion tones , by the end of the decade . if no action is taken there would be a 12-gigaton gap between actual emissions and what 's needed to limit climate change to a two degree increase by 2020 .
that 's the equivalent of about 25 percent of current emissions .
but if countries fulfill their promises the gap would be seven gigatons , alcamo said . " we can go 60 percent of the way simply by fulfilling ambitions expressed in the copenhagen accord , " he said , pointing out that the most optimistic implementation of the copenhagen accord would leave the world five gigatons short of what researchers say is necessary . more to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more use of renewable energy sources could help cut the gigaton gap but even the current best-case scenario is pockmarked with caveats still up for negotiation .
issues including like an agreement on forestry , climate finance for developing countries as well as resisting tricky accounting rules that disguise increases in emissions as decreases are all yet to be decided on . policymakers will need to dig deeper and they 'll need to do it sooner rather than later since all models for keeping warming below two degrees have one thing in common , according to ramzi elias of the european climate foundation . " all of them that have a likely chance of limiting warming to two degrees have emissions levels that peaked and started to decline before 2020 , " he told deutsche welle .
" therefore , what we do over the next 10 years is really crucial . " leaving the big investments needed for a transition to a low carbon economy until after 2020 would likely be too late because of the cumulative nature of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , elias said . costly undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are already suffering the effects of climate change but if the costs seem steep now , closing the gap completely will likely be doubly expensive , according to michel den elzen of the netherlands ' environmental assessment agency .
he put the price tag for current copenhagen promises at between $ 60 billion and $ 100 billion . " to close the gap , i think it is in the order of 0.3 percent of the worldwide gdp , " he told deutsche welle , adding that it would be equal to about $ 200 billion . uk climate secretary chris huhne , however , said the costs of inaction were even higher , pointing out that the extreme weather events of 2010 were a taste of things to come . " anybody who is any doubt about that please go and talk to the big insurance companies , because they are paying out for this , " he said . " just in the uk alone over the last 10 years , the payout for flooding was 4.5 billion pounds , whereas in the 10 years before that it was 1.5 billion pounds .
this is hard business evidence of the costs that are being inflicted on our economies and we have to tackle this problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 08.12.2010 ' radiagate ' provokes soul-searching among indian journalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corporate lobbyist niira radia is being questioned by law enforcement agencies leaked recordings of phone conversations with a lobbyist have raised suspicions that some of india 's most influential journalists served as power brokers for a deal that is considered one of india 's biggest scams ever . the revelations have shocked the public and upset the media world .
a controversy involving high-profile journalists and their taped telephone calls has given india its own wikileaks-style storm .
it has been termed the " radiagate " .
india 's own ' mediagate ' top journalists are heard in conversations with influential lobbyist niira radia after the 2009 general elections , discussing who should be in the next cabinet .
radia worked as a lobbyist for two of india 's biggest industrialists : mukesh ambani , head of reliance industries , and ratan tata , whose conglomerate 's interests include phone operator tata teleservices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's former communications and information technology minister a. raja in the taped conversations , niira radia was apparently pushing for a. raja , a south indian politician , to be reinstated as a minister .
as telecom minister before the election , raja had overseen the sale of the lucrative 2g phone licences at rock bottom prices - which is now turning out as potentially one of the biggest corruption cases in indian history .
it is estimated to have cost the exchequer over $ 35 billion in lost revenues .
transcripts of the 104 tapes , many of which have been printed by two news magazines , " open " and " outlook " , have called into question the reputations of , among others , celebrity anchor barkha dutt and veteran newspaper columnist vir sanghvi .
both deny any wrong-doings .
but hartosh singh bahl , the political editor of " open " , points out that there is a larger problem .
" the people who have been caught on tape are by no means the only ones who have been part of this cosy relationship .
this extends far beyond the few journalists who have been named or have been seen on tape .
whether it leads to a larger cleanup in the immediate future , i am not so sure .
there will be a certain sense of caution .
but till journalists as a whole try to organize themselves in a way , enforce a code of ethics in day-to-day work , i am not sure things will change in the long run . "
time for introspection eminent sociologist dipankar gupta agrees that there is a need for serious introspection by the mainstream media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' radiagate ' controversy has caused a heated debate about media ethics " the lesson that the media should learn is that they are really judged in the court of the people .
and what they do must not only seem legal but also proper .
and over the years they have become a little complacent because of their closeness with powerful people , the rich and the powerful . "
the controversy has caused heated debates among journalists , in press clubs and other forums .
" this is a wake-up call because now it is out in the open .
it concerns a few people in the media but unfortunately these people are of high profile .
and i think a large number of people in the media are conscientious regarding their business and this should help them realize what they should not do .
i think sometimes what they should not do is more important than what they should do , " dipankar gupta argues .
the controversy is far from over and could possibly mark a new chapter in indian journalism .

he told deutsche welle that wikileaks unilaterally announced wikileaks.ch as the official domain name last week . wikileaks announced on friday on twitter that its new official domain name was wikileaks.ch , which is owned by the pirate party of switzerland .
like its counterparts around europe , the party stands for reform of copyright law , abolishing the patent system , the right to privacy , and other digital issues . wikileaks.ch forwards to wikileaks ' site , which is currently being hosted in france .
other european domain names , including wikileaks.de for germany , and wikileaks.fi for finland , also point to the new host .
to learn more about the relationship between the swiss pirate party and wikileaks , deutsche welle spoke with denis simonet , the party 's president . deutsche welle : when did you acquire the wikileaks.ch domain name and why did you decide to acquire it ? denis simonet : that was six months ago based on a request from the pirate party of switzerland .
wikileaks is one sign of a problem that has to be solved .
we are for free speech , free media .
the media has to safeguard the media and if they ca n't do it or do n't do it , then our democracy is in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switch , the swiss registrar , told simonet that there is no reason to block wikileaks.ch did you buy the domain as a measure of support for wikileaks , or did wikileaks ask you to do it ? we did so for ourselves .
we do n't host content anyway .
it 's just a re-direction to the servers .
there are many other servers that do the same .
you can just register a domain and forward it .
it 's no big issue .
we did n't ask to do it .
we just did it because a member thought that it was something the pirate party should do to show support . how did you come into contact with wikileaks and with julian assange ? that was a totally different story .
about three or four weeks ago , he announced in the press that he was seeking a request for political asylum in switzerland .
our board decided that because the reason that he has to request asylum is that he is the media spokesperson for wikileaks and that he is in danger now because he is the media spokesperson .
we thought that switzerland could position itself internationally as a place where freedom of media , freedom of opinion and information is of highly considered status .
that 's why i tried to get in contact with julian assange , so we could help him . the help was to inform him about how switzerland works , about how we have a direct democracy , our federal system of cantons .
i explained the political and administrate landscape in switzerland .
that was a big part of the discussion .
he just listened .
he did n't ask for help , he did n't say anything about whether it helps or if he will stay in switzerland or what his future plans are .
he just said " thank you , " and that 's it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange met with simonet in geneva in november what was he like ?
was he at ease ?
did he seem nervous ? he explained to us what the wikileaks philosophy is .
what he 's said in public is what he is .
he was exactly what i expected .
he has a cause and he wants this cause to be known by the world . did you mention that you had the wikileaks.ch domain name ? no , not at all .
wikileaks.ch was n't part of our discussion .
there was no agreement between us .
wikileaks decided unilaterally to communicate wikileaks.ch as the working , official domain name .
the redirection worked for six months and we did n't change anything .
we did n't get a notice .
we just saw the tweet and then the media began to run to us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks continues to be a thorn in the side of many governments around the world have you had any contact with any law enforcement from switzerland , or anywhere else in europe , or the united states ? no .
no one .
and we have n't had any contact with wikileaks , by the way .
we do n't have contact with them anymore , since that meeting . members of the american government have said that they want wikileaks to return the data it has released and to stop its operation .
are you surprised by the government reaction from the technical side ? no .
it 's well-known that sometimes governments do n't really know what they 're talking about when it comes to technical stuff .
that 's why we exist .
no one understands what digital politics means .
we are fighting to improve that situation - we are working to have digital politics for switzerland .
i think that it wo n't help if people know that we have wikileaks.ch , but it will help if we can start discussions about digital politics . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if talks in cancun fail , he will go on with his struggle . just a few weeks ago , chen faqing turned up at the mexican embassy in beijing .
he told the officials there he wanted to donate 250,000 yuan to the climate summit in cancun – with no conditions .
the embassy officials were a little skeptical at first but then the money was transferred – exactly 37,022 dollars and 21 cents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming has an increasing effect on the arctic region with glaciers shrinking chen said it was money well spent : " we only have this world .
some countries are only thinking of economic development and their national interest .
but that will harm all humanity .
protecting the earth has to be a priority . "
chen has already used up a good deal of his savings for his crusade .
he has donated 40,000 us dollars to the secretariat of the intergovernmental panel on climate change in geneva and he has taken out ads in the international press , such as the wall street journal and the economist , too .
" i hope that thanks to my advertisements all the governments will understand what a catastrophe climate change is .
the chinese people 's newspaper refused to print my ad , saying it could lead to diplomatic pressure , " he said .
activism triggered by local water pollution in his adverts , chen presents himself as a disabled farmer although this is only partly true .
however , he is very hard of hearing .
he started off poor but worked his way up – rearing poultry and cattle and making various investments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate during the un climate summit in cancun he first became interested in the environment at the end of the 1990s as more and more people in his village started contracting lung disease .
he was concerned that the rivers were being polluted by the local factories .
for years , chen tried in vain to pressure the local authorities into acting against the pollution .
he then tried to sue them ; then he tried to sue the environment ministry in beijing , and even prime minister wen jiabao but all in vain .
everybody has to work together " the government has to bear more responsibility regarding greenhouse gases .
the world will only be saved if everybody does something , " he insisted .
he said he refused to give up his fight , even if no deal was reached in cancun : " next year , i will continue taking out adverts in the international media and i will donate money to support further climate talks . "
the mexican government had arranged for chen to be present in cancun , like all big donors but he refused .
he says he ca n't speak english .
moreover , he was urgently needed at home in his village – his wife had hoped he would spend his life savings on building a new house , not on saving the planet .

he faces charges of manslaughter and robbery .
the controversial trial will shine a spotlight on turkey 's legal system . nearly 20 years after fleeing to germany from his native turkey , author dogan akhanli has gone before an istanbul courtroom on wednesday facing charges of robbery and manslaughter .
the 53-year-old akhanli , who has lived in germany since 1991 and holds german citizenship , is charged with involvement in an armed robbery at a currency exchange office in istanbul in 1989 .
his lawyers told the court they would seek an acquittal for their client , who , they said , had been blackmailed under torture and was the subject of a fabricated case .
a delegation of akhanli 's supporters has traveled to istanbul for the trial , among them german author guenter wallraff , who said earlier wednesday that akhanli had revoked statements allegedly given under torture .
" if due process is considered here , he must be released .
and i expect this to happen , " wallraff said .
" he is a colleague who has been innocently arrested . "
his publisher regip zarakoglu , meanwhile , said " they couldn ’ t punish akhanli for his writings , so they ’ re trying to pin another crime on him . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff called for akhanli 's immediate release germany 's foreign ministry is also expected to be closely watching the trial .
akhanli is receiving consular assistance , and the ministry is in contact with lawyers in cologne and istanbul , according to a spokesperson .
author 's perspective akhanli said earlier through his lawyer : " if i wasn ’ t being threatened with a life sentence , i ’ d have to laugh about my situation .
i feel like franz kafka ’ s tragic-hero josef k. , and not just because i ’ ve been arrested even though i ’ m innocent . "
the cologne-based political author was arrested on august 10 after returning to turkey for the first time since his escape to visit his ailing father who later died at the end of november without seeing his son .
since august , akhanli has been held in a prison in the province of tekirdag .
following his arrest , akhanli was also charged with a political offense , as prosecutors have said the crime was part of a move to destabilize the constitutional order in the country .
if convicted , he faces life in prison .
akhanli 's lawyer haydar erol has claimed the criminal charges are based on witness statements that were either fabricated or obtained through torture .
he said one witness , the son of the exchange office owner killed during the robbery , later disputed ever having identified akhanli in a photograph .
in addition , erol said akhanli 's fingerprints were never found at the scene .
" the scenario was produced by the police , " erol told german press agency dpa in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armenian massacre during world war i left few survivors a belated settling of accounts erol said the author 's arrest was a belated settling of accounts with the political left .
he has called for akhanli 's release and for the legal proceedings to be discontinued .
after the turkish military coup in 1980 , akhanli went underground and was arrested four years later for being a member of the revolutionary communist party of turkey -lrb- tdkp -rrb- .
he was imprisoned from 1985 to 1987 , during which time he said he was tortured .
living in cologne for the past two decades , akhanli , who has won awards in turkey and germany for his writing , has worked with the research association recherche international to uncover and study the genocides of the last century , in particular the ottoman empire 's massacre of armenians during world war i. his work has led some to believe he was targeted for writing on the topic .
it remains a sensitive subject in turkey , which has refused to classify the event as genocide .
' no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has refused to classify the armenian massacre as genocide akhanli 's arrest has led to demonstrations in germany and his supporters , among them amnesty international , fellow authors , intellectuals and politicians , plan to follow the trial closely .
" there is no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody , " said selami guerel , a friend and supporter .
" we expect that he will be released after the first day in court . "
the berlin academy of arts has called for international protests against akhanli 's arrest , and along with various european human rights organization and legal associations has demanded " freedom and justice .

a new unicef report finds that most kids attach great importance to family cohesion , friendship and trust . a survey compiled on behalf of unicef and officially released in berlin on wednesday takes a closer look at which social values six to 14-year-old kids in germany cherish the most . information gathered in 1,500 interviews has led the authors of the study to conclude that the vast majority of children are very highly value-oriented .
" we do n't see any decline in values in this age group as some scientists want to make us believe , " said professor hans bertram from berlin 's humboldt university during the presentation of the survey .
" values such as mutual trust , and increasingly also respect for other people 's opinions and life experiences , are extremely important for children here . "
family as a safe haven bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german children 's values are not declining , says the unicef team other qualities that rank high in the value system of the young are reliability , a sense of belonging , and honesty .
far less important for those polled appear to be money and religious faith .
but what counts most for children is family cohesion , the study says .
" of course , many kids do have problems with their parents once in a while , " said gerd bruene from the geo publishing house which was involved in the survey .
" but the kids want to feel safe and protected , and they clearly associate this with their families . "
working parents are not a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when parents are away , the children can play the study also reveals that most children here have learned to deal with the fact that many parents – increasingly also mothers – have to stay away from home for a long period to pursue their jobs .
but they enjoy the time they can spend together with their parents who are credited with largely keeping job-related problems away from the kids .
" the kids feel that there 's often a lack of time for working mothers to spend with them , " said sociologist hans bertram .
" but many youngsters also feel they have more freedom to pursue their own activities while their mothers are away . "
german children fully accept the primary role of both parents and teachers to instill values of social behavior in them . only a small proportion would make use of the media for this , and even fewer care about what religious leaders or politicians tell them .

the 54-year old , who has dedicated his life to the fight for more civil rights in china , has been declared an enemy of the state . liu xiaobo has been known as one of the most prominent critics of the chinese regime for decades .
the civil rights activist has been in jail for nearly two years now .
this is not the first time that he has been locked up - the first time was after the bloody crackdown on the chinese democracy movement in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1989 : a student blocks a line of tanks near tiananmen square " i was on my bike home .
it was about midnight .
a car was following me and forced me to stop .
a couple of people came out , " liu recalled in a 2007 interview with deutsche welle .
" they blindfolded me , tied me up and pushed me into the car .
i was really scared .
i thought that they would take me somewhere and just shoot me . "
' duty ' to fight for justice liu xiaobo , who had studied literature , had taken the side of the chinese students fighting for more democracy on tiananmen square in 1989 .
after two years in jail , his will to fight was still not broken .
again , he was detained in 1995 and 1996 .
but he continued the struggle , explaining , " many innocent people were killed during the tiananmen massacre .
i believe that it is my duty to fight for justice to those who gave their lives .
it is a duty that i can not abandon , " he said .
charter ' 08 in late 2008 , liu xiaobo was arrested once more .
he had been one of the main initiators of the so-called ' charter ' 08 ' manifesto , which was published on the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights . the manifesto called for political reforms in china , including a system of checks and balances , freedom of speech and a competitive multi-party democracy .
as many as ten thousand intellectuals and academics have signed the petition so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo 's wife liu xia is under constant surveillance " many in his position would have given up .
but xiaobo has the mental strength .
if he believes in a goal , he 'll try to reach that goal by all means , even if he knows that he will never be able to reach it , " liu xia , his wife , had said in an interview .
" he can be really stubborn . "
she had had an uneasy feeling and sensed that the communist party would let her husband pay dearly for the charter ' 08 .
sentenced for ' subversion ' in december 2009 , a chinese court sentenced liu xiaobo to eleven years in jail on subversion charges .
in 2007 , he had already anticipated what could happen to him .
" i ’ ve once said that it is a dissident ’ s professional hazard to lose his freedom and being under surveillance .
it is part of a dissident ’ s job , " he told deutsche welle .
" it is your own choice .
you can do other things , be a salesman or a teacher , and earn easy money .
but as soon as you decide to be a dissident , you should withstand pressure with optimism , self-confidence and composure . "
committee defies china liu xiaobo is serving his sentence in a detention facility 500 kilometers northeast of beijing .
once a month he is allowed to receive visitors .
the chinese authorities have harshly protested against the pro-democracy activist receiving the nobel peace prize .
the executive secretary of the norwegian nobel committee geir lundestad reported that the chinese government explicitly threatened the committee not to give the prize to liu .
the decision would have a negative impact on chinese-norwegian relations , beijing said .
bildunterschrift : liu has been sentenced to eleven years in prison for ' subversive ' activities liu had also anticipated this kind of a move : " some european politicians fear that a discussion about human rights can have a negative impact on their economic relations with china .
i don ’ t think so .
the political relationship between china and japan is full of tensions .
but china 's trade relations with japan are among the largest with any country .
so you can see that both these two things do not have anything to do with each other . "

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 08.12.2010 study reveals nearly all european children are not bothered by what they find online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study examined 23,000 children across europe the final results of a europe-wide study of children 's behavior online are presented in berlin .
researchers suggest children might be able to help their parents learn how to use the internet more effectively . on tuesday , the findings of a europe-wide study on young people and the internet were released in berlin .
more than 23,000 children and young people between the ages of nine and 16 were interviewed across 25 european countries .
the preliminary results of the study had been released in october .
according to the research , 12 percent of the young people interviewed said they were bothered or upset by something on the internet - which is a much lower number than the researchers expected .
surprisingly the top activity young people use the internet for is homework , closely followed by entertainment and games and communication .
klaus neumann-braun , a professor at the institute for media science at the university of basel in switzerland , noted that this study should go some way towards allaying the hysteria that accompanies many discussions around young people and the internet .
in germany young people spend 50 precent of their time communicating with their friends on the internet - creating their online profile , messaging friends and so on .
a window to the outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuelervz.net remains a very popular social networking site in germany amongst school-age kids uwe hasebrink , chairman of the german part of the eu kids online network and director of the hans bredow institute for media research in hamburg said that young people have really embraced social networking sites , which has become an important part in social development and establishing their identities .
" they have to develop their position in the societal structure .
they have to come to know people .
they have to have experiences with others .
they have to build their identity , " he said , and added that for all these factors " the social web provides enormous possibilities " .
many young people are also increasingly resourceful in their use of the internet to solve everyday problems .
hasebrink described the situation of an 11-year-old afghan girl living in germany with her family that has strict cultural values .
" this girl told us that she writes a diary in a social networking site .
it is completely protected by a password .
she is the only person who can access her profile on this social networking site - nobody else - no friends " explained hasebrink .
he went on to say that the girl 's two older brothers keep a close watch over her and try to steer her away from the so-called " decadent western lifestyle , " and that her only chance to express her innermost thoughts is online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 48 percent of kids surveyed said they did not know how to change the privacy settings on sites like facebook but not every child is quite so media literate and innovative . the study also showed that 48 percent of young people do n't know how to change the privacy settings on their social networking profile , and 40 percent do n't know how to block messages from people they do n't want to have contact with .
cyberbullying threat remains low while the study found on average across the eu that bullying in real life was more prevalent than online , the polish data results surprised agnieszka wrzesien , project coordinator of the safer internet project in poland .
in the eu kids online study , five percent of polish kids reported that they had experienced cyberbullying , however the polish helpline has different figures .
they have reported yearly increases and in 2010 received 800 reports in 11 months .
wrzesien said that perhaps one reason for the discrepancy was a fear that if kids in poland mentioned cyberbullying , their parents might find out and restrict their internet or mobile phone access .
most social networking sites in poland have implemented a reporting mechanism , an abuse button , that allows children and young people to report if something bad is happening to them online .
however wrzesien said that even if they report it , this kind of problem takes time to resolve .
" within those couple of hours that the pictures may stay online , people may download them , may share them , they can be forwarded to other colleagues outside school and so on and this is a very distressing experience , " she said .
future policy recommendations in poland , wrzesien is working hard with schools and teachers in order to set up a system to prevent cyberbullying and to teach them how to respond to these incidents .
this system " would involve police , isp 's , psychologists and parents because it often happens that there needs to be police involved because the incident was so serious " , said wrzesien .
the german youth hotline called nummergegenkummer received over 20,000 calls in 2009 from kids who were having problems online .
beate friese from nummergegenkummer said that a big part of their work is teaching kids skills to resolve the problems themselves .
they also train young people to counsel other young people about problems they encounter online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study found that kids might be able to teach their parents , too parents need help , too but it 's not only kids that need help .
the study also highlights the fact that parents often have no idea what their kids are up to on the internet and do n't know how to help them if they have a problem .
some european authorities say that this problem could be alleviated if children teach their parents .
" -lsb- that will -rsb- not only bridge the gap in terms of technology , but will give them the opportunity to spend some time with their kids , " said dr. yiannis laouris , the head of the cyprus neuroscience & technology institute .
others , like uwe hasebrink , from hamburg , are calling for social networking sites to make the default setting for a user profile private .
that way , anyone can choose what he or she wants to make public .
hasebrink said that these initial findings will inform the researchers ' next steps which will be to work on correlational analysis and testing concrete hypothesis .
" so to what extent is risk experience or harm experience correlated with parental mediation ? " he said . " what is the role of school ?
what is the role of peers ?
what is the role of psychological factors ? are children generally looking for sensation ?
do they always want to have action ? "

the row has been brewing since monday , when germany flatly rejected on legal and economic grounds a proposal by juncker for joint eurozone bonds .
in an article to be published thursday in german weekly die zeit , juncker labeled the german reaction as " un-european , " and attacked the government of chancellor angela merkel for not taking a proper look at his proposal - aimed at helping weaker eurozone countries like greece , ireland and portugal raise money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says germany is being un-european " they are rejecting an idea before studying it ...
this way of creating taboo areas in europe and not dealing with others ' ideas is a very un-european way of dealing with european matters , " said juncker , who is also luxembourg 's prime minister .
" germany is thinking a bit simple on that , " he added .
the joint bonds - or e-bonds - could help eurozone members seen as having unstable public finances lower their borrowing costs .
as it stands , the interest that weaker eurozone states must pay out on government bonds stands at more than double - and sometimes triple - the interest paid by stronger members , such as germany .
it is believed such high interest rates for irish and greek bonds contributed to both countries having to seek huge loans from the eu and international monetary fund recently - 110 billion euros and 85 billion euros respectively .
german reaction merkel retorted to juncker 's comments on his e-bond proposal by saying his words were causing unease on world markets .
the yield on a 10-year german government bond recently shot up to 3 percent from 2.4 percent in early november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says juncker 's comments are causing market instability " it does n't help anyone in europe if european figures call each other un-european , " commented merkel 's spokesman steffen seibert in a regular government briefing .
" it is exactly this talking against other people and about other people which should stop , because the markets definitely see this finger-pointing as a sign of discord . "
" the german government remains opposed to the proposal .
the legal and economic concerns about the euro bonds will remain in place for the weeks ahead , " he added .
merkel herself called for " calm " ahead of an eu leaders ' summit next friday , where talks will focus on creating a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone and what the chancellor called " narrow " changes to eu treaties .
" i think that we should work in a calm and goal-oriented manner towards what awaits us next friday .
this calm manner is my contribution to making sure we are successful next friday , " merkel told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 08.12.2010 a new elite for afghanistan - made in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students are among the most talented in afghanistan talented afghan students are coming to erfurt to learn about public policy .
they hope to go back to their country armed with the skills to take up leading positions in ministries or in non-governmental organizations . since 2008 , a number of young afghans have been coming to study at the willy brandt school of public policy at the university of erfurt in central germany .
they learn how to govern countries effectively .
the students have an ambitious goal : to build a peaceful , democratic state in afghanistan , and to rid the country of terror and violence .
in the future , these students hope to form the afghan elite , to find jobs in government ministries or ngos .
after a six-month preparatory program entitled " good governance in afghanistan , " the students are ready to begin a masters course in public policy .
high hopes and clear ambitions moheb jarbakhail is one of 27 young afghans at the willy brandt school .
the 25-year-old says he wants to return to kabul at the end of his course , armed with skills he has learned .
" people like myself can make a significant difference to afghanistan for two reasons , " moheb told deutsche welle .
" one , we get all the academic knowledge of how to govern a society , and the second is : we are from that country , we understand the internal politics .
so , i see my future in helping the afghan public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez wants to help afghan women moheb has been studying in erfurt for almost a year .
before that , he completed a degree in economics at the university of kabul , studied in the us and also worked for an aid organization in afghanistan .
one of only five women on the course is 23 year-old hajar mobarez .
she already knows what women can achieve in afghanistan .
her mother is a member of parliament in kabul .
over the summer holidays , hajar helped her with the election campaign .
the women drove round remote villages , distributing campaign leaflets .
" i want to work for the government , especially in the area of economic development , " hajar said .
" i also want to work for empowering women through providing more educational opportunities . "
can western democracy work in afghanistan ?
a lecturer on the course , kristina roepstorff , has had endless debates with her students , about whether western-style democracy can function in countries like afghanistan .
" some of them strongly rejected the idea of democracy at first , " roepstoff said .
" over time they 've learnt that there are various types of democracy .
they can see it 's a system that makes sense , and that could settle ethnic conflicts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frangis spanta is looking for the best applicants the course is partly financed by the german foreign ministry , and the students also get a grant from the german academic exchange sercive -lrb- daad -rrb- .
frangis spanta , the daughter of a former afghan foreign minister coordinates the masters program .
she 's received 120 applications for next year 's course , although there are just 10 places .
applicants need to bring with them excellent marks , a strong knowledge of english , and political experience .
however not every afghan politician is behind the idea of the germans forging their elite .
" on a political level of course some of the ministries are skeptical , " spanta said .
" they say : ' ok , they 're being trained over there .
but can they really use what they 've learned in germany ? '
the thing is though , afghanistan needs these capabilities . "
hope of the nation in some senses , the young afghans are carrying the weight of their home country on their shoulders .
moheb jarbakhail feels the pressure , but is ambitious and hopeful about the future : " i would like to succeed , " he said .
" i would like to use this opportunity that is given to me to be a knowledgeable person and that pressure is from within and that is one of the motivations that has brought me here to germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez with her german guest parents the students learn all about german culture from their guest parents and at the same time , are motivated by the idea of creating a more positive image of their country .
" i wish that whenever everyone asks me : ‘ where do you come from ? '
i proudly say : ‘ i am from afghanistan , " ' said hajar mobarez .

the commission said wednesday it would delay the cancellation of subsidies until 2018 . germany has won concessions from the european union on coal subsidies paid out to loss-making mines .
the eu commission said wednesday it would push back a phase-out date on subsidies by four years to 2018 .
the commission had said in july that failing mines would have to be closed by 2014 , arguing that subsidies were bad for the environment and promoted unfair competition .
but germany fiercely protested , saying that the subsidies kept its coal industry afloat , and that a 2014 phase-out would endanger too many jobs .
job security for some 25,000 workers employed at five mines around germany would have been threatened by a 2014 deadline .
berlin welcomed the commission 's decision as " a great success , " government spokesman steffen seibert said wednesday .
the extension of coal subsidies to 2018 would enable germany to meet its social obligations to the country 's miners , he added .
the premier of germany 's saarland state , which is home to one of the country 's largest mines , welcomed the eu decision to yield to german pressure .
peter mueller said the continuation of subsidies until 2018 was a " socially acceptable solution for miners without redundancy deals . "
the four-year moratorium on mine closures should also be long enough to allow germany to restructure its coal industry without sustaining considerable losses .
of the 26 other eu member states , only romania and spain will be directly affected by the new subsidies deadline .
the deal is to set to be endorsed by eu competition ministers on friday .
environmental group greenpeace 's energy policy expert , frauke thies , said that in 2008 the german government had subsidized each individual job in unprofitable coal mines to the tune of 235,000 euros -lrb- $ 311,000 -rrb- .

berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .

a new unicef report finds that most kids attach great importance to family cohesion , friendship and trust . a survey compiled on behalf of unicef and officially released in berlin on wednesday takes a closer look at which social values six to 14-year-old kids in germany cherish the most . information gathered in 1,500 interviews has led the authors of the study to conclude that the vast majority of children are very highly value-oriented .
" we do n't see any decline in values in this age group as some scientists want to make us believe , " said professor hans bertram from berlin 's humboldt university during the presentation of the survey .
" values such as mutual trust , and increasingly also respect for other people 's opinions and life experiences , are extremely important for children here . "
family as a safe haven bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german children 's values are not declining , says the unicef team other qualities that rank high in the value system of the young are reliability , a sense of belonging , and honesty .
far less important for those polled appear to be money and religious faith .
but what counts most for children is family cohesion , the study says .
" of course , many kids do have problems with their parents once in a while , " said gerd bruene from the geo publishing house which was involved in the survey .
" but the kids want to feel safe and protected , and they clearly associate this with their families . "
working parents are not a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when parents are away , the children can play the study also reveals that most children here have learned to deal with the fact that many parents – increasingly also mothers – have to stay away from home for a long period to pursue their jobs .
but they enjoy the time they can spend together with their parents who are credited with largely keeping job-related problems away from the kids .
" the kids feel that there 's often a lack of time for working mothers to spend with them , " said sociologist hans bertram .
" but many youngsters also feel they have more freedom to pursue their own activities while their mothers are away . "
german children fully accept the primary role of both parents and teachers to instill values of social behavior in them . only a small proportion would make use of the media for this , and even fewer care about what religious leaders or politicians tell them .

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.12.2010 german children have a healthy value system , unicef says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harmony in the family is what german kids value most contrary to popular belief , children in germany have a high appreciation of social values .
a new unicef report finds that most kids attach great importance to family cohesion , friendship and trust . a survey compiled on behalf of unicef and officially released in berlin on wednesday takes a closer look at which social values six to 14-year-old kids in germany cherish the most . information gathered in 1,500 interviews has led the authors of the study to conclude that the vast majority of children are very highly value-oriented .
" we do n't see any decline in values in this age group as some scientists want to make us believe , " said professor hans bertram from berlin 's humboldt university during the presentation of the survey .
" values such as mutual trust , and increasingly also respect for other people 's opinions and life experiences , are extremely important for children here . "
family as a safe haven bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german children 's values are not declining , says the unicef team other qualities that rank high in the value system of the young are reliability , a sense of belonging , and honesty .
far less important for those polled appear to be money and religious faith .
but what counts most for children is family cohesion , the study says .
" of course , many kids do have problems with their parents once in a while , " said gerd bruene from the geo publishing house which was involved in the survey .
" but the kids want to feel safe and protected , and they clearly associate this with their families . "
working parents are not a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when parents are away , the children can play the study also reveals that most children here have learned to deal with the fact that many parents – increasingly also mothers – have to stay away from home for a long period to pursue their jobs .
but they enjoy the time they can spend together with their parents who are credited with largely keeping job-related problems away from the kids .
" the kids feel that there 's often a lack of time for working mothers to spend with them , " said sociologist hans bertram .
" but many youngsters also feel they have more freedom to pursue their own activities while their mothers are away . "
german children fully accept the primary role of both parents and teachers to instill values of social behavior in them . only a small proportion would make use of the media for this , and even fewer care about what religious leaders or politicians tell them .

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

a new unicef report finds that most kids attach great importance to family cohesion , friendship and trust . a survey compiled on behalf of unicef and officially released in berlin on wednesday takes a closer look at which social values six to 14-year-old kids in germany cherish the most . information gathered in 1,500 interviews has led the authors of the study to conclude that the vast majority of children are very highly value-oriented .
" we do n't see any decline in values in this age group as some scientists want to make us believe , " said professor hans bertram from berlin 's humboldt university during the presentation of the survey .
" values such as mutual trust , and increasingly also respect for other people 's opinions and life experiences , are extremely important for children here . "

far less important for those polled appear to be money and religious faith .
but what counts most for children is family cohesion , the study says .
" of course , many kids do have problems with their parents once in a while , " said gerd bruene from the geo publishing house which was involved in the survey .
" but the kids want to feel safe and protected , and they clearly associate this with their families . "
working parents are not a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when parents are away , the children can play the study also reveals that most children here have learned to deal with the fact that many parents – increasingly also mothers – have to stay away from home for a long period to pursue their jobs .
but they enjoy the time they can spend together with their parents who are credited with largely keeping job-related problems away from the kids .
" the kids feel that there 's often a lack of time for working mothers to spend with them , " said sociologist hans bertram .
" but many youngsters also feel they have more freedom to pursue their own activities while their mothers are away . "
german children fully accept the primary role of both parents and teachers to instill values of social behavior in them . only a small proportion would make use of the media for this , and even fewer care about what religious leaders or politicians tell them .

they hope to go back to their country armed with the skills to take up leading positions in ministries or in non-governmental organizations . since 2008 , a number of young afghans have been coming to study at the willy brandt school of public policy at the university of erfurt in central germany .
they learn how to govern countries effectively .
the students have an ambitious goal : to build a peaceful , democratic state in afghanistan , and to rid the country of terror and violence .
in the future , these students hope to form the afghan elite , to find jobs in government ministries or ngos .
after a six-month preparatory program entitled " good governance in afghanistan , " the students are ready to begin a masters course in public policy .
high hopes and clear ambitions moheb jarbakhail is one of 27 young afghans at the willy brandt school .
the 25-year-old says he wants to return to kabul at the end of his course , armed with skills he has learned .
" people like myself can make a significant difference to afghanistan for two reasons , " moheb told deutsche welle .
" one , we get all the academic knowledge of how to govern a society , and the second is : we are from that country , we understand the internal politics .
so , i see my future in helping the afghan public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez wants to help afghan women moheb has been studying in erfurt for almost a year .
before that , he completed a degree in economics at the university of kabul , studied in the us and also worked for an aid organization in afghanistan .
one of only five women on the course is 23 year-old hajar mobarez .
she already knows what women can achieve in afghanistan .
her mother is a member of parliament in kabul .
over the summer holidays , hajar helped her with the election campaign .
the women drove round remote villages , distributing campaign leaflets .
" i want to work for the government , especially in the area of economic development , " hajar said .
" i also want to work for empowering women through providing more educational opportunities . "
can western democracy work in afghanistan ?
a lecturer on the course , kristina roepstorff , has had endless debates with her students , about whether western-style democracy can function in countries like afghanistan .
" some of them strongly rejected the idea of democracy at first , " roepstoff said .
" over time they 've learnt that there are various types of democracy .
they can see it 's a system that makes sense , and that could settle ethnic conflicts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frangis spanta is looking for the best applicants the course is partly financed by the german foreign ministry , and the students also get a grant from the german academic exchange sercive -lrb- daad -rrb- .
frangis spanta , the daughter of a former afghan foreign minister coordinates the masters program .
she 's received 120 applications for next year 's course , although there are just 10 places .
applicants need to bring with them excellent marks , a strong knowledge of english , and political experience .
however not every afghan politician is behind the idea of the germans forging their elite .
" on a political level of course some of the ministries are skeptical , " spanta said .
" they say : ' ok , they 're being trained over there .
but can they really use what they 've learned in germany ? '
the thing is though , afghanistan needs these capabilities . "
hope of the nation in some senses , the young afghans are carrying the weight of their home country on their shoulders .
moheb jarbakhail feels the pressure , but is ambitious and hopeful about the future : " i would like to succeed , " he said .
" i would like to use this opportunity that is given to me to be a knowledgeable person and that pressure is from within and that is one of the motivations that has brought me here to germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez with her german guest parents the students learn all about german culture from their guest parents and at the same time , are motivated by the idea of creating a more positive image of their country .

i proudly say : ‘ i am from afghanistan , " ' said hajar mobarez .

the 25-year-old says he wants to return to kabul at the end of his course , armed with skills he has learned .
" people like myself can make a significant difference to afghanistan for two reasons , " moheb told deutsche welle .
" one , we get all the academic knowledge of how to govern a society , and the second is : we are from that country , we understand the internal politics .
so , i see my future in helping the afghan public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez wants to help afghan women moheb has been studying in erfurt for almost a year .
before that , he completed a degree in economics at the university of kabul , studied in the us and also worked for an aid organization in afghanistan .
one of only five women on the course is 23 year-old hajar mobarez .
she already knows what women can achieve in afghanistan .
her mother is a member of parliament in kabul .
over the summer holidays , hajar helped her with the election campaign .
the women drove round remote villages , distributing campaign leaflets .
" i want to work for the government , especially in the area of economic development , " hajar said .
" i also want to work for empowering women through providing more educational opportunities . "
can western democracy work in afghanistan ?
a lecturer on the course , kristina roepstorff , has had endless debates with her students , about whether western-style democracy can function in countries like afghanistan .
" some of them strongly rejected the idea of democracy at first , " roepstoff said .
" over time they 've learnt that there are various types of democracy .
they can see it 's a system that makes sense , and that could settle ethnic conflicts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frangis spanta is looking for the best applicants the course is partly financed by the german foreign ministry , and the students also get a grant from the german academic exchange sercive -lrb- daad -rrb- .
frangis spanta , the daughter of a former afghan foreign minister coordinates the masters program .
she 's received 120 applications for next year 's course , although there are just 10 places .
applicants need to bring with them excellent marks , a strong knowledge of english , and political experience .
however not every afghan politician is behind the idea of the germans forging their elite .
" on a political level of course some of the ministries are skeptical , " spanta said .
" they say : ' ok , they 're being trained over there .
but can they really use what they 've learned in germany ? '
the thing is though , afghanistan needs these capabilities . "
hope of the nation in some senses , the young afghans are carrying the weight of their home country on their shoulders .
moheb jarbakhail feels the pressure , but is ambitious and hopeful about the future : " i would like to succeed , " he said .
" i would like to use this opportunity that is given to me to be a knowledgeable person and that pressure is from within and that is one of the motivations that has brought me here to germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez with her german guest parents the students learn all about german culture from their guest parents and at the same time , are motivated by the idea of creating a more positive image of their country .
" i wish that whenever everyone asks me : ‘ where do you come from ? '
i proudly say : ‘ i am from afghanistan , " ' said hajar mobarez .

he faces charges of manslaughter and robbery .
the controversial trial will shine a spotlight on turkey 's legal system . nearly 20 years after fleeing to germany from his native turkey , author dogan akhanli has gone before an istanbul courtroom on wednesday facing charges of robbery and manslaughter .
the 53-year-old akhanli , who has lived in germany since 1991 and holds german citizenship , is charged with involvement in an armed robbery at a currency exchange office in istanbul in 1989 .
his lawyers told the court they would seek an acquittal for their client , who , they said , had been blackmailed under torture and was the subject of a fabricated case .
a delegation of akhanli 's supporters has traveled to istanbul for the trial , among them german author guenter wallraff , who said earlier wednesday that akhanli had revoked statements allegedly given under torture .
" if due process is considered here , he must be released .
and i expect this to happen , " wallraff said .
" he is a colleague who has been innocently arrested . "
his publisher regip zarakoglu , meanwhile , said " they couldn ’ t punish akhanli for his writings , so they ’ re trying to pin another crime on him . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff called for akhanli 's immediate release germany 's foreign ministry is also expected to be closely watching the trial .
akhanli is receiving consular assistance , and the ministry is in contact with lawyers in cologne and istanbul , according to a spokesperson .
author 's perspective akhanli said earlier through his lawyer : " if i wasn ’ t being threatened with a life sentence , i ’ d have to laugh about my situation .
i feel like franz kafka ’ s tragic-hero josef k. , and not just because i ’ ve been arrested even though i ’ m innocent . "
the cologne-based political author was arrested on august 10 after returning to turkey for the first time since his escape to visit his ailing father who later died at the end of november without seeing his son .
since august , akhanli has been held in a prison in the province of tekirdag .
following his arrest , akhanli was also charged with a political offense , as prosecutors have said the crime was part of a move to destabilize the constitutional order in the country .
if convicted , he faces life in prison .
akhanli 's lawyer haydar erol has claimed the criminal charges are based on witness statements that were either fabricated or obtained through torture .
he said one witness , the son of the exchange office owner killed during the robbery , later disputed ever having identified akhanli in a photograph .
in addition , erol said akhanli 's fingerprints were never found at the scene .
" the scenario was produced by the police , " erol told german press agency dpa in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armenian massacre during world war i left few survivors a belated settling of accounts erol said the author 's arrest was a belated settling of accounts with the political left .
he has called for akhanli 's release and for the legal proceedings to be discontinued .
after the turkish military coup in 1980 , akhanli went underground and was arrested four years later for being a member of the revolutionary communist party of turkey -lrb- tdkp -rrb- .
he was imprisoned from 1985 to 1987 , during which time he said he was tortured .
living in cologne for the past two decades , akhanli , who has won awards in turkey and germany for his writing , has worked with the research association recherche international to uncover and study the genocides of the last century , in particular the ottoman empire 's massacre of armenians during world war i. his work has led some to believe he was targeted for writing on the topic .
it remains a sensitive subject in turkey , which has refused to classify the event as genocide .
' no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has refused to classify the armenian massacre as genocide akhanli 's arrest has led to demonstrations in germany and his supporters , among them amnesty international , fellow authors , intellectuals and politicians , plan to follow the trial closely .
" there is no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody , " said selami guerel , a friend and supporter .
" we expect that he will be released after the first day in court . "
the berlin academy of arts has called for international protests against akhanli 's arrest , and along with various european human rights organization and legal associations has demanded " freedom and justice .

the new law is supposed to make it harder for tax dodgers to admit their crimes themselves , thus avoiding a trial . the german cabinet on wednesday finalized new draft legislation on tax evasion , as it attempts to close some of the loop holes that allow tax dodgers to avoid prosecution once authorities get wind of their misdemeanors .
the draft bill by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble would make it more difficult for offenders to dodge legal proceedings by preemptively admitting their guilt and paying back taxes .
under current german law , people can avoid a trial by issuing a so-called " voluntary disclosure , " detailing the taxes they have skipped and paying them with 6 percent interest - provided they do so before they are officially prosecuted .
tax evaders can still file a voluntary disclosure after being notified that their assets are under investigation , but the deadline would change under the proposed legislation , meaning that once you have been warned , it 's too late to confess .
" these prosecution-avoiding voluntary disclosures will therefore no longer be effective as part of a calculated tax evasion strategy , " the financial policy spokesman for the christian democratic union , leo dautzenberg , said in an interview with the newspaper die welt .
some german tax dodgers have been abusing this legal loop hole by deliberately waiting until they received their pro-forma warning , and then declaring their assets .
full disclosure the new draft law would also make voluntary disclosures valid only if tax dodgers comprehensively admit to all the assets they have failed to declare that have not become legally outdated .
" people submitting voluntary disclosures will only be immune to proseuction if they completely and accurately disclose information on all assets that qualify for any form of tax , " a government statement says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent government purchase of stolen bank data prompted the debate but of course , the tax authorities would first have to find any withheld funds or assets in order to make a case .
germany recently registered a wave of almost 30,000 voluntary admissions after purchasing cds containing stolen data on foreign bank accounts held by german citizens , as people realized the information might incriminate them .
" our experiences with the flood of voluntary disclosures after the debate over the purchase of tax data highlighted the need to change our legal system and limit the ways in which tax evaders can avoid prosecution , " the budgetary and financial spokesman for the christian social union , bartholomaeus kalb , told parliament on wednesday .
too little , too late ?
however , the proposed changes would represent only a slight tightening of germany 's already lax tax evasion laws , and critics have derided the draft law as a " mini-solution " by a center-right coalition government that does n't want to get too tough on the subject .
" the coalition has become nervous because of the public outcry over the case of the swiss bank data cds , " the chairman of the german union of tax workers , dieter ondracek , told deutsche welle .
" that made ordinary citizens aware of the possibility of submitting a voluntary disclosure , and they were unhappy with the law . "
" the politicians do n't really want to address the issue , because they see revenue from these disclosures as money in the bank , without any messy litigation . "
ondracek , however , believes that it would be better to get rid of voluntary disclosures altogether , arguing the german approach to tax evasion implies that it 's not really considered a crime .
" it 's not just important , it 's a matter of urgency , " ondracek said .
" this possibility only exists for one crime - tax evasion .
how can a crime be serious if you can absolve yourself of legal responsibility at the last minute just by owning up ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister schaeuble could do with the extra cash " in reality , tax evasion is comparable with embezzlement or theft , except you 're not stealing from one person , you 're stealing from every german citizen .
remember , this is a problem that costs our government and taxpayers an absolute minimum of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.2 billion -rrb- per year . "
wasted chance to tackle the deficit ?
that 10 billion euro bottom estimate would represent just under one fifth of the money the heavily indebted german government plans to borrow in 2011 .
missing taxes do not become legally out-dated for 10 years , meaning that german tax dodgers currently owe at least 100 billion euros .
" it would make more sense to try to balance the budget by doing everything we can to secure these missing taxes that people are legally obliged to pay the government , " ondracek said .
" instead , we 're taking out more loans and passing on the interest to our grandchildren . "
the opposition social democrats had also advocated abolishing the voluntary disclosure system altogether , in favor of letting the courts decide whether or not tax evaders deserved to avoid jail sentences or other legal punishments .
" the legal procedure involving voluntary disclosures has existed in germany for 90 years now , " kalb of the christian social union countered .
" it has proved its worth and remains a useful mechanism .
abolishing this system , as per the -lsb- social democrats ' -rsb- suggestion , would be unwise . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister schaeuble could do with the extra cash " in reality , tax evasion is comparable with embezzlement or theft , except you 're not stealing from one person , you 're stealing from every german citizen .
remember , this is a problem that costs our government and taxpayers an absolute minimum of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.2 billion -rrb- per year . "
wasted chance to tackle the deficit ?
that 10 billion euro bottom estimate would represent just under one fifth of the money the heavily indebted german government plans to borrow in 2011 .
missing taxes do not become legally out-dated for 10 years , meaning that german tax dodgers currently owe at least 100 billion euros .
" it would make more sense to try to balance the budget by doing everything we can to secure these missing taxes that people are legally obliged to pay the government , " ondracek said .
" instead , we 're taking out more loans and passing on the interest to our grandchildren . "
the opposition social democrats had also advocated abolishing the voluntary disclosure system altogether , in favor of letting the courts decide whether or not tax evaders deserved to avoid jail sentences or other legal punishments .
" the legal procedure involving voluntary disclosures has existed in germany for 90 years now , " kalb of the christian social union countered .
" it has proved its worth and remains a useful mechanism .
abolishing this system , as per the -lsb- social democrats ' -rsb- suggestion , would be unwise . "

the commission said wednesday it would delay the cancellation of subsidies until 2018 . germany has won concessions from the european union on coal subsidies paid out to loss-making mines .
the eu commission said wednesday it would push back a phase-out date on subsidies by four years to 2018 .
the commission had said in july that failing mines would have to be closed by 2014 , arguing that subsidies were bad for the environment and promoted unfair competition .
but germany fiercely protested , saying that the subsidies kept its coal industry afloat , and that a 2014 phase-out would endanger too many jobs .
job security for some 25,000 workers employed at five mines around germany would have been threatened by a 2014 deadline .
berlin welcomed the commission 's decision as " a great success , " government spokesman steffen seibert said wednesday .
the extension of coal subsidies to 2018 would enable germany to meet its social obligations to the country 's miners , he added .
the premier of germany 's saarland state , which is home to one of the country 's largest mines , welcomed the eu decision to yield to german pressure .
peter mueller said the continuation of subsidies until 2018 was a " socially acceptable solution for miners without redundancy deals . "
the four-year moratorium on mine closures should also be long enough to allow germany to restructure its coal industry without sustaining considerable losses .
of the 26 other eu member states , only romania and spain will be directly affected by the new subsidies deadline .
the deal is to set to be endorsed by eu competition ministers on friday .
environmental group greenpeace 's energy policy expert , frauke thies , said that in 2008 the german government had subsidized each individual job in unprofitable coal mines to the tune of 235,000 euros -lrb- $ 311,000 -rrb- .

a controversy involving high-profile journalists and their taped telephone calls has given india its own wikileaks-style storm .
it has been termed the " radiagate " .
india 's own ' mediagate ' top journalists are heard in conversations with influential lobbyist niira radia after the 2009 general elections , discussing who should be in the next cabinet .
radia worked as a lobbyist for two of india 's biggest industrialists : mukesh ambani , head of reliance industries , and ratan tata , whose conglomerate 's interests include phone operator tata teleservices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's former communications and information technology minister a. raja in the taped conversations , niira radia was apparently pushing for a. raja , a south indian politician , to be reinstated as a minister .
as telecom minister before the election , raja had overseen the sale of the lucrative 2g phone licences at rock bottom prices - which is now turning out as potentially one of the biggest corruption cases in indian history .
it is estimated to have cost the exchequer over $ 35 billion in lost revenues .
transcripts of the 104 tapes , many of which have been printed by two news magazines , " open " and " outlook " , have called into question the reputations of , among others , celebrity anchor barkha dutt and veteran newspaper columnist vir sanghvi .
both deny any wrong-doings .
but hartosh singh bahl , the political editor of " open " , points out that there is a larger problem .
" the people who have been caught on tape are by no means the only ones who have been part of this cosy relationship .
this extends far beyond the few journalists who have been named or have been seen on tape .
whether it leads to a larger cleanup in the immediate future , i am not so sure .
there will be a certain sense of caution .
but till journalists as a whole try to organize themselves in a way , enforce a code of ethics in day-to-day work , i am not sure things will change in the long run . "

the controversy has caused heated debates among journalists , in press clubs and other forums .
" this is a wake-up call because now it is out in the open .
it concerns a few people in the media but unfortunately these people are of high profile .
and i think a large number of people in the media are conscientious regarding their business and this should help them realize what they should not do .
i think sometimes what they should not do is more important than what they should do , " dipankar gupta argues .

and i think a large number of people in the media are conscientious regarding their business and this should help them realize what they should not do .
i think sometimes what they should not do is more important than what they should do , " dipankar gupta argues .
the controversy is far from over and could possibly mark a new chapter in indian journalism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 08.12.2010 best-case scenario still misses key climate change target großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next 10 years could determine the planet 's fate even assuming all countries makes goods on pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions , there 's still a gap between what scientists say is needed to prevent catastrophic effects of climate change and what 's been promised . for all the haggling in cancun over finance , forestry , technology transfers and open accounting , very little has been said about climate targets . the world 's pledges to tackle climate change , all contained in last year 's copenhagen accord , list voluntary cuts as well as a goal to limit global warming to below two degrees celsius .
but there 's a gap - called the gigaton gap - between what governments have pledged and what climate researchers have said is needed . " if the voluntary commitments in copenhagen were to be implemented , " said achim steiner , director of the united nations environment program , at the cancun summit , " and i put the conditional on because none of us have a guarantee at the moment that they will be implemented , then we would be 60 percent of the way of where we need to be by 2020 in addressing a climate change action program that would allow the world to still have an opportunity to stay within the two degree range . " two-degree limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increase of more than two degrees celsius would have major effects on life on earth limiting global warming to two degrees will be crucial for avoiding its worst effects and may be the cut off point for us to have any chance of doing something about the problem of climate change , according to joseph alcamo , the united nations environment program 's chief scientist . " around two or two-and-a-half degrees would be roughly the level at which there would be an increasing frequency of extreme climate events , where there would be much higher risk of reaching tipping points in the climate system , " he told deutsche welle . to have a good chance of keeping warming below the two-degree level , the scientists behind a un emissions report presented in mexico said global emissions will need to peak at around 44 gigatonnes , or 44 billion tones , by the end of the decade . if no action is taken there would be a 12-gigaton gap between actual emissions and what 's needed to limit climate change to a two degree increase by 2020 .
that 's the equivalent of about 25 percent of current emissions .
but if countries fulfill their promises the gap would be seven gigatons , alcamo said . " we can go 60 percent of the way simply by fulfilling ambitions expressed in the copenhagen accord , " he said , pointing out that the most optimistic implementation of the copenhagen accord would leave the world five gigatons short of what researchers say is necessary . more to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more use of renewable energy sources could help cut the gigaton gap but even the current best-case scenario is pockmarked with caveats still up for negotiation .
issues including like an agreement on forestry , climate finance for developing countries as well as resisting tricky accounting rules that disguise increases in emissions as decreases are all yet to be decided on . policymakers will need to dig deeper and they 'll need to do it sooner rather than later since all models for keeping warming below two degrees have one thing in common , according to ramzi elias of the european climate foundation . " all of them that have a likely chance of limiting warming to two degrees have emissions levels that peaked and started to decline before 2020 , " he told deutsche welle .
" therefore , what we do over the next 10 years is really crucial . " leaving the big investments needed for a transition to a low carbon economy until after 2020 would likely be too late because of the cumulative nature of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , elias said . costly undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are already suffering the effects of climate change but if the costs seem steep now , closing the gap completely will likely be doubly expensive , according to michel den elzen of the netherlands ' environmental assessment agency .
he put the price tag for current copenhagen promises at between $ 60 billion and $ 100 billion . " to close the gap , i think it is in the order of 0.3 percent of the worldwide gdp , " he told deutsche welle , adding that it would be equal to about $ 200 billion . uk climate secretary chris huhne , however , said the costs of inaction were even higher , pointing out that the extreme weather events of 2010 were a taste of things to come . " anybody who is any doubt about that please go and talk to the big insurance companies , because they are paying out for this , " he said . " just in the uk alone over the last 10 years , the payout for flooding was 4.5 billion pounds , whereas in the 10 years before that it was 1.5 billion pounds .
this is hard business evidence of the costs that are being inflicted on our economies and we have to tackle this problem .

the 54-year old , who has dedicated his life to the fight for more civil rights in china , has been declared an enemy of the state . liu xiaobo has been known as one of the most prominent critics of the chinese regime for decades .
the civil rights activist has been in jail for nearly two years now .
this is not the first time that he has been locked up - the first time was after the bloody crackdown on the chinese democracy movement in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1989 : a student blocks a line of tanks near tiananmen square " i was on my bike home .
it was about midnight .
a car was following me and forced me to stop .
a couple of people came out , " liu recalled in a 2007 interview with deutsche welle .
" they blindfolded me , tied me up and pushed me into the car .
i was really scared .
i thought that they would take me somewhere and just shoot me . "
' duty ' to fight for justice liu xiaobo , who had studied literature , had taken the side of the chinese students fighting for more democracy on tiananmen square in 1989 .
after two years in jail , his will to fight was still not broken .
again , he was detained in 1995 and 1996 .
but he continued the struggle , explaining , " many innocent people were killed during the tiananmen massacre .
i believe that it is my duty to fight for justice to those who gave their lives .
it is a duty that i can not abandon , " he said .
charter ' 08 in late 2008 , liu xiaobo was arrested once more .
he had been one of the main initiators of the so-called ' charter ' 08 ' manifesto , which was published on the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights . the manifesto called for political reforms in china , including a system of checks and balances , freedom of speech and a competitive multi-party democracy .
as many as ten thousand intellectuals and academics have signed the petition so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo 's wife liu xia is under constant surveillance " many in his position would have given up .
but xiaobo has the mental strength .
if he believes in a goal , he 'll try to reach that goal by all means , even if he knows that he will never be able to reach it , " liu xia , his wife , had said in an interview .
" he can be really stubborn . "
she had had an uneasy feeling and sensed that the communist party would let her husband pay dearly for the charter ' 08 .
sentenced for ' subversion ' in december 2009 , a chinese court sentenced liu xiaobo to eleven years in jail on subversion charges .
in 2007 , he had already anticipated what could happen to him .
" i ’ ve once said that it is a dissident ’ s professional hazard to lose his freedom and being under surveillance .
it is part of a dissident ’ s job , " he told deutsche welle .
" it is your own choice .
you can do other things , be a salesman or a teacher , and earn easy money .
but as soon as you decide to be a dissident , you should withstand pressure with optimism , self-confidence and composure . "
committee defies china liu xiaobo is serving his sentence in a detention facility 500 kilometers northeast of beijing .
once a month he is allowed to receive visitors .
the chinese authorities have harshly protested against the pro-democracy activist receiving the nobel peace prize .
the executive secretary of the norwegian nobel committee geir lundestad reported that the chinese government explicitly threatened the committee not to give the prize to liu .
the decision would have a negative impact on chinese-norwegian relations , beijing said .
bildunterschrift : liu has been sentenced to eleven years in prison for ' subversive ' activities liu had also anticipated this kind of a move : " some european politicians fear that a discussion about human rights can have a negative impact on their economic relations with china .
i don ’ t think so .
the political relationship between china and japan is full of tensions .
but china 's trade relations with japan are among the largest with any country .
so you can see that both these two things do not have anything to do with each other . "

he told deutsche welle that wikileaks unilaterally announced wikileaks.ch as the official domain name last week . wikileaks announced on friday on twitter that its new official domain name was wikileaks.ch , which is owned by the pirate party of switzerland .
like its counterparts around europe , the party stands for reform of copyright law , abolishing the patent system , the right to privacy , and other digital issues . wikileaks.ch forwards to wikileaks ' site , which is currently being hosted in france .
other european domain names , including wikileaks.de for germany , and wikileaks.fi for finland , also point to the new host .
to learn more about the relationship between the swiss pirate party and wikileaks , deutsche welle spoke with denis simonet , the party 's president . deutsche welle : when did you acquire the wikileaks.ch domain name and why did you decide to acquire it ? denis simonet : that was six months ago based on a request from the pirate party of switzerland .
wikileaks is one sign of a problem that has to be solved .
we are for free speech , free media .
the media has to safeguard the media and if they ca n't do it or do n't do it , then our democracy is in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switch , the swiss registrar , told simonet that there is no reason to block wikileaks.ch did you buy the domain as a measure of support for wikileaks , or did wikileaks ask you to do it ? we did so for ourselves .
we do n't host content anyway .
it 's just a re-direction to the servers .
there are many other servers that do the same .
you can just register a domain and forward it .
it 's no big issue .
we did n't ask to do it .
we just did it because a member thought that it was something the pirate party should do to show support . how did you come into contact with wikileaks and with julian assange ? that was a totally different story .
about three or four weeks ago , he announced in the press that he was seeking a request for political asylum in switzerland .
our board decided that because the reason that he has to request asylum is that he is the media spokesperson for wikileaks and that he is in danger now because he is the media spokesperson .
we thought that switzerland could position itself internationally as a place where freedom of media , freedom of opinion and information is of highly considered status .
that 's why i tried to get in contact with julian assange , so we could help him . the help was to inform him about how switzerland works , about how we have a direct democracy , our federal system of cantons .
i explained the political and administrate landscape in switzerland .
that was a big part of the discussion .
he just listened .
he did n't ask for help , he did n't say anything about whether it helps or if he will stay in switzerland or what his future plans are .
he just said " thank you , " and that 's it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange met with simonet in geneva in november what was he like ?
was he at ease ?
did he seem nervous ? he explained to us what the wikileaks philosophy is .
what he 's said in public is what he is .
he was exactly what i expected .
he has a cause and he wants this cause to be known by the world . did you mention that you had the wikileaks.ch domain name ? no , not at all .
wikileaks.ch was n't part of our discussion .
there was no agreement between us .
wikileaks decided unilaterally to communicate wikileaks.ch as the working , official domain name .
the redirection worked for six months and we did n't change anything .
we did n't get a notice .
we just saw the tweet and then the media began to run to us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks continues to be a thorn in the side of many governments around the world have you had any contact with any law enforcement from switzerland , or anywhere else in europe , or the united states ? no .
no one .
and we have n't had any contact with wikileaks , by the way .
we do n't have contact with them anymore , since that meeting . members of the american government have said that they want wikileaks to return the data it has released and to stop its operation .
are you surprised by the government reaction from the technical side ? no .
it 's well-known that sometimes governments do n't really know what they 're talking about when it comes to technical stuff .
that 's why we exist .
no one understands what digital politics means .
we are fighting to improve that situation - we are working to have digital politics for switzerland .
i think that it wo n't help if people know that we have wikileaks.ch , but it will help if we can start discussions about digital politics . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the row has been brewing since monday , when germany flatly rejected on legal and economic grounds a proposal by juncker for joint eurozone bonds .
in an article to be published thursday in german weekly die zeit , juncker labeled the german reaction as " un-european , " and attacked the government of chancellor angela merkel for not taking a proper look at his proposal - aimed at helping weaker eurozone countries like greece , ireland and portugal raise money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says germany is being un-european " they are rejecting an idea before studying it ...
this way of creating taboo areas in europe and not dealing with others ' ideas is a very un-european way of dealing with european matters , " said juncker , who is also luxembourg 's prime minister .
" germany is thinking a bit simple on that , " he added .
the joint bonds - or e-bonds - could help eurozone members seen as having unstable public finances lower their borrowing costs .
as it stands , the interest that weaker eurozone states must pay out on government bonds stands at more than double - and sometimes triple - the interest paid by stronger members , such as germany .
it is believed such high interest rates for irish and greek bonds contributed to both countries having to seek huge loans from the eu and international monetary fund recently - 110 billion euros and 85 billion euros respectively .
german reaction merkel retorted to juncker 's comments on his e-bond proposal by saying his words were causing unease on world markets .
the yield on a 10-year german government bond recently shot up to 3 percent from 2.4 percent in early november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says juncker 's comments are causing market instability " it does n't help anyone in europe if european figures call each other un-european , " commented merkel 's spokesman steffen seibert in a regular government briefing .
" it is exactly this talking against other people and about other people which should stop , because the markets definitely see this finger-pointing as a sign of discord . "
" the german government remains opposed to the proposal .
the legal and economic concerns about the euro bonds will remain in place for the weeks ahead , " he added .
merkel herself called for " calm " ahead of an eu leaders ' summit next friday , where talks will focus on creating a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone and what the chancellor called " narrow " changes to eu treaties .
" i think that we should work in a calm and goal-oriented manner towards what awaits us next friday .
this calm manner is my contribution to making sure we are successful next friday , " merkel told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 08.12.2010 world bank wants climate funding to be scaled up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank says climate funding does have its problems in an exclusive interview , the world bank 's special envoy for climate change tells deutsche welle about the problems climate funding is facing and why the world bank wants to lend a helping hand . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , the world bank is already a major provider of loans to developing countries to help them tackle climate change and shift toward renewable energy technologies .
they manage 6.3 billion dollars -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- worth of climate investment funds which are allocated to 43 countries .
deutsche welle interviewed andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , to find out what role the world bank wants to play in shaping future climate funding .
dw : what 's working well in the system of climate funding and what are the current flaws in the system ?
andrew steer : i think there 's a lot that is working well , but it 's not yet happening at the scale that is required .
we are the manager for example of the climate investment funds that we implement together with the regional development bank . the good thing about them is the leverage that they get .
by putting in relatively modest amounts of grant money , one can change the behavior of private investors in quite a good way .
so for example the biggest cif is the clean technology fund which is a 4 billion dollar fund .
as a result of that , there will be a total of 40 billion dollars of investment in clean technology .
so it 's a sort of ten to one ratio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steer says large-scale solar energy projects will generate revenue for developing countries .
unfortunately there will never be enough public grant money available to solve all the problems so the name of the game will be to make sure we get this degree of leverage where public funds , private funds and carbon market funds come together .
that 's an example of a positive story .
now overall it is true that some countries are finding that there are too many sources of funding and it 's all a bit complicated , so one of the things we did here in cancun was to launch a website together with undp -lsb- united nations development agency -rsb- that basically tries to untangle the spaghetti .
it will cut out a lot of the transaction costs that are normally associated with financing .
the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- which has played a very good role , is in need of overhaul .
delays are quite considerable , transaction costs are quite high , and predictability of the system is not what it needs to be .
and also money tends to go to a small number of middle income countries .
so we have been favoring reform of the cdm that would reduce costs , increase predictability and would extend the markets into low income countries .
dw : to what extent is the world bank best placed to manage climate investment funds ?
andrew steer : we are not seeking to fly our own flag .
we are simply offering to be helpful .
our speciality is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
we need to now get serious about the problem .
that requires an agency that can operate with large financial packages , engage with governments on monetary issues , bring together different types of finance and that has engagement across a range of sectors .
and we are privileged to have expertise and experience in those areas .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have protested against the world bank in cancun dw : you say you can play a helpful role .
if that 's the case , why are people in cancun demonstrating today against the world bank being in charge of climate assistance ?
andrew steer : i 'm not aware of them demonstrating against it .
views understandably differ .
that 's healthy .
we 're not for one moment suggesting that the world bank is uniquely qualified , but we do believe we have a very helpful role to play .
dw : a lot of this funding is actually loans .
tove ryding , a representative from greenpeace , has said that giving developing countries loans to help them deal with the consequences of climate change caused primarily by developed nations is " the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage . "
what do you say to that ?
andrew steer : this is for negotiators to decide .
that 's why we 're here in cancun .
it 's not the world bank that decides to make it loans rather than grants .
the world bank gives grants , but it also gives zero interest loans for some investments in renewable energy and some investments we give loans that have market based rates .
those decisions are made by the providers of funds and those are represented here by the parties .
i would make just one point and that is , the countries we are working in - and we are working in over 130 countries on climate change - are saying to us , ' we want to get on with it .
we want to be part of a green industrial revolution .
we want to make our economy grow rapidly in a climate resilient way and we want to have access to resources . '
it 's very encouraging because we 're seeing a lot of leadership in developing countries as they want to get on with things and if the choice is between a grant or a loan , you or i or anybody else would prefer a grant .
but that depends on whether or not the countries that are providing the funds want to provide them as grants .
if they do n't , then it 's very encouraging that , nonetheless , a lot of developing countries are getting on with it .
they do n't want to just talk about it .
they want to actually do it .
we believe that cancun really needs to deliver .
it 's possible , it could deliver something very important and we 're really hoping that in the next few days we 'll see that .

after a six-month preparatory program entitled " good governance in afghanistan , " the students are ready to begin a masters course in public policy .
high hopes and clear ambitions moheb jarbakhail is one of 27 young afghans at the willy brandt school .
the 25-year-old says he wants to return to kabul at the end of his course , armed with skills he has learned .
" people like myself can make a significant difference to afghanistan for two reasons , " moheb told deutsche welle .
" one , we get all the academic knowledge of how to govern a society , and the second is : we are from that country , we understand the internal politics .
so , i see my future in helping the afghan public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez wants to help afghan women moheb has been studying in erfurt for almost a year .
before that , he completed a degree in economics at the university of kabul , studied in the us and also worked for an aid organization in afghanistan .
one of only five women on the course is 23 year-old hajar mobarez .
she already knows what women can achieve in afghanistan .
her mother is a member of parliament in kabul .
over the summer holidays , hajar helped her with the election campaign .
the women drove round remote villages , distributing campaign leaflets .
" i want to work for the government , especially in the area of economic development , " hajar said .
" i also want to work for empowering women through providing more educational opportunities . "
can western democracy work in afghanistan ?
a lecturer on the course , kristina roepstorff , has had endless debates with her students , about whether western-style democracy can function in countries like afghanistan .
" some of them strongly rejected the idea of democracy at first , " roepstoff said .
" over time they 've learnt that there are various types of democracy .
they can see it 's a system that makes sense , and that could settle ethnic conflicts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frangis spanta is looking for the best applicants the course is partly financed by the german foreign ministry , and the students also get a grant from the german academic exchange sercive -lrb- daad -rrb- .
frangis spanta , the daughter of a former afghan foreign minister coordinates the masters program .
she 's received 120 applications for next year 's course , although there are just 10 places .
applicants need to bring with them excellent marks , a strong knowledge of english , and political experience .
however not every afghan politician is behind the idea of the germans forging their elite .
" on a political level of course some of the ministries are skeptical , " spanta said .
" they say : ' ok , they 're being trained over there .
but can they really use what they 've learned in germany ? '
the thing is though , afghanistan needs these capabilities . "
hope of the nation in some senses , the young afghans are carrying the weight of their home country on their shoulders .
moheb jarbakhail feels the pressure , but is ambitious and hopeful about the future : " i would like to succeed , " he said .
" i would like to use this opportunity that is given to me to be a knowledgeable person and that pressure is from within and that is one of the motivations that has brought me here to germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez with her german guest parents the students learn all about german culture from their guest parents and at the same time , are motivated by the idea of creating a more positive image of their country .
" i wish that whenever everyone asks me : ‘ where do you come from ? '
i proudly say : ‘ i am from afghanistan , " ' said hajar mobarez .

if talks in cancun fail , he will go on with his struggle . just a few weeks ago , chen faqing turned up at the mexican embassy in beijing .
he told the officials there he wanted to donate 250,000 yuan to the climate summit in cancun – with no conditions .
the embassy officials were a little skeptical at first but then the money was transferred – exactly 37,022 dollars and 21 cents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming has an increasing effect on the arctic region with glaciers shrinking chen said it was money well spent : " we only have this world .
some countries are only thinking of economic development and their national interest .
but that will harm all humanity .
protecting the earth has to be a priority . "
chen has already used up a good deal of his savings for his crusade .
he has donated 40,000 us dollars to the secretariat of the intergovernmental panel on climate change in geneva and he has taken out ads in the international press , such as the wall street journal and the economist , too .
" i hope that thanks to my advertisements all the governments will understand what a catastrophe climate change is .
the chinese people 's newspaper refused to print my ad , saying it could lead to diplomatic pressure , " he said .
activism triggered by local water pollution in his adverts , chen presents himself as a disabled farmer although this is only partly true .
however , he is very hard of hearing .
he started off poor but worked his way up – rearing poultry and cattle and making various investments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate during the un climate summit in cancun he first became interested in the environment at the end of the 1990s as more and more people in his village started contracting lung disease .
he was concerned that the rivers were being polluted by the local factories .
for years , chen tried in vain to pressure the local authorities into acting against the pollution .
he then tried to sue them ; then he tried to sue the environment ministry in beijing , and even prime minister wen jiabao but all in vain .
everybody has to work together " the government has to bear more responsibility regarding greenhouse gases .
the world will only be saved if everybody does something , " he insisted .
he said he refused to give up his fight , even if no deal was reached in cancun : " next year , i will continue taking out adverts in the international media and i will donate money to support further climate talks . "
the mexican government had arranged for chen to be present in cancun , like all big donors but he refused .
he says he ca n't speak english .
moreover , he was urgently needed at home in his village – his wife had hoped he would spend his life savings on building a new house , not on saving the planet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo opinion -pipe- 08.12.2010 opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange is in custody in the uk , over swedish charges of sexual misconduct .
deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

the row has been brewing since monday , when germany flatly rejected on legal and economic grounds a proposal by juncker for joint eurozone bonds .
in an article to be published thursday in german weekly die zeit , juncker labeled the german reaction as " un-european , " and attacked the government of chancellor angela merkel for not taking a proper look at his proposal - aimed at helping weaker eurozone countries like greece , ireland and portugal raise money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says germany is being un-european " they are rejecting an idea before studying it ...
this way of creating taboo areas in europe and not dealing with others ' ideas is a very un-european way of dealing with european matters , " said juncker , who is also luxembourg 's prime minister .
" germany is thinking a bit simple on that , " he added .
the joint bonds - or e-bonds - could help eurozone members seen as having unstable public finances lower their borrowing costs .
as it stands , the interest that weaker eurozone states must pay out on government bonds stands at more than double - and sometimes triple - the interest paid by stronger members , such as germany .
it is believed such high interest rates for irish and greek bonds contributed to both countries having to seek huge loans from the eu and international monetary fund recently - 110 billion euros and 85 billion euros respectively .
german reaction merkel retorted to juncker 's comments on his e-bond proposal by saying his words were causing unease on world markets .
the yield on a 10-year german government bond recently shot up to 3 percent from 2.4 percent in early november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says juncker 's comments are causing market instability " it does n't help anyone in europe if european figures call each other un-european , " commented merkel 's spokesman steffen seibert in a regular government briefing .
" it is exactly this talking against other people and about other people which should stop , because the markets definitely see this finger-pointing as a sign of discord . "
" the german government remains opposed to the proposal .
the legal and economic concerns about the euro bonds will remain in place for the weeks ahead , " he added .
merkel herself called for " calm " ahead of an eu leaders ' summit next friday , where talks will focus on creating a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone and what the chancellor called " narrow " changes to eu treaties .
" i think that we should work in a calm and goal-oriented manner towards what awaits us next friday .
this calm manner is my contribution to making sure we are successful next friday , " merkel told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.12.2010 german government proposes tougher laws for tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just filing backtaxes and an apology might not cut the mustard anymore germany 's cabinet has published a draft law designed to get tough on tax evaders and money launderers .
the new law is supposed to make it harder for tax dodgers to admit their crimes themselves , thus avoiding a trial . the german cabinet on wednesday finalized new draft legislation on tax evasion , as it attempts to close some of the loop holes that allow tax dodgers to avoid prosecution once authorities get wind of their misdemeanors .
the draft bill by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble would make it more difficult for offenders to dodge legal proceedings by preemptively admitting their guilt and paying back taxes .
under current german law , people can avoid a trial by issuing a so-called " voluntary disclosure , " detailing the taxes they have skipped and paying them with 6 percent interest - provided they do so before they are officially prosecuted .
tax evaders can still file a voluntary disclosure after being notified that their assets are under investigation , but the deadline would change under the proposed legislation , meaning that once you have been warned , it 's too late to confess .
" these prosecution-avoiding voluntary disclosures will therefore no longer be effective as part of a calculated tax evasion strategy , " the financial policy spokesman for the christian democratic union , leo dautzenberg , said in an interview with the newspaper die welt .
some german tax dodgers have been abusing this legal loop hole by deliberately waiting until they received their pro-forma warning , and then declaring their assets .
full disclosure the new draft law would also make voluntary disclosures valid only if tax dodgers comprehensively admit to all the assets they have failed to declare that have not become legally outdated .
" people submitting voluntary disclosures will only be immune to proseuction if they completely and accurately disclose information on all assets that qualify for any form of tax , " a government statement says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent government purchase of stolen bank data prompted the debate but of course , the tax authorities would first have to find any withheld funds or assets in order to make a case .
germany recently registered a wave of almost 30,000 voluntary admissions after purchasing cds containing stolen data on foreign bank accounts held by german citizens , as people realized the information might incriminate them .
" our experiences with the flood of voluntary disclosures after the debate over the purchase of tax data highlighted the need to change our legal system and limit the ways in which tax evaders can avoid prosecution , " the budgetary and financial spokesman for the christian social union , bartholomaeus kalb , told parliament on wednesday .
too little , too late ?
however , the proposed changes would represent only a slight tightening of germany 's already lax tax evasion laws , and critics have derided the draft law as a " mini-solution " by a center-right coalition government that does n't want to get too tough on the subject .
" the coalition has become nervous because of the public outcry over the case of the swiss bank data cds , " the chairman of the german union of tax workers , dieter ondracek , told deutsche welle .
" that made ordinary citizens aware of the possibility of submitting a voluntary disclosure , and they were unhappy with the law . "
" the politicians do n't really want to address the issue , because they see revenue from these disclosures as money in the bank , without any messy litigation . "
ondracek , however , believes that it would be better to get rid of voluntary disclosures altogether , arguing the german approach to tax evasion implies that it 's not really considered a crime .
" it 's not just important , it 's a matter of urgency , " ondracek said .
" this possibility only exists for one crime - tax evasion .
how can a crime be serious if you can absolve yourself of legal responsibility at the last minute just by owning up ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister schaeuble could do with the extra cash " in reality , tax evasion is comparable with embezzlement or theft , except you 're not stealing from one person , you 're stealing from every german citizen .
remember , this is a problem that costs our government and taxpayers an absolute minimum of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.2 billion -rrb- per year . "
wasted chance to tackle the deficit ?
that 10 billion euro bottom estimate would represent just under one fifth of the money the heavily indebted german government plans to borrow in 2011 .
missing taxes do not become legally out-dated for 10 years , meaning that german tax dodgers currently owe at least 100 billion euros .
" it would make more sense to try to balance the budget by doing everything we can to secure these missing taxes that people are legally obliged to pay the government , " ondracek said .
" instead , we 're taking out more loans and passing on the interest to our grandchildren . "
the opposition social democrats had also advocated abolishing the voluntary disclosure system altogether , in favor of letting the courts decide whether or not tax evaders deserved to avoid jail sentences or other legal punishments .
" the legal procedure involving voluntary disclosures has existed in germany for 90 years now , " kalb of the christian social union countered .
" it has proved its worth and remains a useful mechanism .
abolishing this system , as per the -lsb- social democrats ' -rsb- suggestion , would be unwise . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 08.12.2010 music hotel brings new beat to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the trendy hotel class with berlin 's indigenous underground music scene ?
berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .
" it 's a different mentality .
that 's also what makes the city unique - that so many different cultures coexist . " author : rebecca schmid editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 08.12.2010 music hotel brings new beat to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the trendy hotel class with berlin 's indigenous underground music scene ?
berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .
" it 's a different mentality .
that 's also what makes the city unique - that so many different cultures coexist . " author : rebecca schmid editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new unicef report finds that most kids attach great importance to family cohesion , friendship and trust . a survey compiled on behalf of unicef and officially released in berlin on wednesday takes a closer look at which social values six to 14-year-old kids in germany cherish the most . information gathered in 1,500 interviews has led the authors of the study to conclude that the vast majority of children are very highly value-oriented .
" we do n't see any decline in values in this age group as some scientists want to make us believe , " said professor hans bertram from berlin 's humboldt university during the presentation of the survey .
" values such as mutual trust , and increasingly also respect for other people 's opinions and life experiences , are extremely important for children here . "
family as a safe haven bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german children 's values are not declining , says the unicef team other qualities that rank high in the value system of the young are reliability , a sense of belonging , and honesty .
far less important for those polled appear to be money and religious faith .
but what counts most for children is family cohesion , the study says .
" of course , many kids do have problems with their parents once in a while , " said gerd bruene from the geo publishing house which was involved in the survey .
" but the kids want to feel safe and protected , and they clearly associate this with their families . "
working parents are not a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when parents are away , the children can play the study also reveals that most children here have learned to deal with the fact that many parents – increasingly also mothers – have to stay away from home for a long period to pursue their jobs .
but they enjoy the time they can spend together with their parents who are credited with largely keeping job-related problems away from the kids .
" the kids feel that there 's often a lack of time for working mothers to spend with them , " said sociologist hans bertram .
" but many youngsters also feel they have more freedom to pursue their own activities while their mothers are away . "
german children fully accept the primary role of both parents and teachers to instill values of social behavior in them . only a small proportion would make use of the media for this , and even fewer care about what religious leaders or politicians tell them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 08.12.2010 a new elite for afghanistan - made in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students are among the most talented in afghanistan talented afghan students are coming to erfurt to learn about public policy .
they hope to go back to their country armed with the skills to take up leading positions in ministries or in non-governmental organizations . since 2008 , a number of young afghans have been coming to study at the willy brandt school of public policy at the university of erfurt in central germany .
they learn how to govern countries effectively .
the students have an ambitious goal : to build a peaceful , democratic state in afghanistan , and to rid the country of terror and violence .
in the future , these students hope to form the afghan elite , to find jobs in government ministries or ngos .
after a six-month preparatory program entitled " good governance in afghanistan , " the students are ready to begin a masters course in public policy .
high hopes and clear ambitions moheb jarbakhail is one of 27 young afghans at the willy brandt school .
the 25-year-old says he wants to return to kabul at the end of his course , armed with skills he has learned .
" people like myself can make a significant difference to afghanistan for two reasons , " moheb told deutsche welle .
" one , we get all the academic knowledge of how to govern a society , and the second is : we are from that country , we understand the internal politics .
so , i see my future in helping the afghan public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez wants to help afghan women moheb has been studying in erfurt for almost a year .
before that , he completed a degree in economics at the university of kabul , studied in the us and also worked for an aid organization in afghanistan .
one of only five women on the course is 23 year-old hajar mobarez .
she already knows what women can achieve in afghanistan .
her mother is a member of parliament in kabul .
over the summer holidays , hajar helped her with the election campaign .
the women drove round remote villages , distributing campaign leaflets .
" i want to work for the government , especially in the area of economic development , " hajar said .
" i also want to work for empowering women through providing more educational opportunities . "
can western democracy work in afghanistan ?
a lecturer on the course , kristina roepstorff , has had endless debates with her students , about whether western-style democracy can function in countries like afghanistan .
" some of them strongly rejected the idea of democracy at first , " roepstoff said .
" over time they 've learnt that there are various types of democracy .
they can see it 's a system that makes sense , and that could settle ethnic conflicts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frangis spanta is looking for the best applicants the course is partly financed by the german foreign ministry , and the students also get a grant from the german academic exchange sercive -lrb- daad -rrb- .
frangis spanta , the daughter of a former afghan foreign minister coordinates the masters program .
she 's received 120 applications for next year 's course , although there are just 10 places .
applicants need to bring with them excellent marks , a strong knowledge of english , and political experience .
however not every afghan politician is behind the idea of the germans forging their elite .
" on a political level of course some of the ministries are skeptical , " spanta said .
" they say : ' ok , they 're being trained over there .
but can they really use what they 've learned in germany ? '
the thing is though , afghanistan needs these capabilities . "
hope of the nation in some senses , the young afghans are carrying the weight of their home country on their shoulders .
moheb jarbakhail feels the pressure , but is ambitious and hopeful about the future : " i would like to succeed , " he said .
" i would like to use this opportunity that is given to me to be a knowledgeable person and that pressure is from within and that is one of the motivations that has brought me here to germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez with her german guest parents the students learn all about german culture from their guest parents and at the same time , are motivated by the idea of creating a more positive image of their country .
" i wish that whenever everyone asks me : ‘ where do you come from ? '
i proudly say : ‘ i am from afghanistan , " ' said hajar mobarez .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo opinion -pipe- 08.12.2010 opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange is in custody in the uk , over swedish charges of sexual misconduct .
deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo opinion -pipe- 08.12.2010 opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange is in custody in the uk , over swedish charges of sexual misconduct .
deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

they manage 6.3 billion dollars -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- worth of climate investment funds which are allocated to 43 countries .
deutsche welle interviewed andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , to find out what role the world bank wants to play in shaping future climate funding .
dw : what 's working well in the system of climate funding and what are the current flaws in the system ?
andrew steer : i think there 's a lot that is working well , but it 's not yet happening at the scale that is required .
we are the manager for example of the climate investment funds that we implement together with the regional development bank . the good thing about them is the leverage that they get .
by putting in relatively modest amounts of grant money , one can change the behavior of private investors in quite a good way .
so for example the biggest cif is the clean technology fund which is a 4 billion dollar fund .
as a result of that , there will be a total of 40 billion dollars of investment in clean technology .
so it 's a sort of ten to one ratio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steer says large-scale solar energy projects will generate revenue for developing countries .
unfortunately there will never be enough public grant money available to solve all the problems so the name of the game will be to make sure we get this degree of leverage where public funds , private funds and carbon market funds come together .
that 's an example of a positive story .
now overall it is true that some countries are finding that there are too many sources of funding and it 's all a bit complicated , so one of the things we did here in cancun was to launch a website together with undp -lsb- united nations development agency -rsb- that basically tries to untangle the spaghetti .
it will cut out a lot of the transaction costs that are normally associated with financing .
the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- which has played a very good role , is in need of overhaul .
delays are quite considerable , transaction costs are quite high , and predictability of the system is not what it needs to be .
and also money tends to go to a small number of middle income countries .
so we have been favoring reform of the cdm that would reduce costs , increase predictability and would extend the markets into low income countries .
dw : to what extent is the world bank best placed to manage climate investment funds ?
andrew steer : we are not seeking to fly our own flag .
we are simply offering to be helpful .
our speciality is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
we need to now get serious about the problem .
that requires an agency that can operate with large financial packages , engage with governments on monetary issues , bring together different types of finance and that has engagement across a range of sectors .
and we are privileged to have expertise and experience in those areas .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have protested against the world bank in cancun dw : you say you can play a helpful role .
if that 's the case , why are people in cancun demonstrating today against the world bank being in charge of climate assistance ?
andrew steer : i 'm not aware of them demonstrating against it .
views understandably differ .
that 's healthy .
we 're not for one moment suggesting that the world bank is uniquely qualified , but we do believe we have a very helpful role to play .
dw : a lot of this funding is actually loans .
tove ryding , a representative from greenpeace , has said that giving developing countries loans to help them deal with the consequences of climate change caused primarily by developed nations is " the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage . "
what do you say to that ?
andrew steer : this is for negotiators to decide .
that 's why we 're here in cancun .
it 's not the world bank that decides to make it loans rather than grants .
the world bank gives grants , but it also gives zero interest loans for some investments in renewable energy and some investments we give loans that have market based rates .
those decisions are made by the providers of funds and those are represented here by the parties .
i would make just one point and that is , the countries we are working in - and we are working in over 130 countries on climate change - are saying to us , ' we want to get on with it .
we want to be part of a green industrial revolution .
we want to make our economy grow rapidly in a climate resilient way and we want to have access to resources . '
it 's very encouraging because we 're seeing a lot of leadership in developing countries as they want to get on with things and if the choice is between a grant or a loan , you or i or anybody else would prefer a grant .
but that depends on whether or not the countries that are providing the funds want to provide them as grants .
if they do n't , then it 's very encouraging that , nonetheless , a lot of developing countries are getting on with it .
they do n't want to just talk about it .
they want to actually do it .
we believe that cancun really needs to deliver .
it 's possible , it could deliver something very important and we 're really hoping that in the next few days we 'll see that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 08.12.2010 music hotel brings new beat to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the trendy hotel class with berlin 's indigenous underground music scene ?
berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .
" it 's a different mentality .
that 's also what makes the city unique - that so many different cultures coexist . " author : rebecca schmid editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the nation slips towards chaos , the international community fears a return to war . the situation in ivory coast remains tense after claims and counter-claims from the country 's two presidential candidates who continue to be at odds over which of them has the right to govern the former french colony .
the opposition challenger alassane ouattara and incumbent laurent gbagbo have both claimed victory in the nov .
28 election and have both sworn themselves in as president .
ouattara was declared the winner by the country 's electoral commission after the run-off , with provisional results giving him a 10 percent lead over gbagbo , and has begun to name senior officials in his new government .
the result in favor of ouattara has since been ratified by the united nations and recognized by international community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo and ouattara both claimed victory in the election despite ouattara 's support in the international community , gbagbo continues to hold control over the country 's military and state media , giving him two very powerful advantages over his rival .
he has also defied international calls to cede power and has rejected the un 's ratification of the result .
the current situation raises fears of a return to the violent divisions which split the nation in two between the rebel-controlled north and government-controlled south during the civil war of 2002-2003 .
in an ominous reflection of that conflict , ivory coast 's borders and sea ports were closed by the army over the weekend and foreign news broadcasts in the country were disrupted as public demonstrations across the country turned violent , leaving at least 17 people dead .
by sunday night , the borders and ports had been reopened .
international concern heightens as crisis deepens the situation is already sending nervous ripples through the international community , especially in organizations responsible for funding development programs in the poverty-stricken nation .
the world bank and the african development bank have both questioned the " usefulness and effectiveness " of their aid programs to ivory coast given the breakdown in governance and have admitted to concerns that the turmoil in the country could drive many more ivorians further into poverty while causing instability and affecting economic prosperity in the wider west african sub-region .
the european union has threatened targeted sanctions and could cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid if there is no swift resolution to the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international organizations fear the unrest could spread meanwhile , the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- at a meeting on tuesday said it recognized quatarra as ivory coast 's president-elect and urged gbagbo to accept defeat .
" although the situation is troubling , the international community has reacted very quickly , " richard gowan , an africa expert with the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the au , ecowas and un have made it clear that the world is watching what happens next in cote d 'ivoire .
big firms with cocoa and mining interests in the country have done the same .
with luck , this level of scrutiny will deter both sides from escalating tensions into all-out violence . "
gowan added that it was essential that big powers , especially the us , france and nigeria , supported mbeki 's mediation efforts and remained closely involved in the processs .
compromise seems impossible , even with un intervention the seemingly immovable stances taken by both ouattara and gbagbo suggest that any mediation will be slow and as the confusion over the election run-off result entered its second week , concerns began to increase over whether a peaceful solution could be found .
dr. dirk khonert , the deputy director of the institute of african affairs at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- and a member of the eu election observation team in ivory coast , said that the main stumbling block to a solution was whether both rival candidates would be prepared to accept defeat . " ouattara has a very strong international backing against gbagbo , " he told deutsche welle .
" thus , he derives his legitimacy not only internally but also externally by the backing of the international community .
it is difficult to imagine under these conditions that he and his followers would be inclined to accept a compromise on the question of the presidency . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un efforts to keep the peace may not prevent conflict it is unlikely that a compromise will satisfy either man as any deal may have to be brokered by the united nations which has given its support to ouattara , therefore alienating gbagbo 's team .
gbagbo has a long record of ignoring international pressure and appears to be ready to take the country to the brink of war to retain power .
he is also unlikely to consider the best option available to mbeki and the african union mediators which would be a government of national reconciliation , with ouattara as president and a significant input of gbagbo activists in the cabinet .
" if the international community would be really united in its firm stand against the loser of the election , which it sees as gbagbo , there would be a viable chance for successful mediation , " khonert said .
" unfortunately , the un security council did not back the decision of the un in this question because of divergent views and a subsequent veto by russia . "
khonert added that security council intervention would not guarantee success .
" that would require a robust mandate , backed by considerable additional military engagement , which would be more than the 8,500 un troops currently present in ivory coast , and additional finance .
it is doubtful under the present conditions , whether the major parties involved would agree to this . " rival factions ready for a return to war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high that a new civil war could divide the nation should massive public demonstrations begin in an attempt to force a solution , ivory coast may find itself slipping closer to a new civil war .
ouatarra commands the support of the rebel-controlled north while gbagbo has the sworn allegiance of the army .
rebel leaders have already said that they will not wait long to take action should gbagbo refuse to stand down .
" in view of the history of violent conflicts in the ivory coast in the past decade , there is a high risk of a return to civil war , " khonert said .
" the most dangerous element is the unpredictable attitude of the militias of the presidential contenders ; the ' jeune patriots ' in abidjan or duekoué in the western region of the country . "
for richard gowan the worst-case scenario is a return to full-scale conflict .
" in that case , the un peacekeepers do n't have the forces to stop war and france , which has troops in the country , will want to avoid getting dragged into fighting .
diplomacy is the last best hope . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

researchers suggest children might be able to help their parents learn how to use the internet more effectively . on tuesday , the findings of a europe-wide study on young people and the internet were released in berlin .
more than 23,000 children and young people between the ages of nine and 16 were interviewed across 25 european countries .
the preliminary results of the study had been released in october .
according to the research , 12 percent of the young people interviewed said they were bothered or upset by something on the internet - which is a much lower number than the researchers expected .
surprisingly the top activity young people use the internet for is homework , closely followed by entertainment and games and communication .
klaus neumann-braun , a professor at the institute for media science at the university of basel in switzerland , noted that this study should go some way towards allaying the hysteria that accompanies many discussions around young people and the internet .
in germany young people spend 50 precent of their time communicating with their friends on the internet - creating their online profile , messaging friends and so on .
a window to the outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuelervz.net remains a very popular social networking site in germany amongst school-age kids uwe hasebrink , chairman of the german part of the eu kids online network and director of the hans bredow institute for media research in hamburg said that young people have really embraced social networking sites , which has become an important part in social development and establishing their identities .
" they have to develop their position in the societal structure .
they have to come to know people .
they have to have experiences with others .
they have to build their identity , " he said , and added that for all these factors " the social web provides enormous possibilities " .
many young people are also increasingly resourceful in their use of the internet to solve everyday problems .
hasebrink described the situation of an 11-year-old afghan girl living in germany with her family that has strict cultural values .
" this girl told us that she writes a diary in a social networking site .
it is completely protected by a password .
she is the only person who can access her profile on this social networking site - nobody else - no friends " explained hasebrink .
he went on to say that the girl 's two older brothers keep a close watch over her and try to steer her away from the so-called " decadent western lifestyle , " and that her only chance to express her innermost thoughts is online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 48 percent of kids surveyed said they did not know how to change the privacy settings on sites like facebook but not every child is quite so media literate and innovative . the study also showed that 48 percent of young people do n't know how to change the privacy settings on their social networking profile , and 40 percent do n't know how to block messages from people they do n't want to have contact with .
cyberbullying threat remains low while the study found on average across the eu that bullying in real life was more prevalent than online , the polish data results surprised agnieszka wrzesien , project coordinator of the safer internet project in poland .
in the eu kids online study , five percent of polish kids reported that they had experienced cyberbullying , however the polish helpline has different figures .
they have reported yearly increases and in 2010 received 800 reports in 11 months .
wrzesien said that perhaps one reason for the discrepancy was a fear that if kids in poland mentioned cyberbullying , their parents might find out and restrict their internet or mobile phone access .
most social networking sites in poland have implemented a reporting mechanism , an abuse button , that allows children and young people to report if something bad is happening to them online .
however wrzesien said that even if they report it , this kind of problem takes time to resolve .
" within those couple of hours that the pictures may stay online , people may download them , may share them , they can be forwarded to other colleagues outside school and so on and this is a very distressing experience , " she said .
future policy recommendations in poland , wrzesien is working hard with schools and teachers in order to set up a system to prevent cyberbullying and to teach them how to respond to these incidents .
this system " would involve police , isp 's , psychologists and parents because it often happens that there needs to be police involved because the incident was so serious " , said wrzesien .
the german youth hotline called nummergegenkummer received over 20,000 calls in 2009 from kids who were having problems online .
beate friese from nummergegenkummer said that a big part of their work is teaching kids skills to resolve the problems themselves .
they also train young people to counsel other young people about problems they encounter online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study found that kids might be able to teach their parents , too parents need help , too but it 's not only kids that need help .
the study also highlights the fact that parents often have no idea what their kids are up to on the internet and do n't know how to help them if they have a problem .
some european authorities say that this problem could be alleviated if children teach their parents .
" -lsb- that will -rsb- not only bridge the gap in terms of technology , but will give them the opportunity to spend some time with their kids , " said dr. yiannis laouris , the head of the cyprus neuroscience & technology institute .
others , like uwe hasebrink , from hamburg , are calling for social networking sites to make the default setting for a user profile private .
that way , anyone can choose what he or she wants to make public .
hasebrink said that these initial findings will inform the researchers ' next steps which will be to work on correlational analysis and testing concrete hypothesis .
" so to what extent is risk experience or harm experience correlated with parental mediation ? " he said . " what is the role of school ?
what is the role of peers ?
what is the role of psychological factors ? are children generally looking for sensation ?

the 54-year old , who has dedicated his life to the fight for more civil rights in china , has been declared an enemy of the state . liu xiaobo has been known as one of the most prominent critics of the chinese regime for decades .
the civil rights activist has been in jail for nearly two years now .
this is not the first time that he has been locked up - the first time was after the bloody crackdown on the chinese democracy movement in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1989 : a student blocks a line of tanks near tiananmen square " i was on my bike home .
it was about midnight .
a car was following me and forced me to stop .
a couple of people came out , " liu recalled in a 2007 interview with deutsche welle .
" they blindfolded me , tied me up and pushed me into the car .
i was really scared .
i thought that they would take me somewhere and just shoot me . "
' duty ' to fight for justice liu xiaobo , who had studied literature , had taken the side of the chinese students fighting for more democracy on tiananmen square in 1989 .
after two years in jail , his will to fight was still not broken .
again , he was detained in 1995 and 1996 .
but he continued the struggle , explaining , " many innocent people were killed during the tiananmen massacre .
i believe that it is my duty to fight for justice to those who gave their lives .
it is a duty that i can not abandon , " he said .
charter ' 08 in late 2008 , liu xiaobo was arrested once more .
he had been one of the main initiators of the so-called ' charter ' 08 ' manifesto , which was published on the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights . the manifesto called for political reforms in china , including a system of checks and balances , freedom of speech and a competitive multi-party democracy .
as many as ten thousand intellectuals and academics have signed the petition so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo 's wife liu xia is under constant surveillance " many in his position would have given up .
but xiaobo has the mental strength .
if he believes in a goal , he 'll try to reach that goal by all means , even if he knows that he will never be able to reach it , " liu xia , his wife , had said in an interview .
" he can be really stubborn . "
she had had an uneasy feeling and sensed that the communist party would let her husband pay dearly for the charter ' 08 .
sentenced for ' subversion ' in december 2009 , a chinese court sentenced liu xiaobo to eleven years in jail on subversion charges .
in 2007 , he had already anticipated what could happen to him .
" i ’ ve once said that it is a dissident ’ s professional hazard to lose his freedom and being under surveillance .
it is part of a dissident ’ s job , " he told deutsche welle .
" it is your own choice .
you can do other things , be a salesman or a teacher , and earn easy money .
but as soon as you decide to be a dissident , you should withstand pressure with optimism , self-confidence and composure . "
committee defies china liu xiaobo is serving his sentence in a detention facility 500 kilometers northeast of beijing .
once a month he is allowed to receive visitors .
the chinese authorities have harshly protested against the pro-democracy activist receiving the nobel peace prize .
the executive secretary of the norwegian nobel committee geir lundestad reported that the chinese government explicitly threatened the committee not to give the prize to liu .
the decision would have a negative impact on chinese-norwegian relations , beijing said .
bildunterschrift : liu has been sentenced to eleven years in prison for ' subversive ' activities liu had also anticipated this kind of a move : " some european politicians fear that a discussion about human rights can have a negative impact on their economic relations with china .
i don ’ t think so .
the political relationship between china and japan is full of tensions .
but china 's trade relations with japan are among the largest with any country .
so you can see that both these two things do not have anything to do with each other . "

but there 's a gap - called the gigaton gap - between what governments have pledged and what climate researchers have said is needed . " if the voluntary commitments in copenhagen were to be implemented , " said achim steiner , director of the united nations environment program , at the cancun summit , " and i put the conditional on because none of us have a guarantee at the moment that they will be implemented , then we would be 60 percent of the way of where we need to be by 2020 in addressing a climate change action program that would allow the world to still have an opportunity to stay within the two degree range . " two-degree limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increase of more than two degrees celsius would have major effects on life on earth limiting global warming to two degrees will be crucial for avoiding its worst effects and may be the cut off point for us to have any chance of doing something about the problem of climate change , according to joseph alcamo , the united nations environment program 's chief scientist . " around two or two-and-a-half degrees would be roughly the level at which there would be an increasing frequency of extreme climate events , where there would be much higher risk of reaching tipping points in the climate system , " he told deutsche welle . to have a good chance of keeping warming below the two-degree level , the scientists behind a un emissions report presented in mexico said global emissions will need to peak at around 44 gigatonnes , or 44 billion tones , by the end of the decade . if no action is taken there would be a 12-gigaton gap between actual emissions and what 's needed to limit climate change to a two degree increase by 2020 .
that 's the equivalent of about 25 percent of current emissions .
but if countries fulfill their promises the gap would be seven gigatons , alcamo said . " we can go 60 percent of the way simply by fulfilling ambitions expressed in the copenhagen accord , " he said , pointing out that the most optimistic implementation of the copenhagen accord would leave the world five gigatons short of what researchers say is necessary . more to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more use of renewable energy sources could help cut the gigaton gap but even the current best-case scenario is pockmarked with caveats still up for negotiation .
issues including like an agreement on forestry , climate finance for developing countries as well as resisting tricky accounting rules that disguise increases in emissions as decreases are all yet to be decided on . policymakers will need to dig deeper and they 'll need to do it sooner rather than later since all models for keeping warming below two degrees have one thing in common , according to ramzi elias of the european climate foundation . " all of them that have a likely chance of limiting warming to two degrees have emissions levels that peaked and started to decline before 2020 , " he told deutsche welle .
" therefore , what we do over the next 10 years is really crucial . " leaving the big investments needed for a transition to a low carbon economy until after 2020 would likely be too late because of the cumulative nature of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , elias said . costly undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are already suffering the effects of climate change but if the costs seem steep now , closing the gap completely will likely be doubly expensive , according to michel den elzen of the netherlands ' environmental assessment agency .
he put the price tag for current copenhagen promises at between $ 60 billion and $ 100 billion . " to close the gap , i think it is in the order of 0.3 percent of the worldwide gdp , " he told deutsche welle , adding that it would be equal to about $ 200 billion . uk climate secretary chris huhne , however , said the costs of inaction were even higher , pointing out that the extreme weather events of 2010 were a taste of things to come . " anybody who is any doubt about that please go and talk to the big insurance companies , because they are paying out for this , " he said . " just in the uk alone over the last 10 years , the payout for flooding was 4.5 billion pounds , whereas in the 10 years before that it was 1.5 billion pounds .
this is hard business evidence of the costs that are being inflicted on our economies and we have to tackle this problem .

a controversy involving high-profile journalists and their taped telephone calls has given india its own wikileaks-style storm .
it has been termed the " radiagate " .
india 's own ' mediagate ' top journalists are heard in conversations with influential lobbyist niira radia after the 2009 general elections , discussing who should be in the next cabinet .
radia worked as a lobbyist for two of india 's biggest industrialists : mukesh ambani , head of reliance industries , and ratan tata , whose conglomerate 's interests include phone operator tata teleservices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's former communications and information technology minister a. raja in the taped conversations , niira radia was apparently pushing for a. raja , a south indian politician , to be reinstated as a minister .
as telecom minister before the election , raja had overseen the sale of the lucrative 2g phone licences at rock bottom prices - which is now turning out as potentially one of the biggest corruption cases in indian history .
it is estimated to have cost the exchequer over $ 35 billion in lost revenues .
transcripts of the 104 tapes , many of which have been printed by two news magazines , " open " and " outlook " , have called into question the reputations of , among others , celebrity anchor barkha dutt and veteran newspaper columnist vir sanghvi .
both deny any wrong-doings .
but hartosh singh bahl , the political editor of " open " , points out that there is a larger problem .
" the people who have been caught on tape are by no means the only ones who have been part of this cosy relationship .
this extends far beyond the few journalists who have been named or have been seen on tape .
whether it leads to a larger cleanup in the immediate future , i am not so sure .
there will be a certain sense of caution .

a controversy involving high-profile journalists and their taped telephone calls has given india its own wikileaks-style storm .
it has been termed the " radiagate " .
india 's own ' mediagate ' top journalists are heard in conversations with influential lobbyist niira radia after the 2009 general elections , discussing who should be in the next cabinet .
radia worked as a lobbyist for two of india 's biggest industrialists : mukesh ambani , head of reliance industries , and ratan tata , whose conglomerate 's interests include phone operator tata teleservices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's former communications and information technology minister a. raja in the taped conversations , niira radia was apparently pushing for a. raja , a south indian politician , to be reinstated as a minister .
as telecom minister before the election , raja had overseen the sale of the lucrative 2g phone licences at rock bottom prices - which is now turning out as potentially one of the biggest corruption cases in indian history .
it is estimated to have cost the exchequer over $ 35 billion in lost revenues .
transcripts of the 104 tapes , many of which have been printed by two news magazines , " open " and " outlook " , have called into question the reputations of , among others , celebrity anchor barkha dutt and veteran newspaper columnist vir sanghvi .
both deny any wrong-doings .
but hartosh singh bahl , the political editor of " open " , points out that there is a larger problem .
" the people who have been caught on tape are by no means the only ones who have been part of this cosy relationship .
this extends far beyond the few journalists who have been named or have been seen on tape .
whether it leads to a larger cleanup in the immediate future , i am not so sure .
there will be a certain sense of caution .
but till journalists as a whole try to organize themselves in a way , enforce a code of ethics in day-to-day work , i am not sure things will change in the long run . "

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

at least 500 schools will remain closed , while many hospital will close , a spokeswoman for the czech-moravian confederation of trade unions said .
some 100,000 civil servants are expected to go on strike , as well as around 40,000 people taking to the streets in czech towns and cities .
the center-right government of prime minister petr necas plans to cut public sector wage expenditure by 10 percent next year , as part of plans to cut the budget deficit .
the cabinet is aiming for a deficit of 4.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2011 , and then 3 percent by 2013 .
the government is already unpopular with labor unions after pushing through other changes in public sector wages which give more flexibility to employers .

some 100,000 civil servants are expected to go on strike , as well as around 40,000 people taking to the streets in czech towns and cities .
the center-right government of prime minister petr necas plans to cut public sector wage expenditure by 10 percent next year , as part of plans to cut the budget deficit .

he faces charges of manslaughter and robbery .
the controversial trial will shine a spotlight on turkey 's legal system . nearly 20 years after fleeing to germany from his native turkey , author dogan akhanli has gone before an istanbul courtroom on wednesday facing charges of robbery and manslaughter .
the 53-year-old akhanli , who has lived in germany since 1991 and holds german citizenship , is charged with involvement in an armed robbery at a currency exchange office in istanbul in 1989 .
his lawyers told the court they would seek an acquittal for their client , who , they said , had been blackmailed under torture and was the subject of a fabricated case .
a delegation of akhanli 's supporters has traveled to istanbul for the trial , among them german author guenter wallraff , who said earlier wednesday that akhanli had revoked statements allegedly given under torture .
" if due process is considered here , he must be released .
and i expect this to happen , " wallraff said .
" he is a colleague who has been innocently arrested . "
his publisher regip zarakoglu , meanwhile , said " they couldn ’ t punish akhanli for his writings , so they ’ re trying to pin another crime on him . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff called for akhanli 's immediate release germany 's foreign ministry is also expected to be closely watching the trial .
akhanli is receiving consular assistance , and the ministry is in contact with lawyers in cologne and istanbul , according to a spokesperson .
author 's perspective akhanli said earlier through his lawyer : " if i wasn ’ t being threatened with a life sentence , i ’ d have to laugh about my situation .
i feel like franz kafka ’ s tragic-hero josef k. , and not just because i ’ ve been arrested even though i ’ m innocent . "
the cologne-based political author was arrested on august 10 after returning to turkey for the first time since his escape to visit his ailing father who later died at the end of november without seeing his son .
since august , akhanli has been held in a prison in the province of tekirdag .
following his arrest , akhanli was also charged with a political offense , as prosecutors have said the crime was part of a move to destabilize the constitutional order in the country .
if convicted , he faces life in prison .
akhanli 's lawyer haydar erol has claimed the criminal charges are based on witness statements that were either fabricated or obtained through torture .
he said one witness , the son of the exchange office owner killed during the robbery , later disputed ever having identified akhanli in a photograph .
in addition , erol said akhanli 's fingerprints were never found at the scene .
" the scenario was produced by the police , " erol told german press agency dpa in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armenian massacre during world war i left few survivors a belated settling of accounts erol said the author 's arrest was a belated settling of accounts with the political left .
he has called for akhanli 's release and for the legal proceedings to be discontinued .
after the turkish military coup in 1980 , akhanli went underground and was arrested four years later for being a member of the revolutionary communist party of turkey -lrb- tdkp -rrb- .
he was imprisoned from 1985 to 1987 , during which time he said he was tortured .
living in cologne for the past two decades , akhanli , who has won awards in turkey and germany for his writing , has worked with the research association recherche international to uncover and study the genocides of the last century , in particular the ottoman empire 's massacre of armenians during world war i. his work has led some to believe he was targeted for writing on the topic .
it remains a sensitive subject in turkey , which has refused to classify the event as genocide .
' no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has refused to classify the armenian massacre as genocide akhanli 's arrest has led to demonstrations in germany and his supporters , among them amnesty international , fellow authors , intellectuals and politicians , plan to follow the trial closely .
" there is no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody , " said selami guerel , a friend and supporter .
" we expect that he will be released after the first day in court . "
the berlin academy of arts has called for international protests against akhanli 's arrest , and along with various european human rights organization and legal associations has demanded " freedom and justice .

they manage 6.3 billion dollars -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- worth of climate investment funds which are allocated to 43 countries .
deutsche welle interviewed andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , to find out what role the world bank wants to play in shaping future climate funding .
dw : what 's working well in the system of climate funding and what are the current flaws in the system ?
andrew steer : i think there 's a lot that is working well , but it 's not yet happening at the scale that is required .
we are the manager for example of the climate investment funds that we implement together with the regional development bank . the good thing about them is the leverage that they get .
by putting in relatively modest amounts of grant money , one can change the behavior of private investors in quite a good way .
so for example the biggest cif is the clean technology fund which is a 4 billion dollar fund .
as a result of that , there will be a total of 40 billion dollars of investment in clean technology .
so it 's a sort of ten to one ratio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steer says large-scale solar energy projects will generate revenue for developing countries .
unfortunately there will never be enough public grant money available to solve all the problems so the name of the game will be to make sure we get this degree of leverage where public funds , private funds and carbon market funds come together .
that 's an example of a positive story .
now overall it is true that some countries are finding that there are too many sources of funding and it 's all a bit complicated , so one of the things we did here in cancun was to launch a website together with undp -lsb- united nations development agency -rsb- that basically tries to untangle the spaghetti .
it will cut out a lot of the transaction costs that are normally associated with financing .
the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- which has played a very good role , is in need of overhaul .
delays are quite considerable , transaction costs are quite high , and predictability of the system is not what it needs to be .
and also money tends to go to a small number of middle income countries .
so we have been favoring reform of the cdm that would reduce costs , increase predictability and would extend the markets into low income countries .
dw : to what extent is the world bank best placed to manage climate investment funds ?
andrew steer : we are not seeking to fly our own flag .
we are simply offering to be helpful .
our speciality is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
we need to now get serious about the problem .
that requires an agency that can operate with large financial packages , engage with governments on monetary issues , bring together different types of finance and that has engagement across a range of sectors .
and we are privileged to have expertise and experience in those areas .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have protested against the world bank in cancun dw : you say you can play a helpful role .
if that 's the case , why are people in cancun demonstrating today against the world bank being in charge of climate assistance ?
andrew steer : i 'm not aware of them demonstrating against it .
views understandably differ .
that 's healthy .
we 're not for one moment suggesting that the world bank is uniquely qualified , but we do believe we have a very helpful role to play .
dw : a lot of this funding is actually loans .
tove ryding , a representative from greenpeace , has said that giving developing countries loans to help them deal with the consequences of climate change caused primarily by developed nations is " the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage . "
what do you say to that ?
andrew steer : this is for negotiators to decide .
that 's why we 're here in cancun .
it 's not the world bank that decides to make it loans rather than grants .
the world bank gives grants , but it also gives zero interest loans for some investments in renewable energy and some investments we give loans that have market based rates .
those decisions are made by the providers of funds and those are represented here by the parties .
i would make just one point and that is , the countries we are working in - and we are working in over 130 countries on climate change - are saying to us , ' we want to get on with it .
we want to be part of a green industrial revolution .
we want to make our economy grow rapidly in a climate resilient way and we want to have access to resources . '
it 's very encouraging because we 're seeing a lot of leadership in developing countries as they want to get on with things and if the choice is between a grant or a loan , you or i or anybody else would prefer a grant .
but that depends on whether or not the countries that are providing the funds want to provide them as grants .
if they do n't , then it 's very encouraging that , nonetheless , a lot of developing countries are getting on with it .
they do n't want to just talk about it .
they want to actually do it .
we believe that cancun really needs to deliver .
it 's possible , it could deliver something very important and we 're really hoping that in the next few days we 'll see that .

andrew steer : i 'm not aware of them demonstrating against it .
views understandably differ .
that 's healthy .
we 're not for one moment suggesting that the world bank is uniquely qualified , but we do believe we have a very helpful role to play .
dw : a lot of this funding is actually loans .
tove ryding , a representative from greenpeace , has said that giving developing countries loans to help them deal with the consequences of climate change caused primarily by developed nations is " the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage . "
what do you say to that ?
andrew steer : this is for negotiators to decide .
that 's why we 're here in cancun .
it 's not the world bank that decides to make it loans rather than grants .
the world bank gives grants , but it also gives zero interest loans for some investments in renewable energy and some investments we give loans that have market based rates .
those decisions are made by the providers of funds and those are represented here by the parties .
i would make just one point and that is , the countries we are working in - and we are working in over 130 countries on climate change - are saying to us , ' we want to get on with it .
we want to be part of a green industrial revolution .
we want to make our economy grow rapidly in a climate resilient way and we want to have access to resources . '
it 's very encouraging because we 're seeing a lot of leadership in developing countries as they want to get on with things and if the choice is between a grant or a loan , you or i or anybody else would prefer a grant .
but that depends on whether or not the countries that are providing the funds want to provide them as grants .
if they do n't , then it 's very encouraging that , nonetheless , a lot of developing countries are getting on with it .
they do n't want to just talk about it .
they want to actually do it .
we believe that cancun really needs to deliver .
it 's possible , it could deliver something very important and we 're really hoping that in the next few days we 'll see that .

researchers suggest children might be able to help their parents learn how to use the internet more effectively . on tuesday , the findings of a europe-wide study on young people and the internet were released in berlin .
more than 23,000 children and young people between the ages of nine and 16 were interviewed across 25 european countries .
the preliminary results of the study had been released in october .
according to the research , 12 percent of the young people interviewed said they were bothered or upset by something on the internet - which is a much lower number than the researchers expected .
surprisingly the top activity young people use the internet for is homework , closely followed by entertainment and games and communication .
klaus neumann-braun , a professor at the institute for media science at the university of basel in switzerland , noted that this study should go some way towards allaying the hysteria that accompanies many discussions around young people and the internet .
in germany young people spend 50 precent of their time communicating with their friends on the internet - creating their online profile , messaging friends and so on .
a window to the outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schuelervz.net remains a very popular social networking site in germany amongst school-age kids uwe hasebrink , chairman of the german part of the eu kids online network and director of the hans bredow institute for media research in hamburg said that young people have really embraced social networking sites , which has become an important part in social development and establishing their identities .
" they have to develop their position in the societal structure .
they have to come to know people .
they have to have experiences with others .
they have to build their identity , " he said , and added that for all these factors " the social web provides enormous possibilities " .
many young people are also increasingly resourceful in their use of the internet to solve everyday problems .
hasebrink described the situation of an 11-year-old afghan girl living in germany with her family that has strict cultural values .
" this girl told us that she writes a diary in a social networking site .
it is completely protected by a password .
she is the only person who can access her profile on this social networking site - nobody else - no friends " explained hasebrink .
he went on to say that the girl 's two older brothers keep a close watch over her and try to steer her away from the so-called " decadent western lifestyle , " and that her only chance to express her innermost thoughts is online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 48 percent of kids surveyed said they did not know how to change the privacy settings on sites like facebook but not every child is quite so media literate and innovative . the study also showed that 48 percent of young people do n't know how to change the privacy settings on their social networking profile , and 40 percent do n't know how to block messages from people they do n't want to have contact with .
cyberbullying threat remains low while the study found on average across the eu that bullying in real life was more prevalent than online , the polish data results surprised agnieszka wrzesien , project coordinator of the safer internet project in poland .
in the eu kids online study , five percent of polish kids reported that they had experienced cyberbullying , however the polish helpline has different figures .
they have reported yearly increases and in 2010 received 800 reports in 11 months .
wrzesien said that perhaps one reason for the discrepancy was a fear that if kids in poland mentioned cyberbullying , their parents might find out and restrict their internet or mobile phone access .
most social networking sites in poland have implemented a reporting mechanism , an abuse button , that allows children and young people to report if something bad is happening to them online .
however wrzesien said that even if they report it , this kind of problem takes time to resolve .
" within those couple of hours that the pictures may stay online , people may download them , may share them , they can be forwarded to other colleagues outside school and so on and this is a very distressing experience , " she said .
future policy recommendations in poland , wrzesien is working hard with schools and teachers in order to set up a system to prevent cyberbullying and to teach them how to respond to these incidents .
this system " would involve police , isp 's , psychologists and parents because it often happens that there needs to be police involved because the incident was so serious " , said wrzesien .
the german youth hotline called nummergegenkummer received over 20,000 calls in 2009 from kids who were having problems online .
beate friese from nummergegenkummer said that a big part of their work is teaching kids skills to resolve the problems themselves .
they also train young people to counsel other young people about problems they encounter online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study found that kids might be able to teach their parents , too parents need help , too but it 's not only kids that need help .
the study also highlights the fact that parents often have no idea what their kids are up to on the internet and do n't know how to help them if they have a problem .
some european authorities say that this problem could be alleviated if children teach their parents .
" -lsb- that will -rsb- not only bridge the gap in terms of technology , but will give them the opportunity to spend some time with their kids , " said dr. yiannis laouris , the head of the cyprus neuroscience & technology institute .
others , like uwe hasebrink , from hamburg , are calling for social networking sites to make the default setting for a user profile private .
that way , anyone can choose what he or she wants to make public .
hasebrink said that these initial findings will inform the researchers ' next steps which will be to work on correlational analysis and testing concrete hypothesis .
" so to what extent is risk experience or harm experience correlated with parental mediation ? " he said . " what is the role of school ?

he told deutsche welle that wikileaks unilaterally announced wikileaks.ch as the official domain name last week . wikileaks announced on friday on twitter that its new official domain name was wikileaks.ch , which is owned by the pirate party of switzerland .
like its counterparts around europe , the party stands for reform of copyright law , abolishing the patent system , the right to privacy , and other digital issues . wikileaks.ch forwards to wikileaks ' site , which is currently being hosted in france .
other european domain names , including wikileaks.de for germany , and wikileaks.fi for finland , also point to the new host .
to learn more about the relationship between the swiss pirate party and wikileaks , deutsche welle spoke with denis simonet , the party 's president . deutsche welle : when did you acquire the wikileaks.ch domain name and why did you decide to acquire it ? denis simonet : that was six months ago based on a request from the pirate party of switzerland .
wikileaks is one sign of a problem that has to be solved .
we are for free speech , free media .
the media has to safeguard the media and if they ca n't do it or do n't do it , then our democracy is in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switch , the swiss registrar , told simonet that there is no reason to block wikileaks.ch did you buy the domain as a measure of support for wikileaks , or did wikileaks ask you to do it ? we did so for ourselves .
we do n't host content anyway .
it 's just a re-direction to the servers .
there are many other servers that do the same .
you can just register a domain and forward it .
it 's no big issue .
we did n't ask to do it .
we just did it because a member thought that it was something the pirate party should do to show support . how did you come into contact with wikileaks and with julian assange ? that was a totally different story .
about three or four weeks ago , he announced in the press that he was seeking a request for political asylum in switzerland .
our board decided that because the reason that he has to request asylum is that he is the media spokesperson for wikileaks and that he is in danger now because he is the media spokesperson .
we thought that switzerland could position itself internationally as a place where freedom of media , freedom of opinion and information is of highly considered status .
that 's why i tried to get in contact with julian assange , so we could help him . the help was to inform him about how switzerland works , about how we have a direct democracy , our federal system of cantons .
i explained the political and administrate landscape in switzerland .
that was a big part of the discussion .
he just listened .
he did n't ask for help , he did n't say anything about whether it helps or if he will stay in switzerland or what his future plans are .
he just said " thank you , " and that 's it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange met with simonet in geneva in november what was he like ?
was he at ease ?
did he seem nervous ? he explained to us what the wikileaks philosophy is .
what he 's said in public is what he is .
he was exactly what i expected .
he has a cause and he wants this cause to be known by the world . did you mention that you had the wikileaks.ch domain name ? no , not at all .
wikileaks.ch was n't part of our discussion .
there was no agreement between us .
wikileaks decided unilaterally to communicate wikileaks.ch as the working , official domain name .
the redirection worked for six months and we did n't change anything .
we did n't get a notice .
we just saw the tweet and then the media began to run to us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks continues to be a thorn in the side of many governments around the world have you had any contact with any law enforcement from switzerland , or anywhere else in europe , or the united states ? no .
no one .
and we have n't had any contact with wikileaks , by the way .
we do n't have contact with them anymore , since that meeting . members of the american government have said that they want wikileaks to return the data it has released and to stop its operation .
are you surprised by the government reaction from the technical side ? no .
it 's well-known that sometimes governments do n't really know what they 're talking about when it comes to technical stuff .
that 's why we exist .
no one understands what digital politics means .
we are fighting to improve that situation - we are working to have digital politics for switzerland .
i think that it wo n't help if people know that we have wikileaks.ch , but it will help if we can start discussions about digital politics . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to learn more about the relationship between the swiss pirate party and wikileaks , deutsche welle spoke with denis simonet , the party 's president . deutsche welle : when did you acquire the wikileaks.ch domain name and why did you decide to acquire it ? denis simonet : that was six months ago based on a request from the pirate party of switzerland .
wikileaks is one sign of a problem that has to be solved .
we are for free speech , free media .
the media has to safeguard the media and if they ca n't do it or do n't do it , then our democracy is in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switch , the swiss registrar , told simonet that there is no reason to block wikileaks.ch did you buy the domain as a measure of support for wikileaks , or did wikileaks ask you to do it ? we did so for ourselves .
we do n't host content anyway .
it 's just a re-direction to the servers .
there are many other servers that do the same .
you can just register a domain and forward it .
it 's no big issue .
we did n't ask to do it .
we just did it because a member thought that it was something the pirate party should do to show support . how did you come into contact with wikileaks and with julian assange ? that was a totally different story .
about three or four weeks ago , he announced in the press that he was seeking a request for political asylum in switzerland .
our board decided that because the reason that he has to request asylum is that he is the media spokesperson for wikileaks and that he is in danger now because he is the media spokesperson .
we thought that switzerland could position itself internationally as a place where freedom of media , freedom of opinion and information is of highly considered status .
that 's why i tried to get in contact with julian assange , so we could help him . the help was to inform him about how switzerland works , about how we have a direct democracy , our federal system of cantons .
i explained the political and administrate landscape in switzerland .
that was a big part of the discussion .
he just listened .
he did n't ask for help , he did n't say anything about whether it helps or if he will stay in switzerland or what his future plans are .
he just said " thank you , " and that 's it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange met with simonet in geneva in november what was he like ?
was he at ease ?
did he seem nervous ? he explained to us what the wikileaks philosophy is .
what he 's said in public is what he is .
he was exactly what i expected .
he has a cause and he wants this cause to be known by the world . did you mention that you had the wikileaks.ch domain name ? no , not at all .
wikileaks.ch was n't part of our discussion .
there was no agreement between us .
wikileaks decided unilaterally to communicate wikileaks.ch as the working , official domain name .
the redirection worked for six months and we did n't change anything .
we did n't get a notice .
we just saw the tweet and then the media began to run to us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks continues to be a thorn in the side of many governments around the world have you had any contact with any law enforcement from switzerland , or anywhere else in europe , or the united states ? no .
no one .
and we have n't had any contact with wikileaks , by the way .
we do n't have contact with them anymore , since that meeting . members of the american government have said that they want wikileaks to return the data it has released and to stop its operation .
are you surprised by the government reaction from the technical side ? no .
it 's well-known that sometimes governments do n't really know what they 're talking about when it comes to technical stuff .
that 's why we exist .
no one understands what digital politics means .
we are fighting to improve that situation - we are working to have digital politics for switzerland .
i think that it wo n't help if people know that we have wikileaks.ch , but it will help if we can start discussions about digital politics . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 54-year old , who has dedicated his life to the fight for more civil rights in china , has been declared an enemy of the state . liu xiaobo has been known as one of the most prominent critics of the chinese regime for decades .
the civil rights activist has been in jail for nearly two years now .
this is not the first time that he has been locked up - the first time was after the bloody crackdown on the chinese democracy movement in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1989 : a student blocks a line of tanks near tiananmen square " i was on my bike home .
it was about midnight .
a car was following me and forced me to stop .
a couple of people came out , " liu recalled in a 2007 interview with deutsche welle .
" they blindfolded me , tied me up and pushed me into the car .
i was really scared .
i thought that they would take me somewhere and just shoot me . "
' duty ' to fight for justice liu xiaobo , who had studied literature , had taken the side of the chinese students fighting for more democracy on tiananmen square in 1989 .
after two years in jail , his will to fight was still not broken .
again , he was detained in 1995 and 1996 .
but he continued the struggle , explaining , " many innocent people were killed during the tiananmen massacre .
i believe that it is my duty to fight for justice to those who gave their lives .
it is a duty that i can not abandon , " he said .
charter ' 08 in late 2008 , liu xiaobo was arrested once more .
he had been one of the main initiators of the so-called ' charter ' 08 ' manifesto , which was published on the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights . the manifesto called for political reforms in china , including a system of checks and balances , freedom of speech and a competitive multi-party democracy .
as many as ten thousand intellectuals and academics have signed the petition so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo 's wife liu xia is under constant surveillance " many in his position would have given up .
but xiaobo has the mental strength .
if he believes in a goal , he 'll try to reach that goal by all means , even if he knows that he will never be able to reach it , " liu xia , his wife , had said in an interview .
" he can be really stubborn . "
she had had an uneasy feeling and sensed that the communist party would let her husband pay dearly for the charter ' 08 .
sentenced for ' subversion ' in december 2009 , a chinese court sentenced liu xiaobo to eleven years in jail on subversion charges .
in 2007 , he had already anticipated what could happen to him .
" i ’ ve once said that it is a dissident ’ s professional hazard to lose his freedom and being under surveillance .
it is part of a dissident ’ s job , " he told deutsche welle .
" it is your own choice .
you can do other things , be a salesman or a teacher , and earn easy money .
but as soon as you decide to be a dissident , you should withstand pressure with optimism , self-confidence and composure . "
committee defies china liu xiaobo is serving his sentence in a detention facility 500 kilometers northeast of beijing .
once a month he is allowed to receive visitors .
the chinese authorities have harshly protested against the pro-democracy activist receiving the nobel peace prize .
the executive secretary of the norwegian nobel committee geir lundestad reported that the chinese government explicitly threatened the committee not to give the prize to liu .
the decision would have a negative impact on chinese-norwegian relations , beijing said .
bildunterschrift : liu has been sentenced to eleven years in prison for ' subversive ' activities liu had also anticipated this kind of a move : " some european politicians fear that a discussion about human rights can have a negative impact on their economic relations with china .
i don ’ t think so .
the political relationship between china and japan is full of tensions .
but china 's trade relations with japan are among the largest with any country .
so you can see that both these two things do not have anything to do with each other . "

but there 's a gap - called the gigaton gap - between what governments have pledged and what climate researchers have said is needed . " if the voluntary commitments in copenhagen were to be implemented , " said achim steiner , director of the united nations environment program , at the cancun summit , " and i put the conditional on because none of us have a guarantee at the moment that they will be implemented , then we would be 60 percent of the way of where we need to be by 2020 in addressing a climate change action program that would allow the world to still have an opportunity to stay within the two degree range . " two-degree limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increase of more than two degrees celsius would have major effects on life on earth limiting global warming to two degrees will be crucial for avoiding its worst effects and may be the cut off point for us to have any chance of doing something about the problem of climate change , according to joseph alcamo , the united nations environment program 's chief scientist . " around two or two-and-a-half degrees would be roughly the level at which there would be an increasing frequency of extreme climate events , where there would be much higher risk of reaching tipping points in the climate system , " he told deutsche welle . to have a good chance of keeping warming below the two-degree level , the scientists behind a un emissions report presented in mexico said global emissions will need to peak at around 44 gigatonnes , or 44 billion tones , by the end of the decade . if no action is taken there would be a 12-gigaton gap between actual emissions and what 's needed to limit climate change to a two degree increase by 2020 .
that 's the equivalent of about 25 percent of current emissions .
but if countries fulfill their promises the gap would be seven gigatons , alcamo said . " we can go 60 percent of the way simply by fulfilling ambitions expressed in the copenhagen accord , " he said , pointing out that the most optimistic implementation of the copenhagen accord would leave the world five gigatons short of what researchers say is necessary . more to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more use of renewable energy sources could help cut the gigaton gap but even the current best-case scenario is pockmarked with caveats still up for negotiation .
issues including like an agreement on forestry , climate finance for developing countries as well as resisting tricky accounting rules that disguise increases in emissions as decreases are all yet to be decided on . policymakers will need to dig deeper and they 'll need to do it sooner rather than later since all models for keeping warming below two degrees have one thing in common , according to ramzi elias of the european climate foundation . " all of them that have a likely chance of limiting warming to two degrees have emissions levels that peaked and started to decline before 2020 , " he told deutsche welle .
" therefore , what we do over the next 10 years is really crucial . " leaving the big investments needed for a transition to a low carbon economy until after 2020 would likely be too late because of the cumulative nature of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , elias said . costly undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are already suffering the effects of climate change but if the costs seem steep now , closing the gap completely will likely be doubly expensive , according to michel den elzen of the netherlands ' environmental assessment agency .
he put the price tag for current copenhagen promises at between $ 60 billion and $ 100 billion . " to close the gap , i think it is in the order of 0.3 percent of the worldwide gdp , " he told deutsche welle , adding that it would be equal to about $ 200 billion . uk climate secretary chris huhne , however , said the costs of inaction were even higher , pointing out that the extreme weather events of 2010 were a taste of things to come . " anybody who is any doubt about that please go and talk to the big insurance companies , because they are paying out for this , " he said . " just in the uk alone over the last 10 years , the payout for flooding was 4.5 billion pounds , whereas in the 10 years before that it was 1.5 billion pounds .
this is hard business evidence of the costs that are being inflicted on our economies and we have to tackle this problem .

" this is a wake-up call because now it is out in the open .
it concerns a few people in the media but unfortunately these people are of high profile .
and i think a large number of people in the media are conscientious regarding their business and this should help them realize what they should not do .
i think sometimes what they should not do is more important than what they should do , " dipankar gupta argues .
the controversy is far from over and could possibly mark a new chapter in indian journalism .

a new unicef report finds that most kids attach great importance to family cohesion , friendship and trust . a survey compiled on behalf of unicef and officially released in berlin on wednesday takes a closer look at which social values six to 14-year-old kids in germany cherish the most . information gathered in 1,500 interviews has led the authors of the study to conclude that the vast majority of children are very highly value-oriented .
" we do n't see any decline in values in this age group as some scientists want to make us believe , " said professor hans bertram from berlin 's humboldt university during the presentation of the survey .
" values such as mutual trust , and increasingly also respect for other people 's opinions and life experiences , are extremely important for children here . "
family as a safe haven bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german children 's values are not declining , says the unicef team other qualities that rank high in the value system of the young are reliability , a sense of belonging , and honesty .
far less important for those polled appear to be money and religious faith .
but what counts most for children is family cohesion , the study says .
" of course , many kids do have problems with their parents once in a while , " said gerd bruene from the geo publishing house which was involved in the survey .
" but the kids want to feel safe and protected , and they clearly associate this with their families . "
working parents are not a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when parents are away , the children can play the study also reveals that most children here have learned to deal with the fact that many parents – increasingly also mothers – have to stay away from home for a long period to pursue their jobs .
but they enjoy the time they can spend together with their parents who are credited with largely keeping job-related problems away from the kids .
" the kids feel that there 's often a lack of time for working mothers to spend with them , " said sociologist hans bertram .
" but many youngsters also feel they have more freedom to pursue their own activities while their mothers are away . "
german children fully accept the primary role of both parents and teachers to instill values of social behavior in them . only a small proportion would make use of the media for this , and even fewer care about what religious leaders or politicians tell them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.12.2010 german government proposes tougher laws for tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just filing backtaxes and an apology might not cut the mustard anymore germany 's cabinet has published a draft law designed to get tough on tax evaders and money launderers .
the new law is supposed to make it harder for tax dodgers to admit their crimes themselves , thus avoiding a trial . the german cabinet on wednesday finalized new draft legislation on tax evasion , as it attempts to close some of the loop holes that allow tax dodgers to avoid prosecution once authorities get wind of their misdemeanors .
the draft bill by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble would make it more difficult for offenders to dodge legal proceedings by preemptively admitting their guilt and paying back taxes .
under current german law , people can avoid a trial by issuing a so-called " voluntary disclosure , " detailing the taxes they have skipped and paying them with 6 percent interest - provided they do so before they are officially prosecuted .
tax evaders can still file a voluntary disclosure after being notified that their assets are under investigation , but the deadline would change under the proposed legislation , meaning that once you have been warned , it 's too late to confess .
" these prosecution-avoiding voluntary disclosures will therefore no longer be effective as part of a calculated tax evasion strategy , " the financial policy spokesman for the christian democratic union , leo dautzenberg , said in an interview with the newspaper die welt .
some german tax dodgers have been abusing this legal loop hole by deliberately waiting until they received their pro-forma warning , and then declaring their assets .
full disclosure the new draft law would also make voluntary disclosures valid only if tax dodgers comprehensively admit to all the assets they have failed to declare that have not become legally outdated .
" people submitting voluntary disclosures will only be immune to proseuction if they completely and accurately disclose information on all assets that qualify for any form of tax , " a government statement says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent government purchase of stolen bank data prompted the debate but of course , the tax authorities would first have to find any withheld funds or assets in order to make a case .
germany recently registered a wave of almost 30,000 voluntary admissions after purchasing cds containing stolen data on foreign bank accounts held by german citizens , as people realized the information might incriminate them .
" our experiences with the flood of voluntary disclosures after the debate over the purchase of tax data highlighted the need to change our legal system and limit the ways in which tax evaders can avoid prosecution , " the budgetary and financial spokesman for the christian social union , bartholomaeus kalb , told parliament on wednesday .
too little , too late ?
however , the proposed changes would represent only a slight tightening of germany 's already lax tax evasion laws , and critics have derided the draft law as a " mini-solution " by a center-right coalition government that does n't want to get too tough on the subject .
" the coalition has become nervous because of the public outcry over the case of the swiss bank data cds , " the chairman of the german union of tax workers , dieter ondracek , told deutsche welle .
" that made ordinary citizens aware of the possibility of submitting a voluntary disclosure , and they were unhappy with the law . "
" the politicians do n't really want to address the issue , because they see revenue from these disclosures as money in the bank , without any messy litigation . "
ondracek , however , believes that it would be better to get rid of voluntary disclosures altogether , arguing the german approach to tax evasion implies that it 's not really considered a crime .
" it 's not just important , it 's a matter of urgency , " ondracek said .
" this possibility only exists for one crime - tax evasion .
how can a crime be serious if you can absolve yourself of legal responsibility at the last minute just by owning up ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister schaeuble could do with the extra cash " in reality , tax evasion is comparable with embezzlement or theft , except you 're not stealing from one person , you 're stealing from every german citizen .
remember , this is a problem that costs our government and taxpayers an absolute minimum of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.2 billion -rrb- per year . "
wasted chance to tackle the deficit ?
that 10 billion euro bottom estimate would represent just under one fifth of the money the heavily indebted german government plans to borrow in 2011 .
missing taxes do not become legally out-dated for 10 years , meaning that german tax dodgers currently owe at least 100 billion euros .
" it would make more sense to try to balance the budget by doing everything we can to secure these missing taxes that people are legally obliged to pay the government , " ondracek said .
" instead , we 're taking out more loans and passing on the interest to our grandchildren . "
the opposition social democrats had also advocated abolishing the voluntary disclosure system altogether , in favor of letting the courts decide whether or not tax evaders deserved to avoid jail sentences or other legal punishments .
" the legal procedure involving voluntary disclosures has existed in germany for 90 years now , " kalb of the christian social union countered .

if talks in cancun fail , he will go on with his struggle . just a few weeks ago , chen faqing turned up at the mexican embassy in beijing .
he told the officials there he wanted to donate 250,000 yuan to the climate summit in cancun – with no conditions .
the embassy officials were a little skeptical at first but then the money was transferred – exactly 37,022 dollars and 21 cents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming has an increasing effect on the arctic region with glaciers shrinking chen said it was money well spent : " we only have this world .
some countries are only thinking of economic development and their national interest .
but that will harm all humanity .
protecting the earth has to be a priority . "
chen has already used up a good deal of his savings for his crusade .
he has donated 40,000 us dollars to the secretariat of the intergovernmental panel on climate change in geneva and he has taken out ads in the international press , such as the wall street journal and the economist , too .
" i hope that thanks to my advertisements all the governments will understand what a catastrophe climate change is .
the chinese people 's newspaper refused to print my ad , saying it could lead to diplomatic pressure , " he said .
activism triggered by local water pollution in his adverts , chen presents himself as a disabled farmer although this is only partly true .
however , he is very hard of hearing .
he started off poor but worked his way up – rearing poultry and cattle and making various investments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate during the un climate summit in cancun he first became interested in the environment at the end of the 1990s as more and more people in his village started contracting lung disease .
he was concerned that the rivers were being polluted by the local factories .
for years , chen tried in vain to pressure the local authorities into acting against the pollution .
he then tried to sue them ; then he tried to sue the environment ministry in beijing , and even prime minister wen jiabao but all in vain .
everybody has to work together " the government has to bear more responsibility regarding greenhouse gases .
the world will only be saved if everybody does something , " he insisted .
he said he refused to give up his fight , even if no deal was reached in cancun : " next year , i will continue taking out adverts in the international media and i will donate money to support further climate talks . "
the mexican government had arranged for chen to be present in cancun , like all big donors but he refused .
he says he ca n't speak english .
moreover , he was urgently needed at home in his village – his wife had hoped he would spend his life savings on building a new house , not on saving the planet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo opinion -pipe- 08.12.2010 opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange is in custody in the uk , over swedish charges of sexual misconduct .
deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

satisfying , yet meaningless win bremen 's 3-0 win over the defending champions inter milan , while significant , was ultimately meaningless .
with tottenham hotspur drawing 3-3 at twente to win group a , inter progresses to the knockout stage as runners-up , leaving bremen to enjoy their first , and only , win on their way out of the competition .

they hope to go back to their country armed with the skills to take up leading positions in ministries or in non-governmental organizations . since 2008 , a number of young afghans have been coming to study at the willy brandt school of public policy at the university of erfurt in central germany .
they learn how to govern countries effectively .
the students have an ambitious goal : to build a peaceful , democratic state in afghanistan , and to rid the country of terror and violence .
in the future , these students hope to form the afghan elite , to find jobs in government ministries or ngos .
after a six-month preparatory program entitled " good governance in afghanistan , " the students are ready to begin a masters course in public policy .
high hopes and clear ambitions moheb jarbakhail is one of 27 young afghans at the willy brandt school .
the 25-year-old says he wants to return to kabul at the end of his course , armed with skills he has learned .
" people like myself can make a significant difference to afghanistan for two reasons , " moheb told deutsche welle .

a lecturer on the course , kristina roepstorff , has had endless debates with her students , about whether western-style democracy can function in countries like afghanistan .
" some of them strongly rejected the idea of democracy at first , " roepstoff said .
" over time they 've learnt that there are various types of democracy .
they can see it 's a system that makes sense , and that could settle ethnic conflicts . "

she 's received 120 applications for next year 's course , although there are just 10 places .
applicants need to bring with them excellent marks , a strong knowledge of english , and political experience .
however not every afghan politician is behind the idea of the germans forging their elite .
" on a political level of course some of the ministries are skeptical , " spanta said .
" they say : ' ok , they 're being trained over there .
but can they really use what they 've learned in germany ? '
the thing is though , afghanistan needs these capabilities . "
hope of the nation in some senses , the young afghans are carrying the weight of their home country on their shoulders .
moheb jarbakhail feels the pressure , but is ambitious and hopeful about the future : " i would like to succeed , " he said .
" i would like to use this opportunity that is given to me to be a knowledgeable person and that pressure is from within and that is one of the motivations that has brought me here to germany . "

can western democracy work in afghanistan ?
a lecturer on the course , kristina roepstorff , has had endless debates with her students , about whether western-style democracy can function in countries like afghanistan .
" some of them strongly rejected the idea of democracy at first , " roepstoff said .
" over time they 've learnt that there are various types of democracy .
they can see it 's a system that makes sense , and that could settle ethnic conflicts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frangis spanta is looking for the best applicants the course is partly financed by the german foreign ministry , and the students also get a grant from the german academic exchange sercive -lrb- daad -rrb- .
frangis spanta , the daughter of a former afghan foreign minister coordinates the masters program .
she 's received 120 applications for next year 's course , although there are just 10 places .
applicants need to bring with them excellent marks , a strong knowledge of english , and political experience .
however not every afghan politician is behind the idea of the germans forging their elite .
" on a political level of course some of the ministries are skeptical , " spanta said .
" they say : ' ok , they 're being trained over there .
but can they really use what they 've learned in germany ? '
the thing is though , afghanistan needs these capabilities . "
hope of the nation in some senses , the young afghans are carrying the weight of their home country on their shoulders .
moheb jarbakhail feels the pressure , but is ambitious and hopeful about the future : " i would like to succeed , " he said .
" i would like to use this opportunity that is given to me to be a knowledgeable person and that pressure is from within and that is one of the motivations that has brought me here to germany . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 08.12.2010 music hotel brings new beat to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the trendy hotel class with berlin 's indigenous underground music scene ?
berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .
" it 's a different mentality .
that 's also what makes the city unique - that so many different cultures coexist . " author : rebecca schmid editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .
" it 's a different mentality .
that 's also what makes the city unique - that so many different cultures coexist . " author : rebecca schmid editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.12.2010 german government proposes tougher laws for tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just filing backtaxes and an apology might not cut the mustard anymore germany 's cabinet has published a draft law designed to get tough on tax evaders and money launderers .
the new law is supposed to make it harder for tax dodgers to admit their crimes themselves , thus avoiding a trial . the german cabinet on wednesday finalized new draft legislation on tax evasion , as it attempts to close some of the loop holes that allow tax dodgers to avoid prosecution once authorities get wind of their misdemeanors .
the draft bill by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble would make it more difficult for offenders to dodge legal proceedings by preemptively admitting their guilt and paying back taxes .
under current german law , people can avoid a trial by issuing a so-called " voluntary disclosure , " detailing the taxes they have skipped and paying them with 6 percent interest - provided they do so before they are officially prosecuted .
tax evaders can still file a voluntary disclosure after being notified that their assets are under investigation , but the deadline would change under the proposed legislation , meaning that once you have been warned , it 's too late to confess .
" these prosecution-avoiding voluntary disclosures will therefore no longer be effective as part of a calculated tax evasion strategy , " the financial policy spokesman for the christian democratic union , leo dautzenberg , said in an interview with the newspaper die welt .
some german tax dodgers have been abusing this legal loop hole by deliberately waiting until they received their pro-forma warning , and then declaring their assets .
full disclosure the new draft law would also make voluntary disclosures valid only if tax dodgers comprehensively admit to all the assets they have failed to declare that have not become legally outdated .
" people submitting voluntary disclosures will only be immune to proseuction if they completely and accurately disclose information on all assets that qualify for any form of tax , " a government statement says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent government purchase of stolen bank data prompted the debate but of course , the tax authorities would first have to find any withheld funds or assets in order to make a case .
germany recently registered a wave of almost 30,000 voluntary admissions after purchasing cds containing stolen data on foreign bank accounts held by german citizens , as people realized the information might incriminate them .
" our experiences with the flood of voluntary disclosures after the debate over the purchase of tax data highlighted the need to change our legal system and limit the ways in which tax evaders can avoid prosecution , " the budgetary and financial spokesman for the christian social union , bartholomaeus kalb , told parliament on wednesday .
too little , too late ?
however , the proposed changes would represent only a slight tightening of germany 's already lax tax evasion laws , and critics have derided the draft law as a " mini-solution " by a center-right coalition government that does n't want to get too tough on the subject .
" the coalition has become nervous because of the public outcry over the case of the swiss bank data cds , " the chairman of the german union of tax workers , dieter ondracek , told deutsche welle .
" that made ordinary citizens aware of the possibility of submitting a voluntary disclosure , and they were unhappy with the law . "
" the politicians do n't really want to address the issue , because they see revenue from these disclosures as money in the bank , without any messy litigation . "
ondracek , however , believes that it would be better to get rid of voluntary disclosures altogether , arguing the german approach to tax evasion implies that it 's not really considered a crime .
" it 's not just important , it 's a matter of urgency , " ondracek said .
" this possibility only exists for one crime - tax evasion .
how can a crime be serious if you can absolve yourself of legal responsibility at the last minute just by owning up ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister schaeuble could do with the extra cash " in reality , tax evasion is comparable with embezzlement or theft , except you 're not stealing from one person , you 're stealing from every german citizen .
remember , this is a problem that costs our government and taxpayers an absolute minimum of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.2 billion -rrb- per year . "
wasted chance to tackle the deficit ?
that 10 billion euro bottom estimate would represent just under one fifth of the money the heavily indebted german government plans to borrow in 2011 .
missing taxes do not become legally out-dated for 10 years , meaning that german tax dodgers currently owe at least 100 billion euros .
" it would make more sense to try to balance the budget by doing everything we can to secure these missing taxes that people are legally obliged to pay the government , " ondracek said .
" instead , we 're taking out more loans and passing on the interest to our grandchildren . "
the opposition social democrats had also advocated abolishing the voluntary disclosure system altogether , in favor of letting the courts decide whether or not tax evaders deserved to avoid jail sentences or other legal punishments .
" the legal procedure involving voluntary disclosures has existed in germany for 90 years now , " kalb of the christian social union countered .
" it has proved its worth and remains a useful mechanism .
abolishing this system , as per the -lsb- social democrats ' -rsb- suggestion , would be unwise . "

if talks in cancun fail , he will go on with his struggle . just a few weeks ago , chen faqing turned up at the mexican embassy in beijing .
he told the officials there he wanted to donate 250,000 yuan to the climate summit in cancun – with no conditions .
the embassy officials were a little skeptical at first but then the money was transferred – exactly 37,022 dollars and 21 cents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming has an increasing effect on the arctic region with glaciers shrinking chen said it was money well spent : " we only have this world .
some countries are only thinking of economic development and their national interest .
but that will harm all humanity .
protecting the earth has to be a priority . "
chen has already used up a good deal of his savings for his crusade .
he has donated 40,000 us dollars to the secretariat of the intergovernmental panel on climate change in geneva and he has taken out ads in the international press , such as the wall street journal and the economist , too .
" i hope that thanks to my advertisements all the governments will understand what a catastrophe climate change is .
the chinese people 's newspaper refused to print my ad , saying it could lead to diplomatic pressure , " he said .
activism triggered by local water pollution in his adverts , chen presents himself as a disabled farmer although this is only partly true .
however , he is very hard of hearing .
he started off poor but worked his way up – rearing poultry and cattle and making various investments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate during the un climate summit in cancun he first became interested in the environment at the end of the 1990s as more and more people in his village started contracting lung disease .
he was concerned that the rivers were being polluted by the local factories .
for years , chen tried in vain to pressure the local authorities into acting against the pollution .
he then tried to sue them ; then he tried to sue the environment ministry in beijing , and even prime minister wen jiabao but all in vain .
everybody has to work together " the government has to bear more responsibility regarding greenhouse gases .
the world will only be saved if everybody does something , " he insisted .
he said he refused to give up his fight , even if no deal was reached in cancun : " next year , i will continue taking out adverts in the international media and i will donate money to support further climate talks . "
the mexican government had arranged for chen to be present in cancun , like all big donors but he refused .
he says he ca n't speak english .
moreover , he was urgently needed at home in his village – his wife had hoped he would spend his life savings on building a new house , not on saving the planet .

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 08.12.2010 manslaughter trial of turkish-german author opens in istanbul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akhanli has been a political refugee in germany since 1991 the trial of a turkish-german author living as a political refugee in cologne has begun in istanbul .
he faces charges of manslaughter and robbery .
the controversial trial will shine a spotlight on turkey 's legal system . nearly 20 years after fleeing to germany from his native turkey , author dogan akhanli has gone before an istanbul courtroom on wednesday facing charges of robbery and manslaughter .
the 53-year-old akhanli , who has lived in germany since 1991 and holds german citizenship , is charged with involvement in an armed robbery at a currency exchange office in istanbul in 1989 .
his lawyers told the court they would seek an acquittal for their client , who , they said , had been blackmailed under torture and was the subject of a fabricated case .
a delegation of akhanli 's supporters has traveled to istanbul for the trial , among them german author guenter wallraff , who said earlier wednesday that akhanli had revoked statements allegedly given under torture .
" if due process is considered here , he must be released .
and i expect this to happen , " wallraff said .
" he is a colleague who has been innocently arrested . "
his publisher regip zarakoglu , meanwhile , said " they couldn ’ t punish akhanli for his writings , so they ’ re trying to pin another crime on him . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff called for akhanli 's immediate release germany 's foreign ministry is also expected to be closely watching the trial .
akhanli is receiving consular assistance , and the ministry is in contact with lawyers in cologne and istanbul , according to a spokesperson .
author 's perspective akhanli said earlier through his lawyer : " if i wasn ’ t being threatened with a life sentence , i ’ d have to laugh about my situation .
i feel like franz kafka ’ s tragic-hero josef k. , and not just because i ’ ve been arrested even though i ’ m innocent . "
the cologne-based political author was arrested on august 10 after returning to turkey for the first time since his escape to visit his ailing father who later died at the end of november without seeing his son .
since august , akhanli has been held in a prison in the province of tekirdag .
following his arrest , akhanli was also charged with a political offense , as prosecutors have said the crime was part of a move to destabilize the constitutional order in the country .
if convicted , he faces life in prison .
akhanli 's lawyer haydar erol has claimed the criminal charges are based on witness statements that were either fabricated or obtained through torture .
he said one witness , the son of the exchange office owner killed during the robbery , later disputed ever having identified akhanli in a photograph .
in addition , erol said akhanli 's fingerprints were never found at the scene .
" the scenario was produced by the police , " erol told german press agency dpa in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the armenian massacre during world war i left few survivors a belated settling of accounts erol said the author 's arrest was a belated settling of accounts with the political left .
he has called for akhanli 's release and for the legal proceedings to be discontinued .
after the turkish military coup in 1980 , akhanli went underground and was arrested four years later for being a member of the revolutionary communist party of turkey -lrb- tdkp -rrb- .
he was imprisoned from 1985 to 1987 , during which time he said he was tortured .
living in cologne for the past two decades , akhanli , who has won awards in turkey and germany for his writing , has worked with the research association recherche international to uncover and study the genocides of the last century , in particular the ottoman empire 's massacre of armenians during world war i. his work has led some to believe he was targeted for writing on the topic .
it remains a sensitive subject in turkey , which has refused to classify the event as genocide .
' no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has refused to classify the armenian massacre as genocide akhanli 's arrest has led to demonstrations in germany and his supporters , among them amnesty international , fellow authors , intellectuals and politicians , plan to follow the trial closely .
" there is no valid reason to keep akhanli in custody , " said selami guerel , a friend and supporter .
" we expect that he will be released after the first day in court . "
the berlin academy of arts has called for international protests against akhanli 's arrest , and along with various european human rights organization and legal associations has demanded " freedom and justice .

a new unicef report finds that most kids attach great importance to family cohesion , friendship and trust . a survey compiled on behalf of unicef and officially released in berlin on wednesday takes a closer look at which social values six to 14-year-old kids in germany cherish the most . information gathered in 1,500 interviews has led the authors of the study to conclude that the vast majority of children are very highly value-oriented .
" we do n't see any decline in values in this age group as some scientists want to make us believe , " said professor hans bertram from berlin 's humboldt university during the presentation of the survey .
" values such as mutual trust , and increasingly also respect for other people 's opinions and life experiences , are extremely important for children here . "
family as a safe haven bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german children 's values are not declining , says the unicef team other qualities that rank high in the value system of the young are reliability , a sense of belonging , and honesty .
far less important for those polled appear to be money and religious faith .
but what counts most for children is family cohesion , the study says .
" of course , many kids do have problems with their parents once in a while , " said gerd bruene from the geo publishing house which was involved in the survey .
" but the kids want to feel safe and protected , and they clearly associate this with their families . "
working parents are not a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when parents are away , the children can play the study also reveals that most children here have learned to deal with the fact that many parents – increasingly also mothers – have to stay away from home for a long period to pursue their jobs .
but they enjoy the time they can spend together with their parents who are credited with largely keeping job-related problems away from the kids .
" the kids feel that there 's often a lack of time for working mothers to spend with them , " said sociologist hans bertram .
" but many youngsters also feel they have more freedom to pursue their own activities while their mothers are away . "
german children fully accept the primary role of both parents and teachers to instill values of social behavior in them . only a small proportion would make use of the media for this , and even fewer care about what religious leaders or politicians tell them .

the row has been brewing since monday , when germany flatly rejected on legal and economic grounds a proposal by juncker for joint eurozone bonds .
in an article to be published thursday in german weekly die zeit , juncker labeled the german reaction as " un-european , " and attacked the government of chancellor angela merkel for not taking a proper look at his proposal - aimed at helping weaker eurozone countries like greece , ireland and portugal raise money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says germany is being un-european " they are rejecting an idea before studying it ...
this way of creating taboo areas in europe and not dealing with others ' ideas is a very un-european way of dealing with european matters , " said juncker , who is also luxembourg 's prime minister .
" germany is thinking a bit simple on that , " he added .
the joint bonds - or e-bonds - could help eurozone members seen as having unstable public finances lower their borrowing costs .
as it stands , the interest that weaker eurozone states must pay out on government bonds stands at more than double - and sometimes triple - the interest paid by stronger members , such as germany .
it is believed such high interest rates for irish and greek bonds contributed to both countries having to seek huge loans from the eu and international monetary fund recently - 110 billion euros and 85 billion euros respectively .
german reaction merkel retorted to juncker 's comments on his e-bond proposal by saying his words were causing unease on world markets .
the yield on a 10-year german government bond recently shot up to 3 percent from 2.4 percent in early november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says juncker 's comments are causing market instability " it does n't help anyone in europe if european figures call each other un-european , " commented merkel 's spokesman steffen seibert in a regular government briefing .
" it is exactly this talking against other people and about other people which should stop , because the markets definitely see this finger-pointing as a sign of discord . "
" the german government remains opposed to the proposal .
the legal and economic concerns about the euro bonds will remain in place for the weeks ahead , " he added .
merkel herself called for " calm " ahead of an eu leaders ' summit next friday , where talks will focus on creating a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone and what the chancellor called " narrow " changes to eu treaties .
" i think that we should work in a calm and goal-oriented manner towards what awaits us next friday .
this calm manner is my contribution to making sure we are successful next friday , " merkel told reporters .

berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .
" it 's a different mentality .
that 's also what makes the city unique - that so many different cultures coexist . " author : rebecca schmid editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 08.12.2010 ' radiagate ' provokes soul-searching among indian journalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corporate lobbyist niira radia is being questioned by law enforcement agencies leaked recordings of phone conversations with a lobbyist have raised suspicions that some of india 's most influential journalists served as power brokers for a deal that is considered one of india 's biggest scams ever . the revelations have shocked the public and upset the media world .
a controversy involving high-profile journalists and their taped telephone calls has given india its own wikileaks-style storm .
it has been termed the " radiagate " .
india 's own ' mediagate ' top journalists are heard in conversations with influential lobbyist niira radia after the 2009 general elections , discussing who should be in the next cabinet .
radia worked as a lobbyist for two of india 's biggest industrialists : mukesh ambani , head of reliance industries , and ratan tata , whose conglomerate 's interests include phone operator tata teleservices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's former communications and information technology minister a. raja in the taped conversations , niira radia was apparently pushing for a. raja , a south indian politician , to be reinstated as a minister .
as telecom minister before the election , raja had overseen the sale of the lucrative 2g phone licences at rock bottom prices - which is now turning out as potentially one of the biggest corruption cases in indian history .
it is estimated to have cost the exchequer over $ 35 billion in lost revenues .
transcripts of the 104 tapes , many of which have been printed by two news magazines , " open " and " outlook " , have called into question the reputations of , among others , celebrity anchor barkha dutt and veteran newspaper columnist vir sanghvi .
both deny any wrong-doings .
but hartosh singh bahl , the political editor of " open " , points out that there is a larger problem .
" the people who have been caught on tape are by no means the only ones who have been part of this cosy relationship .
this extends far beyond the few journalists who have been named or have been seen on tape .
whether it leads to a larger cleanup in the immediate future , i am not so sure .
there will be a certain sense of caution .
but till journalists as a whole try to organize themselves in a way , enforce a code of ethics in day-to-day work , i am not sure things will change in the long run . "
time for introspection eminent sociologist dipankar gupta agrees that there is a need for serious introspection by the mainstream media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' radiagate ' controversy has caused a heated debate about media ethics " the lesson that the media should learn is that they are really judged in the court of the people .
and what they do must not only seem legal but also proper .
and over the years they have become a little complacent because of their closeness with powerful people , the rich and the powerful . "
the controversy has caused heated debates among journalists , in press clubs and other forums .
" this is a wake-up call because now it is out in the open .
it concerns a few people in the media but unfortunately these people are of high profile .
and i think a large number of people in the media are conscientious regarding their business and this should help them realize what they should not do .
i think sometimes what they should not do is more important than what they should do , " dipankar gupta argues .
the controversy is far from over and could possibly mark a new chapter in indian journalism .

but there 's a gap - called the gigaton gap - between what governments have pledged and what climate researchers have said is needed . " if the voluntary commitments in copenhagen were to be implemented , " said achim steiner , director of the united nations environment program , at the cancun summit , " and i put the conditional on because none of us have a guarantee at the moment that they will be implemented , then we would be 60 percent of the way of where we need to be by 2020 in addressing a climate change action program that would allow the world to still have an opportunity to stay within the two degree range . " two-degree limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increase of more than two degrees celsius would have major effects on life on earth limiting global warming to two degrees will be crucial for avoiding its worst effects and may be the cut off point for us to have any chance of doing something about the problem of climate change , according to joseph alcamo , the united nations environment program 's chief scientist . " around two or two-and-a-half degrees would be roughly the level at which there would be an increasing frequency of extreme climate events , where there would be much higher risk of reaching tipping points in the climate system , " he told deutsche welle . to have a good chance of keeping warming below the two-degree level , the scientists behind a un emissions report presented in mexico said global emissions will need to peak at around 44 gigatonnes , or 44 billion tones , by the end of the decade . if no action is taken there would be a 12-gigaton gap between actual emissions and what 's needed to limit climate change to a two degree increase by 2020 .
that 's the equivalent of about 25 percent of current emissions .
but if countries fulfill their promises the gap would be seven gigatons , alcamo said . " we can go 60 percent of the way simply by fulfilling ambitions expressed in the copenhagen accord , " he said , pointing out that the most optimistic implementation of the copenhagen accord would leave the world five gigatons short of what researchers say is necessary . more to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more use of renewable energy sources could help cut the gigaton gap but even the current best-case scenario is pockmarked with caveats still up for negotiation .
issues including like an agreement on forestry , climate finance for developing countries as well as resisting tricky accounting rules that disguise increases in emissions as decreases are all yet to be decided on . policymakers will need to dig deeper and they 'll need to do it sooner rather than later since all models for keeping warming below two degrees have one thing in common , according to ramzi elias of the european climate foundation . " all of them that have a likely chance of limiting warming to two degrees have emissions levels that peaked and started to decline before 2020 , " he told deutsche welle .
" therefore , what we do over the next 10 years is really crucial . " leaving the big investments needed for a transition to a low carbon economy until after 2020 would likely be too late because of the cumulative nature of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , elias said . costly undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are already suffering the effects of climate change but if the costs seem steep now , closing the gap completely will likely be doubly expensive , according to michel den elzen of the netherlands ' environmental assessment agency .
he put the price tag for current copenhagen promises at between $ 60 billion and $ 100 billion . " to close the gap , i think it is in the order of 0.3 percent of the worldwide gdp , " he told deutsche welle , adding that it would be equal to about $ 200 billion . uk climate secretary chris huhne , however , said the costs of inaction were even higher , pointing out that the extreme weather events of 2010 were a taste of things to come . " anybody who is any doubt about that please go and talk to the big insurance companies , because they are paying out for this , " he said . " just in the uk alone over the last 10 years , the payout for flooding was 4.5 billion pounds , whereas in the 10 years before that it was 1.5 billion pounds .
this is hard business evidence of the costs that are being inflicted on our economies and we have to tackle this problem .

the 54-year old , who has dedicated his life to the fight for more civil rights in china , has been declared an enemy of the state . liu xiaobo has been known as one of the most prominent critics of the chinese regime for decades .
the civil rights activist has been in jail for nearly two years now .
this is not the first time that he has been locked up - the first time was after the bloody crackdown on the chinese democracy movement in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1989 : a student blocks a line of tanks near tiananmen square " i was on my bike home .
it was about midnight .
a car was following me and forced me to stop .
a couple of people came out , " liu recalled in a 2007 interview with deutsche welle .
" they blindfolded me , tied me up and pushed me into the car .
i was really scared .
i thought that they would take me somewhere and just shoot me . "
' duty ' to fight for justice liu xiaobo , who had studied literature , had taken the side of the chinese students fighting for more democracy on tiananmen square in 1989 .
after two years in jail , his will to fight was still not broken .
again , he was detained in 1995 and 1996 .
but he continued the struggle , explaining , " many innocent people were killed during the tiananmen massacre .
i believe that it is my duty to fight for justice to those who gave their lives .
it is a duty that i can not abandon , " he said .
charter ' 08 in late 2008 , liu xiaobo was arrested once more .
he had been one of the main initiators of the so-called ' charter ' 08 ' manifesto , which was published on the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights . the manifesto called for political reforms in china , including a system of checks and balances , freedom of speech and a competitive multi-party democracy .
as many as ten thousand intellectuals and academics have signed the petition so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo 's wife liu xia is under constant surveillance " many in his position would have given up .
but xiaobo has the mental strength .
if he believes in a goal , he 'll try to reach that goal by all means , even if he knows that he will never be able to reach it , " liu xia , his wife , had said in an interview .
" he can be really stubborn . "
she had had an uneasy feeling and sensed that the communist party would let her husband pay dearly for the charter ' 08 .
sentenced for ' subversion ' in december 2009 , a chinese court sentenced liu xiaobo to eleven years in jail on subversion charges .
in 2007 , he had already anticipated what could happen to him .
" i ’ ve once said that it is a dissident ’ s professional hazard to lose his freedom and being under surveillance .
it is part of a dissident ’ s job , " he told deutsche welle .
" it is your own choice .
you can do other things , be a salesman or a teacher , and earn easy money .
but as soon as you decide to be a dissident , you should withstand pressure with optimism , self-confidence and composure . "
committee defies china liu xiaobo is serving his sentence in a detention facility 500 kilometers northeast of beijing .
once a month he is allowed to receive visitors .
the chinese authorities have harshly protested against the pro-democracy activist receiving the nobel peace prize .
the executive secretary of the norwegian nobel committee geir lundestad reported that the chinese government explicitly threatened the committee not to give the prize to liu .
the decision would have a negative impact on chinese-norwegian relations , beijing said .
bildunterschrift : liu has been sentenced to eleven years in prison for ' subversive ' activities liu had also anticipated this kind of a move : " some european politicians fear that a discussion about human rights can have a negative impact on their economic relations with china .
i don ’ t think so .
the political relationship between china and japan is full of tensions .
but china 's trade relations with japan are among the largest with any country .
so you can see that both these two things do not have anything to do with each other . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 08.12.2010 germany rejects criticism in eurozone bonds spat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over eurozone crisis management continue the tit-for-tat over proposals for joint eurozone bonds continued wednesday , with eurogroup head jean-claude juncker and german chancellor angela merkel trading terse remarks over economic crisis management in the eu . a war of words erupted wednesday between germany and eurogroup leader jean-claude juncker over eurozone crisis discussions .
the row has been brewing since monday , when germany flatly rejected on legal and economic grounds a proposal by juncker for joint eurozone bonds .
in an article to be published thursday in german weekly die zeit , juncker labeled the german reaction as " un-european , " and attacked the government of chancellor angela merkel for not taking a proper look at his proposal - aimed at helping weaker eurozone countries like greece , ireland and portugal raise money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says germany is being un-european " they are rejecting an idea before studying it ...
this way of creating taboo areas in europe and not dealing with others ' ideas is a very un-european way of dealing with european matters , " said juncker , who is also luxembourg 's prime minister .
" germany is thinking a bit simple on that , " he added .
the joint bonds - or e-bonds - could help eurozone members seen as having unstable public finances lower their borrowing costs .
as it stands , the interest that weaker eurozone states must pay out on government bonds stands at more than double - and sometimes triple - the interest paid by stronger members , such as germany .
it is believed such high interest rates for irish and greek bonds contributed to both countries having to seek huge loans from the eu and international monetary fund recently - 110 billion euros and 85 billion euros respectively .
german reaction merkel retorted to juncker 's comments on his e-bond proposal by saying his words were causing unease on world markets .
the yield on a 10-year german government bond recently shot up to 3 percent from 2.4 percent in early november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says juncker 's comments are causing market instability " it does n't help anyone in europe if european figures call each other un-european , " commented merkel 's spokesman steffen seibert in a regular government briefing .
" it is exactly this talking against other people and about other people which should stop , because the markets definitely see this finger-pointing as a sign of discord . "
" the german government remains opposed to the proposal .
the legal and economic concerns about the euro bonds will remain in place for the weeks ahead , " he added .
merkel herself called for " calm " ahead of an eu leaders ' summit next friday , where talks will focus on creating a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone and what the chancellor called " narrow " changes to eu treaties .
" i think that we should work in a calm and goal-oriented manner towards what awaits us next friday .
this calm manner is my contribution to making sure we are successful next friday , " merkel told reporters .

we are the manager for example of the climate investment funds that we implement together with the regional development bank . the good thing about them is the leverage that they get .
by putting in relatively modest amounts of grant money , one can change the behavior of private investors in quite a good way .
so for example the biggest cif is the clean technology fund which is a 4 billion dollar fund .
as a result of that , there will be a total of 40 billion dollars of investment in clean technology .
so it 's a sort of ten to one ratio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steer says large-scale solar energy projects will generate revenue for developing countries .
unfortunately there will never be enough public grant money available to solve all the problems so the name of the game will be to make sure we get this degree of leverage where public funds , private funds and carbon market funds come together .
that 's an example of a positive story .
now overall it is true that some countries are finding that there are too many sources of funding and it 's all a bit complicated , so one of the things we did here in cancun was to launch a website together with undp -lsb- united nations development agency -rsb- that basically tries to untangle the spaghetti .
it will cut out a lot of the transaction costs that are normally associated with financing .
the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- which has played a very good role , is in need of overhaul .
delays are quite considerable , transaction costs are quite high , and predictability of the system is not what it needs to be .
and also money tends to go to a small number of middle income countries .
so we have been favoring reform of the cdm that would reduce costs , increase predictability and would extend the markets into low income countries .
dw : to what extent is the world bank best placed to manage climate investment funds ?
andrew steer : we are not seeking to fly our own flag .
we are simply offering to be helpful .
our speciality is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
we need to now get serious about the problem .
that requires an agency that can operate with large financial packages , engage with governments on monetary issues , bring together different types of finance and that has engagement across a range of sectors .
and we are privileged to have expertise and experience in those areas .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have protested against the world bank in cancun dw : you say you can play a helpful role .
if that 's the case , why are people in cancun demonstrating today against the world bank being in charge of climate assistance ?
andrew steer : i 'm not aware of them demonstrating against it .
views understandably differ .
that 's healthy .
we 're not for one moment suggesting that the world bank is uniquely qualified , but we do believe we have a very helpful role to play .
dw : a lot of this funding is actually loans .
tove ryding , a representative from greenpeace , has said that giving developing countries loans to help them deal with the consequences of climate change caused primarily by developed nations is " the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage . "
what do you say to that ?
andrew steer : this is for negotiators to decide .
that 's why we 're here in cancun .
it 's not the world bank that decides to make it loans rather than grants .
the world bank gives grants , but it also gives zero interest loans for some investments in renewable energy and some investments we give loans that have market based rates .
those decisions are made by the providers of funds and those are represented here by the parties .
i would make just one point and that is , the countries we are working in - and we are working in over 130 countries on climate change - are saying to us , ' we want to get on with it .
we want to be part of a green industrial revolution .
we want to make our economy grow rapidly in a climate resilient way and we want to have access to resources . '
it 's very encouraging because we 're seeing a lot of leadership in developing countries as they want to get on with things and if the choice is between a grant or a loan , you or i or anybody else would prefer a grant .
but that depends on whether or not the countries that are providing the funds want to provide them as grants .
if they do n't , then it 's very encouraging that , nonetheless , a lot of developing countries are getting on with it .
they do n't want to just talk about it .
they want to actually do it .
we believe that cancun really needs to deliver .
it 's possible , it could deliver something very important and we 're really hoping that in the next few days we 'll see that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.12.2010 german government proposes tougher laws for tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just filing backtaxes and an apology might not cut the mustard anymore germany 's cabinet has published a draft law designed to get tough on tax evaders and money launderers .
the new law is supposed to make it harder for tax dodgers to admit their crimes themselves , thus avoiding a trial . the german cabinet on wednesday finalized new draft legislation on tax evasion , as it attempts to close some of the loop holes that allow tax dodgers to avoid prosecution once authorities get wind of their misdemeanors .
the draft bill by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble would make it more difficult for offenders to dodge legal proceedings by preemptively admitting their guilt and paying back taxes .
under current german law , people can avoid a trial by issuing a so-called " voluntary disclosure , " detailing the taxes they have skipped and paying them with 6 percent interest - provided they do so before they are officially prosecuted .
tax evaders can still file a voluntary disclosure after being notified that their assets are under investigation , but the deadline would change under the proposed legislation , meaning that once you have been warned , it 's too late to confess .
" these prosecution-avoiding voluntary disclosures will therefore no longer be effective as part of a calculated tax evasion strategy , " the financial policy spokesman for the christian democratic union , leo dautzenberg , said in an interview with the newspaper die welt .
some german tax dodgers have been abusing this legal loop hole by deliberately waiting until they received their pro-forma warning , and then declaring their assets .
full disclosure the new draft law would also make voluntary disclosures valid only if tax dodgers comprehensively admit to all the assets they have failed to declare that have not become legally outdated .
" people submitting voluntary disclosures will only be immune to proseuction if they completely and accurately disclose information on all assets that qualify for any form of tax , " a government statement says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent government purchase of stolen bank data prompted the debate but of course , the tax authorities would first have to find any withheld funds or assets in order to make a case .
germany recently registered a wave of almost 30,000 voluntary admissions after purchasing cds containing stolen data on foreign bank accounts held by german citizens , as people realized the information might incriminate them .
" our experiences with the flood of voluntary disclosures after the debate over the purchase of tax data highlighted the need to change our legal system and limit the ways in which tax evaders can avoid prosecution , " the budgetary and financial spokesman for the christian social union , bartholomaeus kalb , told parliament on wednesday .
too little , too late ?
however , the proposed changes would represent only a slight tightening of germany 's already lax tax evasion laws , and critics have derided the draft law as a " mini-solution " by a center-right coalition government that does n't want to get too tough on the subject .
" the coalition has become nervous because of the public outcry over the case of the swiss bank data cds , " the chairman of the german union of tax workers , dieter ondracek , told deutsche welle .
" that made ordinary citizens aware of the possibility of submitting a voluntary disclosure , and they were unhappy with the law . "
" the politicians do n't really want to address the issue , because they see revenue from these disclosures as money in the bank , without any messy litigation . "
ondracek , however , believes that it would be better to get rid of voluntary disclosures altogether , arguing the german approach to tax evasion implies that it 's not really considered a crime .
" it 's not just important , it 's a matter of urgency , " ondracek said .
" this possibility only exists for one crime - tax evasion .
how can a crime be serious if you can absolve yourself of legal responsibility at the last minute just by owning up ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister schaeuble could do with the extra cash " in reality , tax evasion is comparable with embezzlement or theft , except you 're not stealing from one person , you 're stealing from every german citizen .
remember , this is a problem that costs our government and taxpayers an absolute minimum of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.2 billion -rrb- per year . "
wasted chance to tackle the deficit ?
that 10 billion euro bottom estimate would represent just under one fifth of the money the heavily indebted german government plans to borrow in 2011 .
missing taxes do not become legally out-dated for 10 years , meaning that german tax dodgers currently owe at least 100 billion euros .
" it would make more sense to try to balance the budget by doing everything we can to secure these missing taxes that people are legally obliged to pay the government , " ondracek said .
" instead , we 're taking out more loans and passing on the interest to our grandchildren . "
the opposition social democrats had also advocated abolishing the voluntary disclosure system altogether , in favor of letting the courts decide whether or not tax evaders deserved to avoid jail sentences or other legal punishments .
" the legal procedure involving voluntary disclosures has existed in germany for 90 years now , " kalb of the christian social union countered .
" it has proved its worth and remains a useful mechanism .
abolishing this system , as per the -lsb- social democrats ' -rsb- suggestion , would be unwise . "

berlin 's new music hotel , nhow , combines luxury , design and quality musical facilities .
it hopes to bridge the gap between international and local artists - but the city 's underground scene is n't easily impressed . musicians are used to life on the road and having to find a place to crash between gigs or rehearsals .
so , many might dream of a hotel with state-of-the-art recording studios right upstairs and high-quality guitars brought by room service . europe 's first music hotel , which recently opened in berlin , offers just that - and also includes its own art gallery , event spaces and recording studios run by rene rennefeld , who also manages the legendary hansa studios where artists such as rem , u2 , and david bowie have made albums . luxury to inspire creativity rennefeld hopes nhow will provide musicians with a " creative microcosm , " responding to their need for comfort while offering a range of facilities for rehearsing , recording or songwriting . " if prince wants to sing in a bathtub , we 'll bring him a microphone , " he said .
" ideally , musicians will work here for several days or weeks , so they have to be at ease . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even stars have to sleep rennefeld and nhow 's general manager , alexander duerr , also intend to promote up-and-coming artists in the area .
the blasglassing quintett , a berlin-based ensemble that uses everyday materials such as old bottles and cans as instruments , recently gave a small , opening concert . the hotel is discussing the possibility of hosting universal music 's concert series " open mic , " which presents bands who have submitted their albums for consideration , and may organize an open competition to record an album in the hotel . " the studios will be available for anyone , " said duerr .
" we 're going to move in all directions to cover the entire spectrum from electronic to pop . " not just for the ears nhow occupies what was an empty plot between universal music 's headquarters and the offices of mtv on berlin 's osthafen , a former industrial zone that has been developed since the 1990s under the auspices of the mediaspree investment project . locally-renowned architect sergei tschoban created the building 's imposing , geometric structure .
it is a counterpart to the first nhow , a fashion-oriented design hotel in milan that opened in 2006 . new york-based designer karim rashid , most famous for his morimoto restaurant in philadelphia and the semiramis hotel in athens , provided nhow berlin 's bright , surrealistic interior .
even the front desk receptionists wear headpieces mirroring the amorphously-shaped furniture and light sculptures that embellish the lobby . vivien bauernschmidt , lead singer of the german band " aloha from hell , " whose album became a number-one seller in japan and made the top 20 chart in germany , said she was speechless when she saw nhow for the first time .
the 18-year-old , who lives nearby in kreuzberg , plans to record an album and spend a night at nhow because she finds the atmosphere so uplifting . " the view from the studio put me in a complete creative flow , " bauernschmidt said .
" a hundred ideas came to me . " not only are gibson guitars and marshall amplifiers available upon request , but all the rooms are equipped with ipod connections and entertainment systems .
the nhow suite , which goes for 2,400 euros -lrb- about $ 3,220 -rrb- a night , has a direct digital connection to the studios . the hotel drew its inspiration in part from the palms casino resort in las vegas , which provides an array of instruments for guests to play and recording studios onsite . bildunterschrift : nhow clearly paints a chic image , but also hopes to draw locals and upcoming artists local musicians not easily impressed still , berlin 's underground music scene is not easily enticed by commercial ventures .
daniel rerat , a manager at the small , berlin-based electronic music label bpitch control , explained that many musicians in the kreuzberg district have had their own private studios for years and greatly value their independence from the mainstream music industry . " there are many small labels in berlin that do n't pay attention to companies like universal music , " he said .
" even if you offered them the best equipment , many musicians would not want to associate themselves with a money-making venture because it 's not cool . "
nevertheless , rennefeld hopes the hotel will include and thrive from the surrounding underground scene .
there are also plans to tap into the nearby club scene with dj events " berlin 's subculture is a source of inspiration , " said rennefeld .
" we want to bring its energy into the recording studio , not just sit in an ivory tower and die from beauty . "
he also points out that it costs about half as much to rent a studio in berlin as it does in london . a city of contrasts bauernschmidt believes that the hotel will not only enliven the area but attract more musicians to berlin . " berlin is an artist 's city , " she said .
" but something like this was missing .
since musicians are constantly on the go , a space like this where they can practice and mingle is the perfect combination . " however , the hotel could only become a local musicians ' haven if it manages to attract both the tourist and indie scenes , which do n't easily mix . " the artists in berlin 's underground scene tend to stick to their own circles , " said rerat .
" it 's a different mentality .
that 's also what makes the city unique - that so many different cultures coexist . " author : rebecca schmid editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 08.12.2010 swiss pirate party lends support to wikileaks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denis simonet is the head of the swiss pirate party the president of the swiss pirate party outlines his group 's relationship with wikileaks .
he told deutsche welle that wikileaks unilaterally announced wikileaks.ch as the official domain name last week . wikileaks announced on friday on twitter that its new official domain name was wikileaks.ch , which is owned by the pirate party of switzerland .
like its counterparts around europe , the party stands for reform of copyright law , abolishing the patent system , the right to privacy , and other digital issues . wikileaks.ch forwards to wikileaks ' site , which is currently being hosted in france .
other european domain names , including wikileaks.de for germany , and wikileaks.fi for finland , also point to the new host .
to learn more about the relationship between the swiss pirate party and wikileaks , deutsche welle spoke with denis simonet , the party 's president . deutsche welle : when did you acquire the wikileaks.ch domain name and why did you decide to acquire it ? denis simonet : that was six months ago based on a request from the pirate party of switzerland .
wikileaks is one sign of a problem that has to be solved .
we are for free speech , free media .
the media has to safeguard the media and if they ca n't do it or do n't do it , then our democracy is in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switch , the swiss registrar , told simonet that there is no reason to block wikileaks.ch did you buy the domain as a measure of support for wikileaks , or did wikileaks ask you to do it ? we did so for ourselves .
we do n't host content anyway .
it 's just a re-direction to the servers .
there are many other servers that do the same .
you can just register a domain and forward it .
it 's no big issue .
we did n't ask to do it .
we just did it because a member thought that it was something the pirate party should do to show support . how did you come into contact with wikileaks and with julian assange ? that was a totally different story .
about three or four weeks ago , he announced in the press that he was seeking a request for political asylum in switzerland .
our board decided that because the reason that he has to request asylum is that he is the media spokesperson for wikileaks and that he is in danger now because he is the media spokesperson .
we thought that switzerland could position itself internationally as a place where freedom of media , freedom of opinion and information is of highly considered status .
that 's why i tried to get in contact with julian assange , so we could help him . the help was to inform him about how switzerland works , about how we have a direct democracy , our federal system of cantons .
i explained the political and administrate landscape in switzerland .
that was a big part of the discussion .
he just listened .
he did n't ask for help , he did n't say anything about whether it helps or if he will stay in switzerland or what his future plans are .
he just said " thank you , " and that 's it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange met with simonet in geneva in november what was he like ?
was he at ease ?
did he seem nervous ? he explained to us what the wikileaks philosophy is .
what he 's said in public is what he is .
he was exactly what i expected .
he has a cause and he wants this cause to be known by the world . did you mention that you had the wikileaks.ch domain name ? no , not at all .
wikileaks.ch was n't part of our discussion .
there was no agreement between us .
wikileaks decided unilaterally to communicate wikileaks.ch as the working , official domain name .
the redirection worked for six months and we did n't change anything .
we did n't get a notice .
we just saw the tweet and then the media began to run to us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks continues to be a thorn in the side of many governments around the world have you had any contact with any law enforcement from switzerland , or anywhere else in europe , or the united states ? no .
no one .
and we have n't had any contact with wikileaks , by the way .
we do n't have contact with them anymore , since that meeting . members of the american government have said that they want wikileaks to return the data it has released and to stop its operation .
are you surprised by the government reaction from the technical side ? no .
it 's well-known that sometimes governments do n't really know what they 're talking about when it comes to technical stuff .
that 's why we exist .
no one understands what digital politics means .
we are fighting to improve that situation - we are working to have digital politics for switzerland .
i think that it wo n't help if people know that we have wikileaks.ch , but it will help if we can start discussions about digital politics . interview : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's matthias von hein thinks the difficulties facing wikileaks and assange reflect poorly on the us . just as wikileaks publishes information that was meant to be secret or classified , so a seemingly private problem for the whistle-blowing website 's founder , julian assange , has become a global political affair .
no one knows what really happened on those two august evenings in sweden , but it 's difficult to see the subsequent and diligent attempts to catch assange by swedish prosecutors as anything other than a part of the dogged us pursuit of wikileaks .
it 's painful for a superpower to have to look on , powerless , as a small group publishes its secrets for the whole world to see .
first , there were the revelations on the afghan war , then the military log books from iraq , and most recently the slew of diplomatic dispatches .
but this powerlessness has transformed into anger , and it 's the display of anger - not the wikileaks files – that might cause the us to really lose face .
what did we really discover from the documents concerning the afghan war ?
little more than a confirmation of that which so many critics had already said - the situation in the country is rather dire .
was there really anything written in the iraq war diaries that forced us to fundamentally alter our perception of the conflict ?
of course it 's more than a little irksome when us diplomats have to dedicate weeks of work primarily to damage limitation and issuing apologies , but has there really been any genuine , lasting damage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein is a senior reporter for deutsche welle and an expert on china .
the us image abroad is more likely to be damaged when hillary clinton blows " cablegate " out of proportion , calling it " an attack on the international community , " or when assange is dubbed a traitor , terrorist , or hardened criminal .
the us really loses face when the online payment service paypal blocks wikileaks ' account , when mastercard stops transferring donations to the whistle-blowing organization , and when the internet service provider amazon suddenly stops hosting the website online .
bear in mind that freedom of expression was the first amendment ever made to the us constitution ; at least in theory , the us places far greater emphasis on this right than many other democratic countries , including germany .
already , participants on internet forums in china are asking just how committed the us really is to freedom of expression , considering its handling of the wikileaks case .
it 's crucial to draw a distinct line between an employee stealing data and documents from a ministry or a business on the one hand , and an independent individual publishing such material to the wider world on the other .
of course , the sheer volume of information released has transformed the modern-day concept of a " leak , " but this increase in scale is also a logical consequence of technological progress .
if it 's true that a total of 800,000 people working for the us government have clearance to access the type of classified files published by wikileaks , then the appearance of such documents in the public sphere can hardly come as a surprise .
in ancient greece , the bearer of bad or sensitive tidings was sometimes executed - but we 're in the 21st century , and the world should have moved on .
as the world 's superpower , the us is forever under pressure to show its quality - this crusade against julian assange is doing precisely the opposite .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 08.12.2010 germany rejects criticism in eurozone bonds spat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over eurozone crisis management continue the tit-for-tat over proposals for joint eurozone bonds continued wednesday , with eurogroup head jean-claude juncker and german chancellor angela merkel trading terse remarks over economic crisis management in the eu . a war of words erupted wednesday between germany and eurogroup leader jean-claude juncker over eurozone crisis discussions .
the row has been brewing since monday , when germany flatly rejected on legal and economic grounds a proposal by juncker for joint eurozone bonds .
in an article to be published thursday in german weekly die zeit , juncker labeled the german reaction as " un-european , " and attacked the government of chancellor angela merkel for not taking a proper look at his proposal - aimed at helping weaker eurozone countries like greece , ireland and portugal raise money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says germany is being un-european " they are rejecting an idea before studying it ...
this way of creating taboo areas in europe and not dealing with others ' ideas is a very un-european way of dealing with european matters , " said juncker , who is also luxembourg 's prime minister .
" germany is thinking a bit simple on that , " he added .
the joint bonds - or e-bonds - could help eurozone members seen as having unstable public finances lower their borrowing costs .
as it stands , the interest that weaker eurozone states must pay out on government bonds stands at more than double - and sometimes triple - the interest paid by stronger members , such as germany .
it is believed such high interest rates for irish and greek bonds contributed to both countries having to seek huge loans from the eu and international monetary fund recently - 110 billion euros and 85 billion euros respectively .
german reaction merkel retorted to juncker 's comments on his e-bond proposal by saying his words were causing unease on world markets .
the yield on a 10-year german government bond recently shot up to 3 percent from 2.4 percent in early november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says juncker 's comments are causing market instability " it does n't help anyone in europe if european figures call each other un-european , " commented merkel 's spokesman steffen seibert in a regular government briefing .
" it is exactly this talking against other people and about other people which should stop , because the markets definitely see this finger-pointing as a sign of discord . "
" the german government remains opposed to the proposal .
the legal and economic concerns about the euro bonds will remain in place for the weeks ahead , " he added .
merkel herself called for " calm " ahead of an eu leaders ' summit next friday , where talks will focus on creating a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone and what the chancellor called " narrow " changes to eu treaties .
" i think that we should work in a calm and goal-oriented manner towards what awaits us next friday .
this calm manner is my contribution to making sure we are successful next friday , " merkel told reporters .

they hope to go back to their country armed with the skills to take up leading positions in ministries or in non-governmental organizations . since 2008 , a number of young afghans have been coming to study at the willy brandt school of public policy at the university of erfurt in central germany .
they learn how to govern countries effectively .
the students have an ambitious goal : to build a peaceful , democratic state in afghanistan , and to rid the country of terror and violence .
in the future , these students hope to form the afghan elite , to find jobs in government ministries or ngos .
after a six-month preparatory program entitled " good governance in afghanistan , " the students are ready to begin a masters course in public policy .
high hopes and clear ambitions moheb jarbakhail is one of 27 young afghans at the willy brandt school .
the 25-year-old says he wants to return to kabul at the end of his course , armed with skills he has learned .
" people like myself can make a significant difference to afghanistan for two reasons , " moheb told deutsche welle .
" one , we get all the academic knowledge of how to govern a society , and the second is : we are from that country , we understand the internal politics .
so , i see my future in helping the afghan public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez wants to help afghan women moheb has been studying in erfurt for almost a year .
before that , he completed a degree in economics at the university of kabul , studied in the us and also worked for an aid organization in afghanistan .
one of only five women on the course is 23 year-old hajar mobarez .
she already knows what women can achieve in afghanistan .
her mother is a member of parliament in kabul .
over the summer holidays , hajar helped her with the election campaign .
the women drove round remote villages , distributing campaign leaflets .
" i want to work for the government , especially in the area of economic development , " hajar said .
" i also want to work for empowering women through providing more educational opportunities . "
can western democracy work in afghanistan ?
a lecturer on the course , kristina roepstorff , has had endless debates with her students , about whether western-style democracy can function in countries like afghanistan .
" some of them strongly rejected the idea of democracy at first , " roepstoff said .
" over time they 've learnt that there are various types of democracy .
they can see it 's a system that makes sense , and that could settle ethnic conflicts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frangis spanta is looking for the best applicants the course is partly financed by the german foreign ministry , and the students also get a grant from the german academic exchange sercive -lrb- daad -rrb- .
frangis spanta , the daughter of a former afghan foreign minister coordinates the masters program .
she 's received 120 applications for next year 's course , although there are just 10 places .
applicants need to bring with them excellent marks , a strong knowledge of english , and political experience .
however not every afghan politician is behind the idea of the germans forging their elite .
" on a political level of course some of the ministries are skeptical , " spanta said .
" they say : ' ok , they 're being trained over there .
but can they really use what they 've learned in germany ? '
the thing is though , afghanistan needs these capabilities . "
hope of the nation in some senses , the young afghans are carrying the weight of their home country on their shoulders .
moheb jarbakhail feels the pressure , but is ambitious and hopeful about the future : " i would like to succeed , " he said .
" i would like to use this opportunity that is given to me to be a knowledgeable person and that pressure is from within and that is one of the motivations that has brought me here to germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hajar mobarez with her german guest parents the students learn all about german culture from their guest parents and at the same time , are motivated by the idea of creating a more positive image of their country .
" i wish that whenever everyone asks me : ‘ where do you come from ? '
i proudly say : ‘ i am from afghanistan , " ' said hajar mobarez .
