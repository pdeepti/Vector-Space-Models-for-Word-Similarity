he said the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's stance on contraception . pope benedict xvi has said in a new book that using condoms may sometimes be justified to stop the spread of aids .
the comments appear to soften the vatican 's strong opposition to condoms on the grounds they are a form of artificial contraception .
benedict said that for male prostitutes - for whom contraception is not a major issue - condoms are " not a moral solution . "
but he said they could be justified " in the intention of reducing the risk of infection . "
the pope made the comments during 20 hours of interviews with german journalist peter seewald .
the remarks will be published in seewald 's new book : " light of the world : the pope , the church and the signs of the times . "
the vatican newspaper published some excerpts of the book ahead of its release on tuesday .
the pope was asked by seewald whether the catholic church is fundamentally against the use of condoms .
" it of course does not see it as a real and moral solution , " the pope responded .
" in certain cases , where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection , it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another , more humane sexuality , " against church teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope caused an outcry in 2009 over comments about fighting aids in africa until now , the vatican has prohibited the use of any form of contraception , even as a barrier against sexually transmitted diseases .
the hard-line stance has drawn international criticism .
last year , when benedict visited aids-ravaged africa , he told reporters the disease was a tragedy that " can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems . "
in the new book , the pope says that in certain cases using a condom may be the first step towards taking responsibility , using the example of male prostitutes . he reiterated that it was " not the proper way to deal with the horror of hiv infection . "
benedict made it clear that the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's fundamental opposition to artificial birth control , a source of grievance to many practicing catholics .
while some roman catholic leaders have spoken about the limited use of condoms to stop the spread of aids as the lesser of two evils , this is the first time the pope has mentioned such an idea in public .
the new book by catholic journalist seewald , set to be translated into 18 languages , arose after a series of interviews with the pontiff conducted in german in july 2010 .
the book addresses a number of other sensitive issues , including the scandals over abusive priests in the catholic church , the debate about celibacy in the church and female ordination .

they have since been accused of espionage which carries much stronger penalties .
accusations are ' absurd ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper launched its appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television in an editorial , bild am sonntag 's editor-in-chief walter mayer wrote that the allegations that the two are spies and not journalists is " absurd . "
" the iranian authorities know perfectly well that they are journalists and nothing else , " wrote mayer .
the newspaper said it had decided to launch a public appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television earlier this week , apparently admitting to their wrongdoings .
" we see that they are doing badly , that they are suffering , " mayer wrote , appealing , " both must come home soon ! "
on friday , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called on iran to respect international law in its treatment of the journalists , including regular consular access and " appropriate custodial conditions . "

they were barred from attending mass inside the building due to repair works .
meanwhile about 100 anti-franco demonstrators gathered outside the valley of the fallen near madrid , a vast underground mausoleum , built on franco 's orders between 1940 and 1958 . historians estimate the site contains the remains of between 40,000 and 60,000 victims of spain 's 1936-1939 civil war .

he said the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's stance on contraception . pope benedict xvi has said in a new book that using condoms may sometimes be justified to stop the spread of aids .
the comments appear to soften the vatican 's strong opposition to condoms on the grounds they are a form of artificial contraception .
benedict said that for male prostitutes - for whom contraception is not a major issue - condoms are " not a moral solution . "
but he said they could be justified " in the intention of reducing the risk of infection . "
the pope made the comments during 20 hours of interviews with german journalist peter seewald .
the remarks will be published in seewald 's new book : " light of the world : the pope , the church and the signs of the times . "
the vatican newspaper published some excerpts of the book ahead of its release on tuesday .
the pope was asked by seewald whether the catholic church is fundamentally against the use of condoms .
" it of course does not see it as a real and moral solution , " the pope responded .
" in certain cases , where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection , it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another , more humane sexuality , " against church teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope caused an outcry in 2009 over comments about fighting aids in africa until now , the vatican has prohibited the use of any form of contraception , even as a barrier against sexually transmitted diseases .
the hard-line stance has drawn international criticism .
last year , when benedict visited aids-ravaged africa , he told reporters the disease was a tragedy that " can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems . "
in the new book , the pope says that in certain cases using a condom may be the first step towards taking responsibility , using the example of male prostitutes . he reiterated that it was " not the proper way to deal with the horror of hiv infection . "
benedict made it clear that the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's fundamental opposition to artificial birth control , a source of grievance to many practicing catholics .
while some roman catholic leaders have spoken about the limited use of condoms to stop the spread of aids as the lesser of two evils , this is the first time the pope has mentioned such an idea in public .
the new book by catholic journalist seewald , set to be translated into 18 languages , arose after a series of interviews with the pontiff conducted in german in july 2010 .
the book addresses a number of other sensitive issues , including the scandals over abusive priests in the catholic church , the debate about celibacy in the church and female ordination .

the elections are regarded as a political barometer ahead of parliamentary elections in 2011 . local elections in poland have opened across the country , in a key test for the government ahead of parliamentary elections next year .
around 48,000 mayors , city council members and other officials are being elected in what is seen as a key test for the governing civic platform party .
led by prime minister donald tusk , the center-right and pro-business civic platform party has governed for three years .
it has been criticized for not trimming back the welfare state as promised .
opinion polls before voting showed the gap had narrowed between civic platform and that of right-wing opposition party law and justice .
the opposition is led by jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of the late polish president lech kaczynski , who died in a plane crash in april .
sunday 's voting is the first round in the election , and in many cases a deciding runoff vote in two weeks will be necessary .

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .
speaking at sunday 's opening ceremony , a former us prosecutor called for the nuremberg spirit to continue to be upheld today . sixty-five years after the opening of the nuremberg trials , the courtroom that witnessed nazi leaders being found guilty of war crimes has been transformed into a museum commemorating the momentous events which saw the eyes of the world fixed on this bavarian city .
benjamin ferencz , a former us prosecutor in the war crimes trials , and one of the few people participants still alive to have taken part in the trials , returned to nuremberg at the age of 90 to speak at the opening of the museum on the anniversary of the world 's first war crimes trial .
speaking at the inauguration of the new museum , ferencz said , " when i left germany for the first time after world war ii and left nuremberg , my biggest regret was that i never heard from any german saying ' i 'm sorry . '
i would never have believed that i would come back 60 years later and would hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country . "
collecting evidence at just 27 , ferencz was the chief prosecutor at the trial of 22 nazis in 1947 , one of the 12 trials that followed the trial of the major war criminals .
after graduating from harvard law school in 1943 he immediately joined the us army , gathering evidence of nazi crimes as the americans liberated the death camps buchenwald , mauthausen and dachau .
speaking in the courtroom in which he led the case for the prosecution in 1947 , ferencz said , " i 've seen the crematoria with the bodies packed outside and the bodies burning inside ...
i have seen the destruction of german cities , of french cities , of british cities ...
i do n't know if we will ever turn the page completely , people will always doubt whether it is possible for human beings to behave in such an inhumane way . "

in contrast , britain , france and the usa demanded that the nazi perpetrators answer for their crimes in a front of a legal court .
it was this insistence which led to the international military tribunal opening its first court session on november 20 , 1945 in courtroom 600 at the palace of justice in nuremberg .
while nazi leaders adolf hitler and heinrich himmler escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of the war , 21 other leading nazis were put on trial in nuremberg .

earlier this month , michael seifert , known as the ‘ butcher of bolzano , ' died at the age of 86 in an italian hospital after being extradited to italy from canada in 2008 .
he was serving a prison sentence for murdering 11 people at a prison camp in bolzano .
seifert was one of the few nazi war criminals still known to be alive .
few witnesses from the time remain , making it increasingly difficult for the courts to continue the work started in nuremberg at the end of the war .

in the late 1940s the court at nuremberg was the target of much criticism .
the trials were held in difficult circumstances , and some historians believe they would have been carried out differently with hindsight .
yet nuremberg is still seen as a model , having established a theory of international law which holds that the perpetrators of such crimes be held to account for their actions .
ferencz bore witness to this at the end of the war , and on sunday used his speech as an opportunity to criticize those countries who , he says , are not giving their full support to the icc , those whom he believes , have lost the spirit of nuremberg .
" the object is not to punish people for crimes against humanity , " he said .
" the object is to prevent those crimes ; by the time you are punishing you have failed . "
quoting judge jackson , ferencz argued that aggression is the supreme international crime , and the law must be applied equally to everyone .

the elections are regarded as a political barometer ahead of parliamentary elections in 2011 . local elections in poland have opened across the country , in a key test for the government ahead of parliamentary elections next year .
around 48,000 mayors , city council members and other officials are being elected in what is seen as a key test for the governing civic platform party .
led by prime minister donald tusk , the center-right and pro-business civic platform party has governed for three years .
it has been criticized for not trimming back the welfare state as promised .
opinion polls before voting showed the gap had narrowed between civic platform and that of right-wing opposition party law and justice .

sunday 's voting is the first round in the election , and in many cases a deciding runoff vote in two weeks will be necessary .

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .
speaking at sunday 's opening ceremony , a former us prosecutor called for the nuremberg spirit to continue to be upheld today . sixty-five years after the opening of the nuremberg trials , the courtroom that witnessed nazi leaders being found guilty of war crimes has been transformed into a museum commemorating the momentous events which saw the eyes of the world fixed on this bavarian city .
benjamin ferencz , a former us prosecutor in the war crimes trials , and one of the few people participants still alive to have taken part in the trials , returned to nuremberg at the age of 90 to speak at the opening of the museum on the anniversary of the world 's first war crimes trial .
speaking at the inauguration of the new museum , ferencz said , " when i left germany for the first time after world war ii and left nuremberg , my biggest regret was that i never heard from any german saying ' i 'm sorry . '
i would never have believed that i would come back 60 years later and would hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country . "
collecting evidence at just 27 , ferencz was the chief prosecutor at the trial of 22 nazis in 1947 , one of the 12 trials that followed the trial of the major war criminals .
after graduating from harvard law school in 1943 he immediately joined the us army , gathering evidence of nazi crimes as the americans liberated the death camps buchenwald , mauthausen and dachau .
speaking in the courtroom in which he led the case for the prosecution in 1947 , ferencz said , " i 've seen the crematoria with the bodies packed outside and the bodies burning inside ...
i have seen the destruction of german cities , of french cities , of british cities ...
i do n't know if we will ever turn the page completely , people will always doubt whether it is possible for human beings to behave in such an inhumane way . "

they have been incarcerated since october 10 . the sunday edition of europe 's best-selling newspaper has made a public appeal for the return of two of its journalists who have been imprisoned in iran .
the two men - a reporter and a photographer for bild am sonntag - were arrested on october 10 while interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani , a woman sentenced to death by stoning for murder and adultery .
bild 's front page read : " we are greatly concerned over two colleagues . "
the reporters were initially accused of not having proper accreditation after entering iran on tourist visas .
they have since been accused of espionage which carries much stronger penalties .
accusations are ' absurd ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper launched its appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television in an editorial , bild am sonntag 's editor-in-chief walter mayer wrote that the allegations that the two are spies and not journalists is " absurd .

" the iranian authorities know perfectly well that they are journalists and nothing else , " wrote mayer .
the newspaper said it had decided to launch a public appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television earlier this week , apparently admitting to their wrongdoings .
" we see that they are doing badly , that they are suffering , " mayer wrote , appealing , " both must come home soon ! "
on friday , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called on iran to respect international law in its treatment of the journalists , including regular consular access and " appropriate custodial conditions . "

and it was n't just german officers on hand .
european police can sometimes cross borders - and they do . police launched a massive operation earlier this month to bring a train transporting nuclear waste safely to its destination , as thousands of demonstrators sought to impede its progress .
the operation cost an estimated 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- , and authorities in germany are looking for ways to pass some of the costs on to the protesters .
however , it was n't just german law enforcement officers protecting the cargo as it headed to the nuclear waste storage facility in the northern german town of gorleben .
officers from france , poland , croatia and the netherlands were also on hand , in various capacities .
pictures of one french policeman apparently suppressing a protester by grabbing him around the neck have caused quite a stir in germany . christoph mueller , a lawyer based in berlin , has filed a complaint against another french policeman in a separate incident that he says he personally witnessed .
" i saw a french policeman , close to the castor transport , who grabbed an activist , talked animatedly to him , and then suppressed him somewhat violently , " mueller told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , it 's a punishable offence .
if a police officer from a foreign country uses force like that , then he has committed a crime under german law , unless he has the proper authorization .
the case will be investigated , and i understand it could carry a punishment of up to two years in prison . "
little-known , but influential treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people tried to block the path of the contentious cargo the french national police 's top authority , the dgpn , has issued a response , defending the actions of its officers who were accompanying the german federal police on their mission to keep the railway lines open .
some confusion was caused , however , by an apparent failure to notify state police in lower saxony - who were responsible for controlling the demonstrations , but not for protecting the railway tracks - about the presence of french officers before the operation began .
" the validity of this intervention can not be called into question , as the french police officer acted under the constant and effective direction of his german colleagues , " the dgpn said in an official statement , also saying that the operation had been organized under the pruem convention -lrb- sometimes called the pruem decision -rrb- , a european cross-border crime fighting arrangement that was signed in the german town of pruem in 2005 .
the french police also referred to article 28 of the treaty , part of which states that " arms , ammunition and equipment … may be used only in legitimate defense of officers themselves or others … the use of arms , ammunition and equipment shall be governed by the host state 's national law . "
austria , spain , germany , belgium , luxembourg , france , finland , slovenia , hungary , the netherlands , estonia and romania are all signatories to the pruem conventio .
italy , portugal , greece , sweden , bulgaria and slovakia are seeking membership .
the convention is not technically a european union agreement , but is only open to member states . it is bound both by eu law and by the laws of the country where the police action occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european borders are still policed , but are more porous now schengen zone opened borders to criminals , but not police under the pruem deal , police can leave their home countries on an emergency impromptu basis - for instance , when pursuing criminals who cross one of the schengen zone 's open borders by car - or for pre-arranged appointments to deal with mass events or disasters , as was the case with the castor protests .
" legally , it 's absolutely ok , " ruediger holecek , a spokesman for the german trade union for police officers , told deutsche welle .
" our organization was one of the first to complain that once europe became border-less , criminals were gifted a massive area to operate in , but police were not . "
holecek said it made perfect sense to have french police operating in germany with these nuclear waste transports , because french environmental activists - aware that the public attitude towards nuclear power is much more positive closer to home , making it harder to drum up support for major demonstrations - often choose to join the ranks of protesters in germany instead .
" one thing that 's utterly clear , though , is that there 's no difference between any police officer - whether they 're from france , germany , the netherlands or anywhere else - serving here : all of them have to operate within the laws of the country they are in .
if an officer from abroad really has overreacted , or used excessive force , then the case will be investigated , just as it would with any german officer , " said holecek .
however , holecek also noted the high number of accusations of police misconduct at the anti-nuclear demonstrations , saying that some of the protesters saw any police intervention as excessive use of force , because of their passionate belief in their cause .
wider-reaching cooperation in some cases , international police cooperation can take place in europe outside the pruem convention , usually through bilateral deals between countries .
for instance , police from croatia - a non-eu member - present at the castor demonstrations were not there as part of the pruem convention , but had been granted permission to observe the operation in plain clothes for training purposes .

" all this is nothing new .

hallmann praises this setup , saying it helps local forces learn about potential troublemakers among the traveling fans , and allows police to be better prepared - in terms of numbers , language skills and background knowledge - to prevent or stop any problems .
as chancellor angela merkel 's government tries to push through a controversial measure to export some german nuclear waste to russia , it 's not clear whether german police would be deployed in russia or european transit countries if protests similar to those in lower saxony last week were to take place - as some german action groups have already threatened .
this could not be arranged under the pruem convention as it stands currently , but in the case of poland , a future bilateral police deal with germany might cover such an operation .
and looking at the example of football hooliganism , it seems police from different countries can find ways to work together , if they see a need to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de policing -pipe- 21.11.2010 anti-nuclear demo highlights europe 's border-free policing policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this french officer 's use of force caused quite an uproar in germany the recent attempt to stop a train carrying nuclear waste to a german storage site prompted a huge police response .
and it was n't just german officers on hand .
european police can sometimes cross borders - and they do . police launched a massive operation earlier this month to bring a train transporting nuclear waste safely to its destination , as thousands of demonstrators sought to impede its progress .
the operation cost an estimated 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- , and authorities in germany are looking for ways to pass some of the costs on to the protesters .
however , it was n't just german law enforcement officers protecting the cargo as it headed to the nuclear waste storage facility in the northern german town of gorleben .
officers from france , poland , croatia and the netherlands were also on hand , in various capacities .
pictures of one french policeman apparently suppressing a protester by grabbing him around the neck have caused quite a stir in germany . christoph mueller , a lawyer based in berlin , has filed a complaint against another french policeman in a separate incident that he says he personally witnessed .
" i saw a french policeman , close to the castor transport , who grabbed an activist , talked animatedly to him , and then suppressed him somewhat violently , " mueller told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , it 's a punishable offence .
if a police officer from a foreign country uses force like that , then he has committed a crime under german law , unless he has the proper authorization .
the case will be investigated , and i understand it could carry a punishment of up to two years in prison . "
little-known , but influential treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people tried to block the path of the contentious cargo the french national police 's top authority , the dgpn , has issued a response , defending the actions of its officers who were accompanying the german federal police on their mission to keep the railway lines open .
some confusion was caused , however , by an apparent failure to notify state police in lower saxony - who were responsible for controlling the demonstrations , but not for protecting the railway tracks - about the presence of french officers before the operation began .
" the validity of this intervention can not be called into question , as the french police officer acted under the constant and effective direction of his german colleagues , " the dgpn said in an official statement , also saying that the operation had been organized under the pruem convention -lrb- sometimes called the pruem decision -rrb- , a european cross-border crime fighting arrangement that was signed in the german town of pruem in 2005 .
the french police also referred to article 28 of the treaty , part of which states that " arms , ammunition and equipment … may be used only in legitimate defense of officers themselves or others … the use of arms , ammunition and equipment shall be governed by the host state 's national law . "
austria , spain , germany , belgium , luxembourg , france , finland , slovenia , hungary , the netherlands , estonia and romania are all signatories to the pruem convention .
italy , portugal , greece , sweden , bulgaria and slovakia are seeking membership .
the convention is not technically a european union agreement , but is only open to member states . it is bound both by eu law and by the laws of the country where the police action occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european borders are still policed , but are more porous now schengen zone opened borders to criminals , but not police under the pruem deal , police can leave their home countries on an emergency impromptu basis - for instance , when pursuing criminals who cross one of the schengen zone 's open borders by car - or for pre-arranged appointments to deal with mass events or disasters , as was the case with the castor protests .
" legally , it 's absolutely ok , " ruediger holecek , a spokesman for the german trade union for police officers , told deutsche welle .
" our organization was one of the first to complain that once europe became border-less , criminals were gifted a massive area to operate in , but police were not . "
holecek said it made perfect sense to have french police operating in germany with these nuclear waste transports , because french environmental activists - aware that the public attitude towards nuclear power is much more positive closer to home , making it harder to drum up support for major demonstrations - often choose to join the ranks of protesters in germany instead .
" one thing that 's utterly clear , though , is that there 's no difference between any police officer - whether they 're from france , germany , the netherlands or anywhere else - serving here : all of them have to operate within the laws of the country they are in .
if an officer from abroad really has overreacted , or used excessive force , then the case will be investigated , just as it would with any german officer , " said holecek .
however , holecek also noted the high number of accusations of police misconduct at the anti-nuclear demonstrations , saying that some of the protesters saw any police intervention as excessive use of force , because of their passionate belief in their cause .
wider-reaching cooperation in some cases , international police cooperation can take place in europe outside the pruem convention , usually through bilateral deals between countries .
for instance , police from croatia - a non-eu member - present at the castor demonstrations were not there as part of the pruem convention , but had been granted permission to observe the operation in plain clothes for training purposes .

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .
speaking at sunday 's opening ceremony , a former us prosecutor called for the nuremberg spirit to continue to be upheld today . sixty-five years after the opening of the nuremberg trials , the courtroom that witnessed nazi leaders being found guilty of war crimes has been transformed into a museum commemorating the momentous events which saw the eyes of the world fixed on this bavarian city .
benjamin ferencz , a former us prosecutor in the war crimes trials , and one of the few people participants still alive to have taken part in the trials , returned to nuremberg at the age of 90 to speak at the opening of the museum on the anniversary of the world 's first war crimes trial .
speaking at the inauguration of the new museum , ferencz said , " when i left germany for the first time after world war ii and left nuremberg , my biggest regret was that i never heard from any german saying ' i 'm sorry . '
i would never have believed that i would come back 60 years later and would hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country . "
collecting evidence at just 27 , ferencz was the chief prosecutor at the trial of 22 nazis in 1947 , one of the 12 trials that followed the trial of the major war criminals .
after graduating from harvard law school in 1943 he immediately joined the us army , gathering evidence of nazi crimes as the americans liberated the death camps buchenwald , mauthausen and dachau .
speaking in the courtroom in which he led the case for the prosecution in 1947 , ferencz said , " i 've seen the crematoria with the bodies packed outside and the bodies burning inside ...
i have seen the destruction of german cities , of french cities , of british cities ...
i do n't know if we will ever turn the page completely , people will always doubt whether it is possible for human beings to behave in such an inhumane way . "
bildunterschrift : allied flags decorate the exterior of the building fair trials during the war , soviet leader joseph stalin called for the mass executions of german soldiers and nazi leaders to be carried out when victory was won .
in contrast , britain , france and the usa demanded that the nazi perpetrators answer for their crimes in a front of a legal court .
it was this insistence which led to the international military tribunal opening its first court session on november 20 , 1945 in courtroom 600 at the palace of justice in nuremberg .
while nazi leaders adolf hitler and heinrich himmler escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of the war , 21 other leading nazis were put on trial in nuremberg .
under the spotlight of the world 's media , the city associated with fanatical nazi rallies was reborn as the city which hosted the first ever war crimes trial .
named the ' trial of the century ' by the media , it lasted 218 days before the accused were led to the dock to hear judgment on october 1 , 1946 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goering committed suicide before his death sentence was carried out although hermann goering escaped his sentence by committing suicide shortly before he was due to be hanged , foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop and the head of the armed forces , wilhelm keitel , were hanged in nuremberg prison in october 1946 along with eight others .
the very dock in which hermann goering and other leading nazis were sentenced to death is now part of the new memorium exhibition housed in an attic area above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
lingering cases the inauguration of the museum , which was attended by the german and russian foreign ministers as well as representatives of the united states , france and great britain , symbolizes the gradual end of nazi war crimes being pursued in the courts , leaving the history books to judge those who may have escaped justice .
earlier this month , michael seifert , known as the ‘ butcher of bolzano , ' died at the age of 86 in an italian hospital after being extradited to italy from canada in 2008 .
he was serving a prison sentence for murdering 11 people at a prison camp in bolzano .
seifert was one of the few nazi war criminals still known to be alive .
few witnesses from the time remain , making it increasingly difficult for the courts to continue the work started in nuremberg at the end of the war .
the ongoing trial of 90-year-old john demjanjuk , accused of murdering 27,000 at the sobidor death camp in poland , may prove the last time a suspected nazi war criminal is seen in the dock .
precursor of the icc the nuremberg trials leave a legacy that extends beyond the nazi period .
at the outset of the trial in 1946 , us chief prosecutor robert h. jackson proclaimed , " the wrongs which we seem to condemn and punish have been ... so devastating , that civilization can not tolerate their being ignored , because it can not survive their being repeated . "
bildunterschrift : two original courtroom benches , and old film images , are part of the exhibit .
despite jackson 's words , courthouse 600 was not the last court to hear allegations of war crimes .
the nuremberg trials paved the way for the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , as well as being the first court to establish the legal precedent of crimes against humanity .
in the late 1940s the court at nuremberg was the target of much criticism .
the trials were held in difficult circumstances , and some historians believe they would have been carried out differently with hindsight .
yet nuremberg is still seen as a model , having established a theory of international law which holds that the perpetrators of such crimes be held to account for their actions .
ferencz bore witness to this at the end of the war , and on sunday used his speech as an opportunity to criticize those countries who , he says , are not giving their full support to the icc , those whom he believes , have lost the spirit of nuremberg .
" the object is not to punish people for crimes against humanity , " he said .
" the object is to prevent those crimes ; by the time you are punishing you have failed . "
quoting judge jackson , ferencz argued that aggression is the supreme international crime , and the law must be applied equally to everyone .
looking down at the podium , the former chief prosecutor then asked the audience , " how far have we come ? " author : naomi scherbel-ball , nuremberg editor : ben knight the museum exhibit is held in the attic above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
the courtroom will however be open to the public when not in use . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it was n't just german officers on hand .
european police can sometimes cross borders - and they do . police launched a massive operation earlier this month to bring a train transporting nuclear waste safely to its destination , as thousands of demonstrators sought to impede its progress .
the operation cost an estimated 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- , and authorities in germany are looking for ways to pass some of the costs on to the protesters .
however , it was n't just german law enforcement officers protecting the cargo as it headed to the nuclear waste storage facility in the northern german town of gorleben .
officers from france , poland , croatia and the netherlands were also on hand , in various capacities .
pictures of one french policeman apparently suppressing a protester by grabbing him around the neck have caused quite a stir in germany . christoph mueller , a lawyer based in berlin , has filed a complaint against another french policeman in a separate incident that he says he personally witnessed .
" i saw a french policeman , close to the castor transport , who grabbed an activist , talked animatedly to him , and then suppressed him somewhat violently , " mueller told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , it 's a punishable offence .
if a police officer from a foreign country uses force like that , then he has committed a crime under german law , unless he has the proper authorization .
the case will be investigated , and i understand it could carry a punishment of up to two years in prison . "
little-known , but influential treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people tried to block the path of the contentious cargo the french national police 's top authority , the dgpn , has issued a response , defending the actions of its officers who were accompanying the german federal police on their mission to keep the railway lines open .
some confusion was caused , however , by an apparent failure to notify state police in lower saxony - who were responsible for controlling the demonstrations , but not for protecting the railway tracks - about the presence of french officers before the operation began .
" the validity of this intervention can not be called into question , as the french police officer acted under the constant and effective direction of his german colleagues , " the dgpn said in an official statement , also saying that the operation had been organized under the pruem convention -lrb- sometimes called the pruem decision -rrb- , a european cross-border crime fighting arrangement that was signed in the german town of pruem in 2005 .
the french police also referred to article 28 of the treaty , part of which states that " arms , ammunition and equipment … may be used only in legitimate defense of officers themselves or others … the use of arms , ammunition and equipment shall be governed by the host state 's national law . "
austria , spain , germany , belgium , luxembourg , france , finland , slovenia , hungary , the netherlands , estonia and romania are all signatories to the pruem convention .
italy , portugal , greece , sweden , bulgaria and slovakia are seeking membership .
the convention is not technically a european union agreement , but is only open to member states . it is bound both by eu law and by the laws of the country where the police action occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european borders are still policed , but are more porous now schengen zone opened borders to criminals , but not police under the pruem deal , police can leave their home countries on an emergency impromptu basis - for instance , when pursuing criminals who cross one of the schengen zone 's open borders by car - or for pre-arranged appointments to deal with mass events or disasters , as was the case with the castor protests .
" legally , it 's absolutely ok , " ruediger holecek , a spokesman for the german trade union for police officers , told deutsche welle .
" our organization was one of the first to complain that once europe became border-less , criminals were gifted a massive area to operate in , but police were not . "
holecek said it made perfect sense to have french police operating in germany with these nuclear waste transports , because french environmental activists - aware that the public attitude towards nuclear power is much more positive closer to home , making it harder to drum up support for major demonstrations - often choose to join the ranks of protesters in germany instead .
" one thing that 's utterly clear , though , is that there 's no difference between any police officer - whether they 're from france , germany , the netherlands or anywhere else - serving here : all of them have to operate within the laws of the country they are in .
if an officer from abroad really has overreacted , or used excessive force , then the case will be investigated , just as it would with any german officer , " said holecek .
however , holecek also noted the high number of accusations of police misconduct at the anti-nuclear demonstrations , saying that some of the protesters saw any police intervention as excessive use of force , because of their passionate belief in their cause .
wider-reaching cooperation in some cases , international police cooperation can take place in europe outside the pruem convention , usually through bilateral deals between countries .
for instance , police from croatia - a non-eu member - present at the castor demonstrations were not there as part of the pruem convention , but had been granted permission to observe the operation in plain clothes for training purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police from 12 eu countries and switzerland lent a hand in germany at the 2006 world cup germany is planning to set up a comprehensive cooperative deal with its eastern neighbor , poland , next year , and so polish police were also on hand to observe the protests .
in turn , many german police officers are scheduled to go to poland and ukraine for the euro 2012 football tournament .
" all this is nothing new .
for example , at the 2006 world cup in germany , polish police were here in hanover helping us keep the peace , " dirk hallmann , a spokesperson for the interior ministry in lower saxony , told deutsche welle .
" in the case of football , we have set up a european network because hooligans have no respect for borders .
they travel with their clubs or national teams for games all over the continent .
for this reason , there 's a clear exchange system between european police forces , coordinated and agreed upon in advance . "
hallmann praises this setup , saying it helps local forces learn about potential troublemakers among the traveling fans , and allows police to be better prepared - in terms of numbers , language skills and background knowledge - to prevent or stop any problems .
as chancellor angela merkel 's government tries to push through a controversial measure to export some german nuclear waste to russia , it 's not clear whether german police would be deployed in russia or european transit countries if protests similar to those in lower saxony last week were to take place - as some german action groups have already threatened .
this could not be arranged under the pruem convention as it stands currently , but in the case of poland , a future bilateral police deal with germany might cover such an operation .
and looking at the example of football hooliganism , it seems police from different countries can find ways to work together , if they see a need to .

for example , at the 2006 world cup in germany , polish police were here in hanover helping us keep the peace , " dirk hallmann , a spokesperson for the interior ministry in lower saxony , told deutsche welle .
" in the case of football , we have set up a european network because hooligans have no respect for borders .
they travel with their clubs or national teams for games all over the continent .
for this reason , there 's a clear exchange system between european police forces , coordinated and agreed upon in advance . "
hallmann praises this setup , saying it helps local forces learn about potential troublemakers among the traveling fans , and allows police to be better prepared - in terms of numbers , language skills and background knowledge - to prevent or stop any problems .
as chancellor angela merkel 's government tries to push through a controversial measure to export some german nuclear waste to russia , it 's not clear whether german police would be deployed in russia or european transit countries if protests similar to those in lower saxony last week were to take place - as some german action groups have already threatened .
this could not be arranged under the pruem convention as it stands currently , but in the case of poland , a future bilateral police deal with germany might cover such an operation .
and looking at the example of football hooliganism , it seems police from different countries can find ways to work together , if they see a need to .

he said the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's stance on contraception . pope benedict xvi has said in a new book that using condoms may sometimes be justified to stop the spread of aids .
the comments appear to soften the vatican 's strong opposition to condoms on the grounds they are a form of artificial contraception .
benedict said that for male prostitutes - for whom contraception is not a major issue - condoms are " not a moral solution . "
but he said they could be justified " in the intention of reducing the risk of infection . "
the pope made the comments during 20 hours of interviews with german journalist peter seewald .
the remarks will be published in seewald 's new book : " light of the world : the pope , the church and the signs of the times . "
the vatican newspaper published some excerpts of the book ahead of its release on tuesday .
the pope was asked by seewald whether the catholic church is fundamentally against the use of condoms .
" it of course does not see it as a real and moral solution , " the pope responded .
" in certain cases , where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection , it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another , more humane sexuality , " against church teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope caused an outcry in 2009 over comments about fighting aids in africa until now , the vatican has prohibited the use of any form of contraception , even as a barrier against sexually transmitted diseases .
the hard-line stance has drawn international criticism .
last year , when benedict visited aids-ravaged africa , he told reporters the disease was a tragedy that " can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems . "
in the new book , the pope says that in certain cases using a condom may be the first step towards taking responsibility , using the example of male prostitutes . he reiterated that it was " not the proper way to deal with the horror of hiv infection . "
benedict made it clear that the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's fundamental opposition to artificial birth control , a source of grievance to many practicing catholics .
while some roman catholic leaders have spoken about the limited use of condoms to stop the spread of aids as the lesser of two evils , this is the first time the pope has mentioned such an idea in public .
the new book by catholic journalist seewald , set to be translated into 18 languages , arose after a series of interviews with the pontiff conducted in german in july 2010 .
the book addresses a number of other sensitive issues , including the scandals over abusive priests in the catholic church , the debate about celibacy in the church and female ordination .

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .
speaking at sunday 's opening ceremony , a former us prosecutor called for the nuremberg spirit to continue to be upheld today . sixty-five years after the opening of the nuremberg trials , the courtroom that witnessed nazi leaders being found guilty of war crimes has been transformed into a museum commemorating the momentous events which saw the eyes of the world fixed on this bavarian city .
benjamin ferencz , a former us prosecutor in the war crimes trials , and one of the few people participants still alive to have taken part in the trials , returned to nuremberg at the age of 90 to speak at the opening of the museum on the anniversary of the world 's first war crimes trial .
speaking at the inauguration of the new museum , ferencz said , " when i left germany for the first time after world war ii and left nuremberg , my biggest regret was that i never heard from any german saying ' i 'm sorry . '
i would never have believed that i would come back 60 years later and would hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country . "
collecting evidence at just 27 , ferencz was the chief prosecutor at the trial of 22 nazis in 1947 , one of the 12 trials that followed the trial of the major war criminals .
after graduating from harvard law school in 1943 he immediately joined the us army , gathering evidence of nazi crimes as the americans liberated the death camps buchenwald , mauthausen and dachau .
speaking in the courtroom in which he led the case for the prosecution in 1947 , ferencz said , " i 've seen the crematoria with the bodies packed outside and the bodies burning inside ...
i have seen the destruction of german cities , of french cities , of british cities ...
i do n't know if we will ever turn the page completely , people will always doubt whether it is possible for human beings to behave in such an inhumane way . "
bildunterschrift : allied flags decorate the exterior of the building fair trials during the war , soviet leader joseph stalin called for the mass executions of german soldiers and nazi leaders to be carried out when victory was won .
in contrast , britain , france and the usa demanded that the nazi perpetrators answer for their crimes in a front of a legal court .
it was this insistence which led to the international military tribunal opening its first court session on november 20 , 1945 in courtroom 600 at the palace of justice in nuremberg .
while nazi leaders adolf hitler and heinrich himmler escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of the war , 21 other leading nazis were put on trial in nuremberg .
under the spotlight of the world 's media , the city associated with fanatical nazi rallies was reborn as the city which hosted the first ever war crimes trial .
named the ' trial of the century ' by the media , it lasted 218 days before the accused were led to the dock to hear judgment on october 1 , 1946 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goering committed suicide before his death sentence was carried out although hermann goering escaped his sentence by committing suicide shortly before he was due to be hanged , foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop and the head of the armed forces , wilhelm keitel , were hanged in nuremberg prison in october 1946 along with eight others .
the very dock in which hermann goering and other leading nazis were sentenced to death is now part of the new memorium exhibition housed in an attic area above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
lingering cases the inauguration of the museum , which was attended by the german and russian foreign ministers as well as representatives of the united states , france and great britain , symbolizes the gradual end of nazi war crimes being pursued in the courts , leaving the history books to judge those who may have escaped justice .
earlier this month , michael seifert , known as the ‘ butcher of bolzano , ' died at the age of 86 in an italian hospital after being extradited to italy from canada in 2008 .
he was serving a prison sentence for murdering 11 people at a prison camp in bolzano .
seifert was one of the few nazi war criminals still known to be alive .
few witnesses from the time remain , making it increasingly difficult for the courts to continue the work started in nuremberg at the end of the war .
the ongoing trial of 90-year-old john demjanjuk , accused of murdering 27,000 at the sobidor death camp in poland , may prove the last time a suspected nazi war criminal is seen in the dock .
precursor of the icc the nuremberg trials leave a legacy that extends beyond the nazi period .
at the outset of the trial in 1946 , us chief prosecutor robert h. jackson proclaimed , " the wrongs which we seem to condemn and punish have been ... so devastating , that civilization can not tolerate their being ignored , because it can not survive their being repeated . "
bildunterschrift : two original courtroom benches , and old film images , are part of the exhibit .
despite jackson 's words , courthouse 600 was not the last court to hear allegations of war crimes .
the nuremberg trials paved the way for the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , as well as being the first court to establish the legal precedent of crimes against humanity .
in the late 1940s the court at nuremberg was the target of much criticism .
the trials were held in difficult circumstances , and some historians believe they would have been carried out differently with hindsight .
yet nuremberg is still seen as a model , having established a theory of international law which holds that the perpetrators of such crimes be held to account for their actions .
ferencz bore witness to this at the end of the war , and on sunday used his speech as an opportunity to criticize those countries who , he says , are not giving their full support to the icc , those whom he believes , have lost the spirit of nuremberg .
" the object is not to punish people for crimes against humanity , " he said .
" the object is to prevent those crimes ; by the time you are punishing you have failed . "
quoting judge jackson , ferencz argued that aggression is the supreme international crime , and the law must be applied equally to everyone .
looking down at the podium , the former chief prosecutor then asked the audience , " how far have we come ? " author : naomi scherbel-ball , nuremberg editor : ben knight the museum exhibit is held in the attic above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .
speaking at sunday 's opening ceremony , a former us prosecutor called for the nuremberg spirit to continue to be upheld today . sixty-five years after the opening of the nuremberg trials , the courtroom that witnessed nazi leaders being found guilty of war crimes has been transformed into a museum commemorating the momentous events which saw the eyes of the world fixed on this bavarian city .
benjamin ferencz , a former us prosecutor in the war crimes trials , and one of the few people participants still alive to have taken part in the trials , returned to nuremberg at the age of 90 to speak at the opening of the museum on the anniversary of the world 's first war crimes trial .
speaking at the inauguration of the new museum , ferencz said , " when i left germany for the first time after world war ii and left nuremberg , my biggest regret was that i never heard from any german saying ' i 'm sorry . '
i would never have believed that i would come back 60 years later and would hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country . "
collecting evidence at just 27 , ferencz was the chief prosecutor at the trial of 22 nazis in 1947 , one of the 12 trials that followed the trial of the major war criminals .
after graduating from harvard law school in 1943 he immediately joined the us army , gathering evidence of nazi crimes as the americans liberated the death camps buchenwald , mauthausen and dachau .
speaking in the courtroom in which he led the case for the prosecution in 1947 , ferencz said , " i 've seen the crematoria with the bodies packed outside and the bodies burning inside ...
i have seen the destruction of german cities , of french cities , of british cities ...
i do n't know if we will ever turn the page completely , people will always doubt whether it is possible for human beings to behave in such an inhumane way . "
bildunterschrift : allied flags decorate the exterior of the building fair trials during the war , soviet leader joseph stalin called for the mass executions of german soldiers and nazi leaders to be carried out when victory was won .
in contrast , britain , france and the usa demanded that the nazi perpetrators answer for their crimes in a front of a legal court .
it was this insistence which led to the international military tribunal opening its first court session on november 20 , 1945 in courtroom 600 at the palace of justice in nuremberg .
while nazi leaders adolf hitler and heinrich himmler escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of the war , 21 other leading nazis were put on trial in nuremberg .
under the spotlight of the world 's media , the city associated with fanatical nazi rallies was reborn as the city which hosted the first ever war crimes trial .
named the ' trial of the century ' by the media , it lasted 218 days before the accused were led to the dock to hear judgment on october 1 , 1946 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goering committed suicide before his death sentence was carried out although hermann goering escaped his sentence by committing suicide shortly before he was due to be hanged , foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop and the head of the armed forces , wilhelm keitel , were hanged in nuremberg prison in october 1946 along with eight others .
the very dock in which hermann goering and other leading nazis were sentenced to death is now part of the new memorium exhibition housed in an attic area above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
lingering cases the inauguration of the museum , which was attended by the german and russian foreign ministers as well as representatives of the united states , france and great britain , symbolizes the gradual end of nazi war crimes being pursued in the courts , leaving the history books to judge those who may have escaped justice .
earlier this month , michael seifert , known as the ‘ butcher of bolzano , ' died at the age of 86 in an italian hospital after being extradited to italy from canada in 2008 .
he was serving a prison sentence for murdering 11 people at a prison camp in bolzano .
seifert was one of the few nazi war criminals still known to be alive .
few witnesses from the time remain , making it increasingly difficult for the courts to continue the work started in nuremberg at the end of the war .
the ongoing trial of 90-year-old john demjanjuk , accused of murdering 27,000 at the sobidor death camp in poland , may prove the last time a suspected nazi war criminal is seen in the dock .
precursor of the icc the nuremberg trials leave a legacy that extends beyond the nazi period .
at the outset of the trial in 1946 , us chief prosecutor robert h. jackson proclaimed , " the wrongs which we seem to condemn and punish have been ... so devastating , that civilization can not tolerate their being ignored , because it can not survive their being repeated . "
bildunterschrift : two original courtroom benches , and old film images , are part of the exhibit .
despite jackson 's words , courthouse 600 was not the last court to hear allegations of war crimes .
the nuremberg trials paved the way for the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , as well as being the first court to establish the legal precedent of crimes against humanity .
in the late 1940s the court at nuremberg was the target of much criticism .
the trials were held in difficult circumstances , and some historians believe they would have been carried out differently with hindsight .
yet nuremberg is still seen as a model , having established a theory of international law which holds that the perpetrators of such crimes be held to account for their actions .
ferencz bore witness to this at the end of the war , and on sunday used his speech as an opportunity to criticize those countries who , he says , are not giving their full support to the icc , those whom he believes , have lost the spirit of nuremberg .
" the object is not to punish people for crimes against humanity , " he said .
" the object is to prevent those crimes ; by the time you are punishing you have failed . "
quoting judge jackson , ferencz argued that aggression is the supreme international crime , and the law must be applied equally to everyone .
looking down at the podium , the former chief prosecutor then asked the audience , " how far have we come ? " author : naomi scherbel-ball , nuremberg editor : ben knight the museum exhibit is held in the attic above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
the courtroom will however be open to the public when not in use . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's stance on contraception . pope benedict xvi has said in a new book that using condoms may sometimes be justified to stop the spread of aids .
the comments appear to soften the vatican 's strong opposition to condoms on the grounds they are a form of artificial contraception .
benedict said that for male prostitutes - for whom contraception is not a major issue - condoms are " not a moral solution . "
but he said they could be justified " in the intention of reducing the risk of infection . "
the pope made the comments during 20 hours of interviews with german journalist peter seewald .
the remarks will be published in seewald 's new book : " light of the world : the pope , the church and the signs of the times . "
the vatican newspaper published some excerpts of the book ahead of its release on tuesday .
the pope was asked by seewald whether the catholic church is fundamentally against the use of condoms .
" it of course does not see it as a real and moral solution , " the pope responded .
" in certain cases , where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection , it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another , more humane sexuality , " against church teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope caused an outcry in 2009 over comments about fighting aids in africa until now , the vatican has prohibited the use of any form of contraception , even as a barrier against sexually transmitted diseases .
the hard-line stance has drawn international criticism .
last year , when benedict visited aids-ravaged africa , he told reporters the disease was a tragedy that " can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems . "
in the new book , the pope says that in certain cases using a condom may be the first step towards taking responsibility , using the example of male prostitutes . he reiterated that it was " not the proper way to deal with the horror of hiv infection . "
benedict made it clear that the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's fundamental opposition to artificial birth control , a source of grievance to many practicing catholics .
while some roman catholic leaders have spoken about the limited use of condoms to stop the spread of aids as the lesser of two evils , this is the first time the pope has mentioned such an idea in public .
the new book by catholic journalist seewald , set to be translated into 18 languages , arose after a series of interviews with the pontiff conducted in german in july 2010 .
the book addresses a number of other sensitive issues , including the scandals over abusive priests in the catholic church , the debate about celibacy in the church and female ordination .

he said the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's stance on contraception . pope benedict xvi has said in a new book that using condoms may sometimes be justified to stop the spread of aids .
the comments appear to soften the vatican 's strong opposition to condoms on the grounds they are a form of artificial contraception .
benedict said that for male prostitutes - for whom contraception is not a major issue - condoms are " not a moral solution . "
but he said they could be justified " in the intention of reducing the risk of infection . "
the pope made the comments during 20 hours of interviews with german journalist peter seewald .
the remarks will be published in seewald 's new book : " light of the world : the pope , the church and the signs of the times . "
the vatican newspaper published some excerpts of the book ahead of its release on tuesday .
the pope was asked by seewald whether the catholic church is fundamentally against the use of condoms .
" it of course does not see it as a real and moral solution , " the pope responded .
" in certain cases , where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection , it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another , more humane sexuality , " against church teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope caused an outcry in 2009 over comments about fighting aids in africa until now , the vatican has prohibited the use of any form of contraception , even as a barrier against sexually transmitted diseases .
the hard-line stance has drawn international criticism .
last year , when benedict visited aids-ravaged africa , he told reporters the disease was a tragedy that " can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems . "
in the new book , the pope says that in certain cases using a condom may be the first step towards taking responsibility , using the example of male prostitutes . he reiterated that it was " not the proper way to deal with the horror of hiv infection . "
benedict made it clear that the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's fundamental opposition to artificial birth control , a source of grievance to many practicing catholics .
while some roman catholic leaders have spoken about the limited use of condoms to stop the spread of aids as the lesser of two evils , this is the first time the pope has mentioned such an idea in public .
the new book by catholic journalist seewald , set to be translated into 18 languages , arose after a series of interviews with the pontiff conducted in german in july 2010 .
the book addresses a number of other sensitive issues , including the scandals over abusive priests in the catholic church , the debate about celibacy in the church and female ordination .

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .
speaking at sunday 's opening ceremony , a former us prosecutor called for the nuremberg spirit to continue to be upheld today . sixty-five years after the opening of the nuremberg trials , the courtroom that witnessed nazi leaders being found guilty of war crimes has been transformed into a museum commemorating the momentous events which saw the eyes of the world fixed on this bavarian city .
benjamin ferencz , a former us prosecutor in the war crimes trials , and one of the few people participants still alive to have taken part in the trials , returned to nuremberg at the age of 90 to speak at the opening of the museum on the anniversary of the world 's first war crimes trial .
speaking at the inauguration of the new museum , ferencz said , " when i left germany for the first time after world war ii and left nuremberg , my biggest regret was that i never heard from any german saying ' i 'm sorry . '
i would never have believed that i would come back 60 years later and would hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country . "
collecting evidence at just 27 , ferencz was the chief prosecutor at the trial of 22 nazis in 1947 , one of the 12 trials that followed the trial of the major war criminals .
after graduating from harvard law school in 1943 he immediately joined the us army , gathering evidence of nazi crimes as the americans liberated the death camps buchenwald , mauthausen and dachau .
speaking in the courtroom in which he led the case for the prosecution in 1947 , ferencz said , " i 've seen the crematoria with the bodies packed outside and the bodies burning inside ...
i have seen the destruction of german cities , of french cities , of british cities ...
i do n't know if we will ever turn the page completely , people will always doubt whether it is possible for human beings to behave in such an inhumane way . "
bildunterschrift : allied flags decorate the exterior of the building fair trials during the war , soviet leader joseph stalin called for the mass executions of german soldiers and nazi leaders to be carried out when victory was won .
in contrast , britain , france and the usa demanded that the nazi perpetrators answer for their crimes in a front of a legal court .
it was this insistence which led to the international military tribunal opening its first court session on november 20 , 1945 in courtroom 600 at the palace of justice in nuremberg .
while nazi leaders adolf hitler and heinrich himmler escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of the war , 21 other leading nazis were put on trial in nuremberg .
under the spotlight of the world 's media , the city associated with fanatical nazi rallies was reborn as the city which hosted the first ever war crimes trial .
named the ' trial of the century ' by the media , it lasted 218 days before the accused were led to the dock to hear judgment on october 1 , 1946 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goering committed suicide before his death sentence was carried out although hermann goering escaped his sentence by committing suicide shortly before he was due to be hanged , foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop and the head of the armed forces , wilhelm keitel , were hanged in nuremberg prison in october 1946 along with eight others .
the very dock in which hermann goering and other leading nazis were sentenced to death is now part of the new memorium exhibition housed in an attic area above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
lingering cases the inauguration of the museum , which was attended by the german and russian foreign ministers as well as representatives of the united states , france and great britain , symbolizes the gradual end of nazi war crimes being pursued in the courts , leaving the history books to judge those who may have escaped justice .
earlier this month , michael seifert , known as the ‘ butcher of bolzano , ' died at the age of 86 in an italian hospital after being extradited to italy from canada in 2008 .
he was serving a prison sentence for murdering 11 people at a prison camp in bolzano .
seifert was one of the few nazi war criminals still known to be alive .
few witnesses from the time remain , making it increasingly difficult for the courts to continue the work started in nuremberg at the end of the war .
the ongoing trial of 90-year-old john demjanjuk , accused of murdering 27,000 at the sobidor death camp in poland , may prove the last time a suspected nazi war criminal is seen in the dock .
precursor of the icc the nuremberg trials leave a legacy that extends beyond the nazi period .
at the outset of the trial in 1946 , us chief prosecutor robert h. jackson proclaimed , " the wrongs which we seem to condemn and punish have been ... so devastating , that civilization can not tolerate their being ignored , because it can not survive their being repeated . "
bildunterschrift : two original courtroom benches , and old film images , are part of the exhibit .
despite jackson 's words , courthouse 600 was not the last court to hear allegations of war crimes .
the nuremberg trials paved the way for the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , as well as being the first court to establish the legal precedent of crimes against humanity .
in the late 1940s the court at nuremberg was the target of much criticism .
the trials were held in difficult circumstances , and some historians believe they would have been carried out differently with hindsight .
yet nuremberg is still seen as a model , having established a theory of international law which holds that the perpetrators of such crimes be held to account for their actions .
ferencz bore witness to this at the end of the war , and on sunday used his speech as an opportunity to criticize those countries who , he says , are not giving their full support to the icc , those whom he believes , have lost the spirit of nuremberg .
" the object is not to punish people for crimes against humanity , " he said .
" the object is to prevent those crimes ; by the time you are punishing you have failed . "
quoting judge jackson , ferencz argued that aggression is the supreme international crime , and the law must be applied equally to everyone .
looking down at the podium , the former chief prosecutor then asked the audience , " how far have we come ? " author : naomi scherbel-ball , nuremberg editor : ben knight the museum exhibit is held in the attic above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
the courtroom will however be open to the public when not in use . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two men - a reporter and a photographer for bild am sonntag - were arrested on october 10 while interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani , a woman sentenced to death by stoning for murder and adultery .
bild 's front page read : " we are greatly concerned over two colleagues . "
the reporters were initially accused of not having proper accreditation after entering iran on tourist visas .
they have since been accused of espionage which carries much stronger penalties .
accusations are ' absurd ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper launched its appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television in an editorial , bild am sonntag 's editor-in-chief walter mayer wrote that the allegations that the two are spies and not journalists is " absurd .

the newspaper said it had decided to launch a public appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television earlier this week , apparently admitting to their wrongdoings .
" we see that they are doing badly , that they are suffering , " mayer wrote , appealing , " both must come home soon ! "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de policing -pipe- 21.11.2010 anti-nuclear demo highlights europe 's border-free policing policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this french officer 's use of force caused quite an uproar in germany the recent attempt to stop a train carrying nuclear waste to a german storage site prompted a huge police response .
and it was n't just german officers on hand .
european police can sometimes cross borders - and they do . police launched a massive operation earlier this month to bring a train transporting nuclear waste safely to its destination , as thousands of demonstrators sought to impede its progress .
the operation cost an estimated 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- , and authorities in germany are looking for ways to pass some of the costs on to the protesters .
however , it was n't just german law enforcement officers protecting the cargo as it headed to the nuclear waste storage facility in the northern german town of gorleben .
officers from france , poland , croatia and the netherlands were also on hand , in various capacities .
pictures of one french policeman apparently suppressing a protester by grabbing him around the neck have caused quite a stir in germany . christoph mueller , a lawyer based in berlin , has filed a complaint against another french policeman in a separate incident that he says he personally witnessed .
" i saw a french policeman , close to the castor transport , who grabbed an activist , talked animatedly to him , and then suppressed him somewhat violently , " mueller told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , it 's a punishable offence .
if a police officer from a foreign country uses force like that , then he has committed a crime under german law , unless he has the proper authorization .
the case will be investigated , and i understand it could carry a punishment of up to two years in prison . "
little-known , but influential treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people tried to block the path of the contentious cargo the french national police 's top authority , the dgpn , has issued a response , defending the actions of its officers who were accompanying the german federal police on their mission to keep the railway lines open .
some confusion was caused , however , by an apparent failure to notify state police in lower saxony - who were responsible for controlling the demonstrations , but not for protecting the railway tracks - about the presence of french officers before the operation began .
" the validity of this intervention can not be called into question , as the french police officer acted under the constant and effective direction of his german colleagues , " the dgpn said in an official statement , also saying that the operation had been organized under the pruem convention -lrb- sometimes called the pruem decision -rrb- , a european cross-border crime fighting arrangement that was signed in the german town of pruem in 2005 .
the french police also referred to article 28 of the treaty , part of which states that " arms , ammunition and equipment … may be used only in legitimate defense of officers themselves or others … the use of arms , ammunition and equipment shall be governed by the host state 's national law . "
austria , spain , germany , belgium , luxembourg , france , finland , slovenia , hungary , the netherlands , estonia and romania are all signatories to the pruem convention .
italy , portugal , greece , sweden , bulgaria and slovakia are seeking membership .
the convention is not technically a european union agreement , but is only open to member states . it is bound both by eu law and by the laws of the country where the police action occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european borders are still policed , but are more porous now schengen zone opened borders to criminals , but not police under the pruem deal , police can leave their home countries on an emergency impromptu basis - for instance , when pursuing criminals who cross one of the schengen zone 's open borders by car - or for pre-arranged appointments to deal with mass events or disasters , as was the case with the castor protests .
" legally , it 's absolutely ok , " ruediger holecek , a spokesman for the german trade union for police officers , told deutsche welle .
" our organization was one of the first to complain that once europe became border-less , criminals were gifted a massive area to operate in , but police were not . "
holecek said it made perfect sense to have french police operating in germany with these nuclear waste transports , because french environmental activists - aware that the public attitude towards nuclear power is much more positive closer to home , making it harder to drum up support for major demonstrations - often choose to join the ranks of protesters in germany instead .
" one thing that 's utterly clear , though , is that there 's no difference between any police officer - whether they 're from france , germany , the netherlands or anywhere else - serving here : all of them have to operate within the laws of the country they are in .
if an officer from abroad really has overreacted , or used excessive force , then the case will be investigated , just as it would with any german officer , " said holecek .
however , holecek also noted the high number of accusations of police misconduct at the anti-nuclear demonstrations , saying that some of the protesters saw any police intervention as excessive use of force , because of their passionate belief in their cause .
wider-reaching cooperation in some cases , international police cooperation can take place in europe outside the pruem convention , usually through bilateral deals between countries .
for instance , police from croatia - a non-eu member - present at the castor demonstrations were not there as part of the pruem convention , but had been granted permission to observe the operation in plain clothes for training purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police from 12 eu countries and switzerland lent a hand in germany at the 2006 world cup germany is planning to set up a comprehensive cooperative deal with its eastern neighbor , poland , next year , and so polish police were also on hand to observe the protests .
in turn , many german police officers are scheduled to go to poland and ukraine for the euro 2012 football tournament .
" all this is nothing new .
for example , at the 2006 world cup in germany , polish police were here in hanover helping us keep the peace , " dirk hallmann , a spokesperson for the interior ministry in lower saxony , told deutsche welle .
" in the case of football , we have set up a european network because hooligans have no respect for borders .
they travel with their clubs or national teams for games all over the continent .
for this reason , there 's a clear exchange system between european police forces , coordinated and agreed upon in advance . "
hallmann praises this setup , saying it helps local forces learn about potential troublemakers among the traveling fans , and allows police to be better prepared - in terms of numbers , language skills and background knowledge - to prevent or stop any problems .
as chancellor angela merkel 's government tries to push through a controversial measure to export some german nuclear waste to russia , it 's not clear whether german police would be deployed in russia or european transit countries if protests similar to those in lower saxony last week were to take place - as some german action groups have already threatened .
this could not be arranged under the pruem convention as it stands currently , but in the case of poland , a future bilateral police deal with germany might cover such an operation .
and looking at the example of football hooliganism , it seems police from different countries can find ways to work together , if they see a need to .

and it was n't just german officers on hand .
european police can sometimes cross borders - and they do . police launched a massive operation earlier this month to bring a train transporting nuclear waste safely to its destination , as thousands of demonstrators sought to impede its progress .
the operation cost an estimated 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- , and authorities in germany are looking for ways to pass some of the costs on to the protesters .
however , it was n't just german law enforcement officers protecting the cargo as it headed to the nuclear waste storage facility in the northern german town of gorleben .
officers from france , poland , croatia and the netherlands were also on hand , in various capacities .
pictures of one french policeman apparently suppressing a protester by grabbing him around the neck have caused quite a stir in germany . christoph mueller , a lawyer based in berlin , has filed a complaint against another french policeman in a separate incident that he says he personally witnessed .
" i saw a french policeman , close to the castor transport , who grabbed an activist , talked animatedly to him , and then suppressed him somewhat violently , " mueller told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , it 's a punishable offence .
if a police officer from a foreign country uses force like that , then he has committed a crime under german law , unless he has the proper authorization .
the case will be investigated , and i understand it could carry a punishment of up to two years in prison . "
little-known , but influential treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people tried to block the path of the contentious cargo the french national police 's top authority , the dgpn , has issued a response , defending the actions of its officers who were accompanying the german federal police on their mission to keep the railway lines open .
some confusion was caused , however , by an apparent failure to notify state police in lower saxony - who were responsible for controlling the demonstrations , but not for protecting the railway tracks - about the presence of french officers before the operation began .
" the validity of this intervention can not be called into question , as the french police officer acted under the constant and effective direction of his german colleagues , " the dgpn said in an official statement , also saying that the operation had been organized under the pruem convention -lrb- sometimes called the pruem decision -rrb- , a european cross-border crime fighting arrangement that was signed in the german town of pruem in 2005 .
the french police also referred to article 28 of the treaty , part of which states that " arms , ammunition and equipment … may be used only in legitimate defense of officers themselves or others … the use of arms , ammunition and equipment shall be governed by the host state 's national law . "
austria , spain , germany , belgium , luxembourg , france , finland , slovenia , hungary , the netherlands , estonia and romania are all signatories to the pruem convention .
italy , portugal , greece , sweden , bulgaria and slovakia are seeking membership .
the convention is not technically a european union agreement , but is only open to member states . it is bound both by eu law and by the laws of the country where the police action occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european borders are still policed , but are more porous now schengen zone opened borders to criminals , but not police under the pruem deal , police can leave their home countries on an emergency impromptu basis - for instance , when pursuing criminals who cross one of the schengen zone 's open borders by car - or for pre-arranged appointments to deal with mass events or disasters , as was the case with the castor protests .
" legally , it 's absolutely ok , " ruediger holecek , a spokesman for the german trade union for police officers , told deutsche welle .
" our organization was one of the first to complain that once europe became border-less , criminals were gifted a massive area to operate in , but police were not . "
holecek said it made perfect sense to have french police operating in germany with these nuclear waste transports , because french environmental activists - aware that the public attitude towards nuclear power is much more positive closer to home , making it harder to drum up support for major demonstrations - often choose to join the ranks of protesters in germany instead .
" one thing that 's utterly clear , though , is that there 's no difference between any police officer - whether they 're from france , germany , the netherlands or anywhere else - serving here : all of them have to operate within the laws of the country they are in .
if an officer from abroad really has overreacted , or used excessive force , then the case will be investigated , just as it would with any german officer , " said holecek .
however , holecek also noted the high number of accusations of police misconduct at the anti-nuclear demonstrations , saying that some of the protesters saw any police intervention as excessive use of force , because of their passionate belief in their cause .
wider-reaching cooperation in some cases , international police cooperation can take place in europe outside the pruem convention , usually through bilateral deals between countries .
for instance , police from croatia - a non-eu member - present at the castor demonstrations were not there as part of the pruem convention , but had been granted permission to observe the operation in plain clothes for training purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police from 12 eu countries and switzerland lent a hand in germany at the 2006 world cup germany is planning to set up a comprehensive cooperative deal with its eastern neighbor , poland , next year , and so polish police were also on hand to observe the protests .
in turn , many german police officers are scheduled to go to poland and ukraine for the euro 2012 football tournament .
" all this is nothing new .
for example , at the 2006 world cup in germany , polish police were here in hanover helping us keep the peace , " dirk hallmann , a spokesperson for the interior ministry in lower saxony , told deutsche welle .
" in the case of football , we have set up a european network because hooligans have no respect for borders .
they travel with their clubs or national teams for games all over the continent .
for this reason , there 's a clear exchange system between european police forces , coordinated and agreed upon in advance . "
hallmann praises this setup , saying it helps local forces learn about potential troublemakers among the traveling fans , and allows police to be better prepared - in terms of numbers , language skills and background knowledge - to prevent or stop any problems .
as chancellor angela merkel 's government tries to push through a controversial measure to export some german nuclear waste to russia , it 's not clear whether german police would be deployed in russia or european transit countries if protests similar to those in lower saxony last week were to take place - as some german action groups have already threatened .
this could not be arranged under the pruem convention as it stands currently , but in the case of poland , a future bilateral police deal with germany might cover such an operation .
and looking at the example of football hooliganism , it seems police from different countries can find ways to work together , if they see a need to .

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .
speaking at sunday 's opening ceremony , a former us prosecutor called for the nuremberg spirit to continue to be upheld today . sixty-five years after the opening of the nuremberg trials , the courtroom that witnessed nazi leaders being found guilty of war crimes has been transformed into a museum commemorating the momentous events which saw the eyes of the world fixed on this bavarian city .
benjamin ferencz , a former us prosecutor in the war crimes trials , and one of the few people participants still alive to have taken part in the trials , returned to nuremberg at the age of 90 to speak at the opening of the museum on the anniversary of the world 's first war crimes trial .
speaking at the inauguration of the new museum , ferencz said , " when i left germany for the first time after world war ii and left nuremberg , my biggest regret was that i never heard from any german saying ' i 'm sorry . '
i would never have believed that i would come back 60 years later and would hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country . "
collecting evidence at just 27 , ferencz was the chief prosecutor at the trial of 22 nazis in 1947 , one of the 12 trials that followed the trial of the major war criminals .
after graduating from harvard law school in 1943 he immediately joined the us army , gathering evidence of nazi crimes as the americans liberated the death camps buchenwald , mauthausen and dachau .
speaking in the courtroom in which he led the case for the prosecution in 1947 , ferencz said , " i 've seen the crematoria with the bodies packed outside and the bodies burning inside ...
i have seen the destruction of german cities , of french cities , of british cities ...
i do n't know if we will ever turn the page completely , people will always doubt whether it is possible for human beings to behave in such an inhumane way . "
bildunterschrift : allied flags decorate the exterior of the building fair trials during the war , soviet leader joseph stalin called for the mass executions of german soldiers and nazi leaders to be carried out when victory was won .
in contrast , britain , france and the usa demanded that the nazi perpetrators answer for their crimes in a front of a legal court .
it was this insistence which led to the international military tribunal opening its first court session on november 20 , 1945 in courtroom 600 at the palace of justice in nuremberg .
while nazi leaders adolf hitler and heinrich himmler escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of the war , 21 other leading nazis were put on trial in nuremberg .
under the spotlight of the world 's media , the city associated with fanatical nazi rallies was reborn as the city which hosted the first ever war crimes trial .
named the ' trial of the century ' by the media , it lasted 218 days before the accused were led to the dock to hear judgment on october 1 , 1946 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goering committed suicide before his death sentence was carried out although hermann goering escaped his sentence by committing suicide shortly before he was due to be hanged , foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop and the head of the armed forces , wilhelm keitel , were hanged in nuremberg prison in october 1946 along with eight others .
the very dock in which hermann goering and other leading nazis were sentenced to death is now part of the new memorium exhibition housed in an attic area above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
lingering cases the inauguration of the museum , which was attended by the german and russian foreign ministers as well as representatives of the united states , france and great britain , symbolizes the gradual end of nazi war crimes being pursued in the courts , leaving the history books to judge those who may have escaped justice .
earlier this month , michael seifert , known as the ‘ butcher of bolzano , ' died at the age of 86 in an italian hospital after being extradited to italy from canada in 2008 .
he was serving a prison sentence for murdering 11 people at a prison camp in bolzano .
seifert was one of the few nazi war criminals still known to be alive .
few witnesses from the time remain , making it increasingly difficult for the courts to continue the work started in nuremberg at the end of the war .
the ongoing trial of 90-year-old john demjanjuk , accused of murdering 27,000 at the sobidor death camp in poland , may prove the last time a suspected nazi war criminal is seen in the dock .
precursor of the icc the nuremberg trials leave a legacy that extends beyond the nazi period .
at the outset of the trial in 1946 , us chief prosecutor robert h. jackson proclaimed , " the wrongs which we seem to condemn and punish have been ... so devastating , that civilization can not tolerate their being ignored , because it can not survive their being repeated . "
bildunterschrift : two original courtroom benches , and old film images , are part of the exhibit .
despite jackson 's words , courthouse 600 was not the last court to hear allegations of war crimes .
the nuremberg trials paved the way for the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , as well as being the first court to establish the legal precedent of crimes against humanity .
in the late 1940s the court at nuremberg was the target of much criticism .
the trials were held in difficult circumstances , and some historians believe they would have been carried out differently with hindsight .
yet nuremberg is still seen as a model , having established a theory of international law which holds that the perpetrators of such crimes be held to account for their actions .
ferencz bore witness to this at the end of the war , and on sunday used his speech as an opportunity to criticize those countries who , he says , are not giving their full support to the icc , those whom he believes , have lost the spirit of nuremberg .
" the object is not to punish people for crimes against humanity , " he said .
" the object is to prevent those crimes ; by the time you are punishing you have failed . "
quoting judge jackson , ferencz argued that aggression is the supreme international crime , and the law must be applied equally to everyone .
looking down at the podium , the former chief prosecutor then asked the audience , " how far have we come ? " author : naomi scherbel-ball , nuremberg editor : ben knight the museum exhibit is held in the attic above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
the courtroom will however be open to the public when not in use . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .
speaking at sunday 's opening ceremony , a former us prosecutor called for the nuremberg spirit to continue to be upheld today . sixty-five years after the opening of the nuremberg trials , the courtroom that witnessed nazi leaders being found guilty of war crimes has been transformed into a museum commemorating the momentous events which saw the eyes of the world fixed on this bavarian city .
benjamin ferencz , a former us prosecutor in the war crimes trials , and one of the few people participants still alive to have taken part in the trials , returned to nuremberg at the age of 90 to speak at the opening of the museum on the anniversary of the world 's first war crimes trial .
speaking at the inauguration of the new museum , ferencz said , " when i left germany for the first time after world war ii and left nuremberg , my biggest regret was that i never heard from any german saying ' i 'm sorry . '
i would never have believed that i would come back 60 years later and would hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country . "
collecting evidence at just 27 , ferencz was the chief prosecutor at the trial of 22 nazis in 1947 , one of the 12 trials that followed the trial of the major war criminals .
after graduating from harvard law school in 1943 he immediately joined the us army , gathering evidence of nazi crimes as the americans liberated the death camps buchenwald , mauthausen and dachau .
speaking in the courtroom in which he led the case for the prosecution in 1947 , ferencz said , " i 've seen the crematoria with the bodies packed outside and the bodies burning inside ...
i have seen the destruction of german cities , of french cities , of british cities ...
i do n't know if we will ever turn the page completely , people will always doubt whether it is possible for human beings to behave in such an inhumane way . "
bildunterschrift : allied flags decorate the exterior of the building fair trials during the war , soviet leader joseph stalin called for the mass executions of german soldiers and nazi leaders to be carried out when victory was won .
in contrast , britain , france and the usa demanded that the nazi perpetrators answer for their crimes in a front of a legal court .
it was this insistence which led to the international military tribunal opening its first court session on november 20 , 1945 in courtroom 600 at the palace of justice in nuremberg .
while nazi leaders adolf hitler and heinrich himmler escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of the war , 21 other leading nazis were put on trial in nuremberg .
under the spotlight of the world 's media , the city associated with fanatical nazi rallies was reborn as the city which hosted the first ever war crimes trial .
named the ' trial of the century ' by the media , it lasted 218 days before the accused were led to the dock to hear judgment on october 1 , 1946 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goering committed suicide before his death sentence was carried out although hermann goering escaped his sentence by committing suicide shortly before he was due to be hanged , foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop and the head of the armed forces , wilhelm keitel , were hanged in nuremberg prison in october 1946 along with eight others .
the very dock in which hermann goering and other leading nazis were sentenced to death is now part of the new memorium exhibition housed in an attic area above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .
lingering cases the inauguration of the museum , which was attended by the german and russian foreign ministers as well as representatives of the united states , france and great britain , symbolizes the gradual end of nazi war crimes being pursued in the courts , leaving the history books to judge those who may have escaped justice .
earlier this month , michael seifert , known as the ‘ butcher of bolzano , ' died at the age of 86 in an italian hospital after being extradited to italy from canada in 2008 .
he was serving a prison sentence for murdering 11 people at a prison camp in bolzano .
seifert was one of the few nazi war criminals still known to be alive .
few witnesses from the time remain , making it increasingly difficult for the courts to continue the work started in nuremberg at the end of the war .
the ongoing trial of 90-year-old john demjanjuk , accused of murdering 27,000 at the sobidor death camp in poland , may prove the last time a suspected nazi war criminal is seen in the dock .
precursor of the icc the nuremberg trials leave a legacy that extends beyond the nazi period .
at the outset of the trial in 1946 , us chief prosecutor robert h. jackson proclaimed , " the wrongs which we seem to condemn and punish have been ... so devastating , that civilization can not tolerate their being ignored , because it can not survive their being repeated . "
bildunterschrift : two original courtroom benches , and old film images , are part of the exhibit .
despite jackson 's words , courthouse 600 was not the last court to hear allegations of war crimes .
the nuremberg trials paved the way for the establishment of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , as well as being the first court to establish the legal precedent of crimes against humanity .
in the late 1940s the court at nuremberg was the target of much criticism .
the trials were held in difficult circumstances , and some historians believe they would have been carried out differently with hindsight .
yet nuremberg is still seen as a model , having established a theory of international law which holds that the perpetrators of such crimes be held to account for their actions .
ferencz bore witness to this at the end of the war , and on sunday used his speech as an opportunity to criticize those countries who , he says , are not giving their full support to the icc , those whom he believes , have lost the spirit of nuremberg .
" the object is not to punish people for crimes against humanity , " he said .
" the object is to prevent those crimes ; by the time you are punishing you have failed . "
quoting judge jackson , ferencz argued that aggression is the supreme international crime , and the law must be applied equally to everyone .
looking down at the podium , the former chief prosecutor then asked the audience , " how far have we come ? " author : naomi scherbel-ball , nuremberg editor : ben knight the museum exhibit is held in the attic above courtroom 600 , which remains an active criminal court .

and it was n't just german officers on hand .
european police can sometimes cross borders - and they do . police launched a massive operation earlier this month to bring a train transporting nuclear waste safely to its destination , as thousands of demonstrators sought to impede its progress .
the operation cost an estimated 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- , and authorities in germany are looking for ways to pass some of the costs on to the protesters .
however , it was n't just german law enforcement officers protecting the cargo as it headed to the nuclear waste storage facility in the northern german town of gorleben .
officers from france , poland , croatia and the netherlands were also on hand , in various capacities .
pictures of one french policeman apparently suppressing a protester by grabbing him around the neck have caused quite a stir in germany . christoph mueller , a lawyer based in berlin , has filed a complaint against another french policeman in a separate incident that he says he personally witnessed .
" i saw a french policeman , close to the castor transport , who grabbed an activist , talked animatedly to him , and then suppressed him somewhat violently , " mueller told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , it 's a punishable offence .
if a police officer from a foreign country uses force like that , then he has committed a crime under german law , unless he has the proper authorization .
the case will be investigated , and i understand it could carry a punishment of up to two years in prison . "
little-known , but influential treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people tried to block the path of the contentious cargo the french national police 's top authority , the dgpn , has issued a response , defending the actions of its officers who were accompanying the german federal police on their mission to keep the railway lines open .
some confusion was caused , however , by an apparent failure to notify state police in lower saxony - who were responsible for controlling the demonstrations , but not for protecting the railway tracks - about the presence of french officers before the operation began .
" the validity of this intervention can not be called into question , as the french police officer acted under the constant and effective direction of his german colleagues , " the dgpn said in an official statement , also saying that the operation had been organized under the pruem convention -lrb- sometimes called the pruem decision -rrb- , a european cross-border crime fighting arrangement that was signed in the german town of pruem in 2005 .
the french police also referred to article 28 of the treaty , part of which states that " arms , ammunition and equipment … may be used only in legitimate defense of officers themselves or others … the use of arms , ammunition and equipment shall be governed by the host state 's national law . "
austria , spain , germany , belgium , luxembourg , france , finland , slovenia , hungary , the netherlands , estonia and romania are all signatories to the pruem convention .
italy , portugal , greece , sweden , bulgaria and slovakia are seeking membership .
the convention is not technically a european union agreement , but is only open to member states . it is bound both by eu law and by the laws of the country where the police action occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european borders are still policed , but are more porous now schengen zone opened borders to criminals , but not police under the pruem deal , police can leave their home countries on an emergency impromptu basis - for instance , when pursuing criminals who cross one of the schengen zone 's open borders by car - or for pre-arranged appointments to deal with mass events or disasters , as was the case with the castor protests .
" legally , it 's absolutely ok , " ruediger holecek , a spokesman for the german trade union for police officers , told deutsche welle .
" our organization was one of the first to complain that once europe became border-less , criminals were gifted a massive area to operate in , but police were not . "
holecek said it made perfect sense to have french police operating in germany with these nuclear waste transports , because french environmental activists - aware that the public attitude towards nuclear power is much more positive closer to home , making it harder to drum up support for major demonstrations - often choose to join the ranks of protesters in germany instead .
" one thing that 's utterly clear , though , is that there 's no difference between any police officer - whether they 're from france , germany , the netherlands or anywhere else - serving here : all of them have to operate within the laws of the country they are in .
if an officer from abroad really has overreacted , or used excessive force , then the case will be investigated , just as it would with any german officer , " said holecek .
however , holecek also noted the high number of accusations of police misconduct at the anti-nuclear demonstrations , saying that some of the protesters saw any police intervention as excessive use of force , because of their passionate belief in their cause .
wider-reaching cooperation in some cases , international police cooperation can take place in europe outside the pruem convention , usually through bilateral deals between countries .
for instance , police from croatia - a non-eu member - present at the castor demonstrations were not there as part of the pruem convention , but had been granted permission to observe the operation in plain clothes for training purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police from 12 eu countries and switzerland lent a hand in germany at the 2006 world cup germany is planning to set up a comprehensive cooperative deal with its eastern neighbor , poland , next year , and so polish police were also on hand to observe the protests .
in turn , many german police officers are scheduled to go to poland and ukraine for the euro 2012 football tournament .
" all this is nothing new .
for example , at the 2006 world cup in germany , polish police were here in hanover helping us keep the peace , " dirk hallmann , a spokesperson for the interior ministry in lower saxony , told deutsche welle .
" in the case of football , we have set up a european network because hooligans have no respect for borders .
they travel with their clubs or national teams for games all over the continent .
for this reason , there 's a clear exchange system between european police forces , coordinated and agreed upon in advance . "
hallmann praises this setup , saying it helps local forces learn about potential troublemakers among the traveling fans , and allows police to be better prepared - in terms of numbers , language skills and background knowledge - to prevent or stop any problems .
as chancellor angela merkel 's government tries to push through a controversial measure to export some german nuclear waste to russia , it 's not clear whether german police would be deployed in russia or european transit countries if protests similar to those in lower saxony last week were to take place - as some german action groups have already threatened .
this could not be arranged under the pruem convention as it stands currently , but in the case of poland , a future bilateral police deal with germany might cover such an operation .
and looking at the example of football hooliganism , it seems police from different countries can find ways to work together , if they see a need to .

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .

they have been incarcerated since october 10 . the sunday edition of europe 's best-selling newspaper has made a public appeal for the return of two of its journalists who have been imprisoned in iran .
the two men - a reporter and a photographer for bild am sonntag - were arrested on october 10 while interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani , a woman sentenced to death by stoning for murder and adultery .
bild 's front page read : " we are greatly concerned over two colleagues . "
the reporters were initially accused of not having proper accreditation after entering iran on tourist visas .
they have since been accused of espionage which carries much stronger penalties .
accusations are ' absurd ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper launched its appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television in an editorial , bild am sonntag 's editor-in-chief walter mayer wrote that the allegations that the two are spies and not journalists is " absurd . "
" the iranian authorities know perfectly well that they are journalists and nothing else , " wrote mayer .
the newspaper said it had decided to launch a public appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television earlier this week , apparently admitting to their wrongdoings .

and it was n't just german officers on hand .
european police can sometimes cross borders - and they do . police launched a massive operation earlier this month to bring a train transporting nuclear waste safely to its destination , as thousands of demonstrators sought to impede its progress .
the operation cost an estimated 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- , and authorities in germany are looking for ways to pass some of the costs on to the protesters .
however , it was n't just german law enforcement officers protecting the cargo as it headed to the nuclear waste storage facility in the northern german town of gorleben .
officers from france , poland , croatia and the netherlands were also on hand , in various capacities .
pictures of one french policeman apparently suppressing a protester by grabbing him around the neck have caused quite a stir in germany . christoph mueller , a lawyer based in berlin , has filed a complaint against another french policeman in a separate incident that he says he personally witnessed .
" i saw a french policeman , close to the castor transport , who grabbed an activist , talked animatedly to him , and then suppressed him somewhat violently , " mueller told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , it 's a punishable offence .
if a police officer from a foreign country uses force like that , then he has committed a crime under german law , unless he has the proper authorization .
the case will be investigated , and i understand it could carry a punishment of up to two years in prison . "
little-known , but influential treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people tried to block the path of the contentious cargo the french national police 's top authority , the dgpn , has issued a response , defending the actions of its officers who were accompanying the german federal police on their mission to keep the railway lines open .
some confusion was caused , however , by an apparent failure to notify state police in lower saxony - who were responsible for controlling the demonstrations , but not for protecting the railway tracks - about the presence of french officers before the operation began .
" the validity of this intervention can not be called into question , as the french police officer acted under the constant and effective direction of his german colleagues , " the dgpn said in an official statement , also saying that the operation had been organized under the pruem convention -lrb- sometimes called the pruem decision -rrb- , a european cross-border crime fighting arrangement that was signed in the german town of pruem in 2005 .
the french police also referred to article 28 of the treaty , part of which states that " arms , ammunition and equipment … may be used only in legitimate defense of officers themselves or others … the use of arms , ammunition and equipment shall be governed by the host state 's national law . "
austria , spain , germany , belgium , luxembourg , france , finland , slovenia , hungary , the netherlands , estonia and romania are all signatories to the pruem convention .
italy , portugal , greece , sweden , bulgaria and slovakia are seeking membership .
the convention is not technically a european union agreement , but is only open to member states . it is bound both by eu law and by the laws of the country where the police action occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european borders are still policed , but are more porous now schengen zone opened borders to criminals , but not police under the pruem deal , police can leave their home countries on an emergency impromptu basis - for instance , when pursuing criminals who cross one of the schengen zone 's open borders by car - or for pre-arranged appointments to deal with mass events or disasters , as was the case with the castor protests .
" legally , it 's absolutely ok , " ruediger holecek , a spokesman for the german trade union for police officers , told deutsche welle .
" our organization was one of the first to complain that once europe became border-less , criminals were gifted a massive area to operate in , but police were not . "
holecek said it made perfect sense to have french police operating in germany with these nuclear waste transports , because french environmental activists - aware that the public attitude towards nuclear power is much more positive closer to home , making it harder to drum up support for major demonstrations - often choose to join the ranks of protesters in germany instead .
" one thing that 's utterly clear , though , is that there 's no difference between any police officer - whether they 're from france , germany , the netherlands or anywhere else - serving here : all of them have to operate within the laws of the country they are in .
if an officer from abroad really has overreacted , or used excessive force , then the case will be investigated , just as it would with any german officer , " said holecek .
however , holecek also noted the high number of accusations of police misconduct at the anti-nuclear demonstrations , saying that some of the protesters saw any police intervention as excessive use of force , because of their passionate belief in their cause .
wider-reaching cooperation in some cases , international police cooperation can take place in europe outside the pruem convention , usually through bilateral deals between countries .
for instance , police from croatia - a non-eu member - present at the castor demonstrations were not there as part of the pruem convention , but had been granted permission to observe the operation in plain clothes for training purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police from 12 eu countries and switzerland lent a hand in germany at the 2006 world cup germany is planning to set up a comprehensive cooperative deal with its eastern neighbor , poland , next year , and so polish police were also on hand to observe the protests .
in turn , many german police officers are scheduled to go to poland and ukraine for the euro 2012 football tournament .
" all this is nothing new .
for example , at the 2006 world cup in germany , polish police were here in hanover helping us keep the peace , " dirk hallmann , a spokesperson for the interior ministry in lower saxony , told deutsche welle .
" in the case of football , we have set up a european network because hooligans have no respect for borders .
they travel with their clubs or national teams for games all over the continent .
for this reason , there 's a clear exchange system between european police forces , coordinated and agreed upon in advance . "
hallmann praises this setup , saying it helps local forces learn about potential troublemakers among the traveling fans , and allows police to be better prepared - in terms of numbers , language skills and background knowledge - to prevent or stop any problems .
as chancellor angela merkel 's government tries to push through a controversial measure to export some german nuclear waste to russia , it 's not clear whether german police would be deployed in russia or european transit countries if protests similar to those in lower saxony last week were to take place - as some german action groups have already threatened .
this could not be arranged under the pruem convention as it stands currently , but in the case of poland , a future bilateral police deal with germany might cover such an operation .
and looking at the example of football hooliganism , it seems police from different countries can find ways to work together , if they see a need to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de policing -pipe- 21.11.2010 anti-nuclear demo highlights europe 's border-free policing policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this french officer 's use of force caused quite an uproar in germany the recent attempt to stop a train carrying nuclear waste to a german storage site prompted a huge police response .
and it was n't just german officers on hand .
european police can sometimes cross borders - and they do . police launched a massive operation earlier this month to bring a train transporting nuclear waste safely to its destination , as thousands of demonstrators sought to impede its progress .
the operation cost an estimated 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 million -rrb- , and authorities in germany are looking for ways to pass some of the costs on to the protesters .
however , it was n't just german law enforcement officers protecting the cargo as it headed to the nuclear waste storage facility in the northern german town of gorleben .
officers from france , poland , croatia and the netherlands were also on hand , in various capacities .
pictures of one french policeman apparently suppressing a protester by grabbing him around the neck have caused quite a stir in germany . christoph mueller , a lawyer based in berlin , has filed a complaint against another french policeman in a separate incident that he says he personally witnessed .
" i saw a french policeman , close to the castor transport , who grabbed an activist , talked animatedly to him , and then suppressed him somewhat violently , " mueller told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , it 's a punishable offence .
if a police officer from a foreign country uses force like that , then he has committed a crime under german law , unless he has the proper authorization .
the case will be investigated , and i understand it could carry a punishment of up to two years in prison . "
little-known , but influential treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people tried to block the path of the contentious cargo the french national police 's top authority , the dgpn , has issued a response , defending the actions of its officers who were accompanying the german federal police on their mission to keep the railway lines open .
some confusion was caused , however , by an apparent failure to notify state police in lower saxony - who were responsible for controlling the demonstrations , but not for protecting the railway tracks - about the presence of french officers before the operation began .
" the validity of this intervention can not be called into question , as the french police officer acted under the constant and effective direction of his german colleagues , " the dgpn said in an official statement , also saying that the operation had been organized under the pruem convention -lrb- sometimes called the pruem decision -rrb- , a european cross-border crime fighting arrangement that was signed in the german town of pruem in 2005 .
the french police also referred to article 28 of the treaty , part of which states that " arms , ammunition and equipment … may be used only in legitimate defense of officers themselves or others … the use of arms , ammunition and equipment shall be governed by the host state 's national law . "
austria , spain , germany , belgium , luxembourg , france , finland , slovenia , hungary , the netherlands , estonia and romania are all signatories to the pruem convention .
italy , portugal , greece , sweden , bulgaria and slovakia are seeking membership .
the convention is not technically a european union agreement , but is only open to member states . it is bound both by eu law and by the laws of the country where the police action occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european borders are still policed , but are more porous now schengen zone opened borders to criminals , but not police under the pruem deal , police can leave their home countries on an emergency impromptu basis - for instance , when pursuing criminals who cross one of the schengen zone 's open borders by car - or for pre-arranged appointments to deal with mass events or disasters , as was the case with the castor protests .
" legally , it 's absolutely ok , " ruediger holecek , a spokesman for the german trade union for police officers , told deutsche welle .
" our organization was one of the first to complain that once europe became border-less , criminals were gifted a massive area to operate in , but police were not . "
holecek said it made perfect sense to have french police operating in germany with these nuclear waste transports , because french environmental activists - aware that the public attitude towards nuclear power is much more positive closer to home , making it harder to drum up support for major demonstrations - often choose to join the ranks of protesters in germany instead .
" one thing that 's utterly clear , though , is that there 's no difference between any police officer - whether they 're from france , germany , the netherlands or anywhere else - serving here : all of them have to operate within the laws of the country they are in .
if an officer from abroad really has overreacted , or used excessive force , then the case will be investigated , just as it would with any german officer , " said holecek .
however , holecek also noted the high number of accusations of police misconduct at the anti-nuclear demonstrations , saying that some of the protesters saw any police intervention as excessive use of force , because of their passionate belief in their cause .
wider-reaching cooperation in some cases , international police cooperation can take place in europe outside the pruem convention , usually through bilateral deals between countries .
for instance , police from croatia - a non-eu member - present at the castor demonstrations were not there as part of the pruem convention , but had been granted permission to observe the operation in plain clothes for training purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police from 12 eu countries and switzerland lent a hand in germany at the 2006 world cup germany is planning to set up a comprehensive cooperative deal with its eastern neighbor , poland , next year , and so polish police were also on hand to observe the protests .
in turn , many german police officers are scheduled to go to poland and ukraine for the euro 2012 football tournament .
" all this is nothing new .
for example , at the 2006 world cup in germany , polish police were here in hanover helping us keep the peace , " dirk hallmann , a spokesperson for the interior ministry in lower saxony , told deutsche welle .
" in the case of football , we have set up a european network because hooligans have no respect for borders .
they travel with their clubs or national teams for games all over the continent .
for this reason , there 's a clear exchange system between european police forces , coordinated and agreed upon in advance . "
hallmann praises this setup , saying it helps local forces learn about potential troublemakers among the traveling fans , and allows police to be better prepared - in terms of numbers , language skills and background knowledge - to prevent or stop any problems .
as chancellor angela merkel 's government tries to push through a controversial measure to export some german nuclear waste to russia , it 's not clear whether german police would be deployed in russia or european transit countries if protests similar to those in lower saxony last week were to take place - as some german action groups have already threatened .
this could not be arranged under the pruem convention as it stands currently , but in the case of poland , a future bilateral police deal with germany might cover such an operation .
and looking at the example of football hooliganism , it seems police from different countries can find ways to work together , if they see a need to .

bild 's front page read : " we are greatly concerned over two colleagues . "

accusations are ' absurd ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper launched its appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television in an editorial , bild am sonntag 's editor-in-chief walter mayer wrote that the allegations that the two are spies and not journalists is " absurd .

the newspaper said it had decided to launch a public appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television earlier this week , apparently admitting to their wrongdoings .
" we see that they are doing badly , that they are suffering , " mayer wrote , appealing , " both must come home soon ! "
on friday , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called on iran to respect international law in its treatment of the journalists , including regular consular access and " appropriate custodial conditions . "

he said the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's stance on contraception . pope benedict xvi has said in a new book that using condoms may sometimes be justified to stop the spread of aids .
the comments appear to soften the vatican 's strong opposition to condoms on the grounds they are a form of artificial contraception .
benedict said that for male prostitutes - for whom contraception is not a major issue - condoms are " not a moral solution . "
but he said they could be justified " in the intention of reducing the risk of infection . "
the pope made the comments during 20 hours of interviews with german journalist peter seewald .
the remarks will be published in seewald 's new book : " light of the world : the pope , the church and the signs of the times . "
the vatican newspaper published some excerpts of the book ahead of its release on tuesday .
the pope was asked by seewald whether the catholic church is fundamentally against the use of condoms .
" it of course does not see it as a real and moral solution , " the pope responded .
" in certain cases , where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection , it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another , more humane sexuality , " against church teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope caused an outcry in 2009 over comments about fighting aids in africa until now , the vatican has prohibited the use of any form of contraception , even as a barrier against sexually transmitted diseases .
the hard-line stance has drawn international criticism .
last year , when benedict visited aids-ravaged africa , he told reporters the disease was a tragedy that " can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems . "
in the new book , the pope says that in certain cases using a condom may be the first step towards taking responsibility , using the example of male prostitutes . he reiterated that it was " not the proper way to deal with the horror of hiv infection . "
benedict made it clear that the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's fundamental opposition to artificial birth control , a source of grievance to many practicing catholics .
while some roman catholic leaders have spoken about the limited use of condoms to stop the spread of aids as the lesser of two evils , this is the first time the pope has mentioned such an idea in public .
the new book by catholic journalist seewald , set to be translated into 18 languages , arose after a series of interviews with the pontiff conducted in german in july 2010 .
the book addresses a number of other sensitive issues , including the scandals over abusive priests in the catholic church , the debate about celibacy in the church and female ordination .

nuremberg trials museum opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courtroom 600 is still a functioning court memorium , a new museum commemorating the nuremberg trials , opened this week .
speaking at sunday 's opening ceremony , a former us prosecutor called for the nuremberg spirit to continue to be upheld today . sixty-five years after the opening of the nuremberg trials , the courtroom that witnessed nazi leaders being found guilty of war crimes has been transformed into a museum commemorating the momentous events which saw the eyes of the world fixed on this bavarian city .
benjamin ferencz , a former us prosecutor in the war crimes trials , and one of the few people participants still alive to have taken part in the trials , returned to nuremberg at the age of 90 to speak at the opening of the museum on the anniversary of the world 's first war crimes trial .
speaking at the inauguration of the new museum , ferencz said , " when i left germany for the first time after world war ii and left nuremberg , my biggest regret was that i never heard from any german saying ' i 'm sorry . '
i would never have believed that i would come back 60 years later and would hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country . "
collecting evidence at just 27 , ferencz was the chief prosecutor at the trial of 22 nazis in 1947 , one of the 12 trials that followed the trial of the major war criminals .
after graduating from harvard law school in 1943 he immediately joined the us army , gathering evidence of nazi crimes as the americans liberated the death camps buchenwald , mauthausen and dachau .
speaking in the courtroom in which he led the case for the prosecution in 1947 , ferencz said , " i 've seen the crematoria with the bodies packed outside and the bodies burning inside ...
i have seen the destruction of german cities , of french cities , of british cities ...
i do n't know if we will ever turn the page completely , people will always doubt whether it is possible for human beings to behave in such an inhumane way . "

in contrast , britain , france and the usa demanded that the nazi perpetrators answer for their crimes in a front of a legal court .
it was this insistence which led to the international military tribunal opening its first court session on november 20 , 1945 in courtroom 600 at the palace of justice in nuremberg .
while nazi leaders adolf hitler and heinrich himmler escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of the war , 21 other leading nazis were put on trial in nuremberg .

in the late 1940s the court at nuremberg was the target of much criticism .
the trials were held in difficult circumstances , and some historians believe they would have been carried out differently with hindsight .
yet nuremberg is still seen as a model , having established a theory of international law which holds that the perpetrators of such crimes be held to account for their actions .
ferencz bore witness to this at the end of the war , and on sunday used his speech as an opportunity to criticize those countries who , he says , are not giving their full support to the icc , those whom he believes , have lost the spirit of nuremberg .

" the object is to prevent those crimes ; by the time you are punishing you have failed . "

they have been incarcerated since october 10 . the sunday edition of europe 's best-selling newspaper has made a public appeal for the return of two of its journalists who have been imprisoned in iran .
the two men - a reporter and a photographer for bild am sonntag - were arrested on october 10 while interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani , a woman sentenced to death by stoning for murder and adultery .
bild 's front page read : " we are greatly concerned over two colleagues . "

they have since been accused of espionage which carries much stronger penalties .
accusations are ' absurd ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper launched its appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television in an editorial , bild am sonntag 's editor-in-chief walter mayer wrote that the allegations that the two are spies and not journalists is " absurd .

" the iranian authorities know perfectly well that they are journalists and nothing else , " wrote mayer .
the newspaper said it had decided to launch a public appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television earlier this week , apparently admitting to their wrongdoings .
" we see that they are doing badly , that they are suffering , " mayer wrote , appealing , " both must come home soon ! "
on friday , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called on iran to respect international law in its treatment of the journalists , including regular consular access and " appropriate custodial conditions . "

they have been incarcerated since october 10 . the sunday edition of europe 's best-selling newspaper has made a public appeal for the return of two of its journalists who have been imprisoned in iran .
the two men - a reporter and a photographer for bild am sonntag - were arrested on october 10 while interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani , a woman sentenced to death by stoning for murder and adultery .
bild 's front page read : " we are greatly concerned over two colleagues . "
the reporters were initially accused of not having proper accreditation after entering iran on tourist visas .
they have since been accused of espionage which carries much stronger penalties .
accusations are ' absurd ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper launched its appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television in an editorial , bild am sonntag 's editor-in-chief walter mayer wrote that the allegations that the two are spies and not journalists is " absurd . "
" the iranian authorities know perfectly well that they are journalists and nothing else , " wrote mayer .
the newspaper said it had decided to launch a public appeal after the reporters were shown on iranian state television earlier this week , apparently admitting to their wrongdoings .
" we see that they are doing badly , that they are suffering , " mayer wrote , appealing , " both must come home soon ! "
on friday , german foreign minister guido westerwelle called on iran to respect international law in its treatment of the journalists , including regular consular access and " appropriate custodial conditions . "

he said the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's stance on contraception . pope benedict xvi has said in a new book that using condoms may sometimes be justified to stop the spread of aids .
the comments appear to soften the vatican 's strong opposition to condoms on the grounds they are a form of artificial contraception .
benedict said that for male prostitutes - for whom contraception is not a major issue - condoms are " not a moral solution . "
but he said they could be justified " in the intention of reducing the risk of infection . "
the pope made the comments during 20 hours of interviews with german journalist peter seewald .
the remarks will be published in seewald 's new book : " light of the world : the pope , the church and the signs of the times . "
the vatican newspaper published some excerpts of the book ahead of its release on tuesday .
the pope was asked by seewald whether the catholic church is fundamentally against the use of condoms .
" it of course does not see it as a real and moral solution , " the pope responded .
" in certain cases , where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection , it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another , more humane sexuality , " against church teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope caused an outcry in 2009 over comments about fighting aids in africa until now , the vatican has prohibited the use of any form of contraception , even as a barrier against sexually transmitted diseases .
the hard-line stance has drawn international criticism .
last year , when benedict visited aids-ravaged africa , he told reporters the disease was a tragedy that " can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems . "
in the new book , the pope says that in certain cases using a condom may be the first step towards taking responsibility , using the example of male prostitutes . he reiterated that it was " not the proper way to deal with the horror of hiv infection . "
benedict made it clear that the comments were not intended to weaken the church 's fundamental opposition to artificial birth control , a source of grievance to many practicing catholics .
while some roman catholic leaders have spoken about the limited use of condoms to stop the spread of aids as the lesser of two evils , this is the first time the pope has mentioned such an idea in public .
the new book by catholic journalist seewald , set to be translated into 18 languages , arose after a series of interviews with the pontiff conducted in german in july 2010 .
the book addresses a number of other sensitive issues , including the scandals over abusive priests in the catholic church , the debate about celibacy in the church and female ordination .
