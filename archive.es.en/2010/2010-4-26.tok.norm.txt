the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- says they amount to a record 350 cases - the highest number yet . of the 350 preliminary investigations into suspected islamist terrorists , 220 inquiries are currently being handled by germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , and " almost half of those are aimed at finding the perpetrators of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , " bka chief joerg ziercke said . under german law , attacks on german nationals anywhere are a crime and must be investigated if a complaint is made .
however , according to guido steinberg , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , the upsurge in proceedings against islamist terror suspects is not only due to attacks on german soldiers in afghanistan that are prosecuted here in germany .
" a kind of german jihadist scene has emerged since 2006 , and that is also why the number of people under scrutiny has risen , " steinberg told deutsche welle .
" associates of islamic terrorism " the bka considers about 1,100 people in germany to be part of an " islamist terrorist personnel potential . "
" nationwide , security forces have an eye on 127 potentially threatening individuals , " ziercke told the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are increasingly targeted by taliban insurgents since the beginning of last year , there has been an increase in the number of germans travelling to islamist training camps , zierke said .
" more than 30 young germans went to afghanistan or pakistan in 2009 . "
" there 's a german community in the area now .
a group of 10-12 people is trying to lure others with german-language propaganda , " he said .
" unfortunately , they are successful . "
a kind of pipeline the germans in pakistani islamic training camps were showing their countrymen how to get terrorist training there , guido steinberg said .
" they serve as a kind of role model . "
steinberg said there was speculation about whether german nationals were participating in attacks on german soldiers in afghanistan .
" some germans have joined the islamic movement of uzbekistan , which is taking part in attacks on german soldiers , but there is no evidence that germans take part in these attacks , " he said .
" but that might happen at any time since , obviously , there is an interest on their part to fight german soldiers . "

members of the bishops ’ conference decided that more emphasis should be placed on victims . catholic bishops met in the german city of wuerzburg on monday to discuss draft guidelines on dealing with allegations of sexual abuse more effectively .
" we have reworked the guidelines and made them clearer and more precise , " said the conference representative on abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , referring to recently drafted rules .
the trier bishop said that he was optimistic the next meeting of the bishops ' conference could ratify the guidelines in june .
ackerman worked together with an expert group to draw up the new measures to protect children , which were received by bishops late last week .
he added that the church would not seek to protect priests who broke criminal laws . " it must be clear beyond doubt that we do not claim any legal status separate from civil law , " said ackermann .
victims ' point of view the revised guidelines are intended to address the issue more from the perspective of the victims .
there is also a greater emphasis on prevention of abuse .
ackerman said that the selection and qualification of commissioners who would be responsible for the issue of child abuse had also been addressed .

his goal is to get a foot in the door for german business ahead of the 2014 football world cup and 2016 olympics to be hosted by the emerging economic powerhouse .
but it is not only a mutual love of football that bruederle will be using to bridge the divide between the two countries .
brazilians have also taken to heart , and stomach , the german art of brewing beer .
the setting is a modestly sized city called blumenau , which most would assume lies somewhere near the black forest or perhaps along one of germany 's many rivers .
however this city can not be found in germany , or anywhere on the european continent .
it lies in the south of brazil and has become home to what it claims is the world 's second-largest beer festival after oktoberfest in munich .
the city was founded by germans around 160 years ago and is now home to hundreds of thousands of their descendents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenau is a home away from home for germans the city hosts a collection of small breweries that have carried on the world-renowned tradition of german beer-making under the labels " eisenbahn , " " schornstein , " and simply " das bier . "
lasting legacy master brewer claudio jose gonzales de matos says brazilians have taken up beer making and drinking with as much passion as the germans who brought their special recipes to the country so long ago .
" we live here in a tropical country and year after year , beer consumption has continued to rise substantially .
in particular , small breweries here in brazil are growing very fast , " he says .
" they have revived the traditional brewing techniques and distanced themselves from the more modern industrial-style methods .
today , there are many small breweries in brazil producing beer of high quality . "
every year , brazilians consume around 10 billion liters of beer - just one billion short of germans - and the south american country now represents the fourth-largest beer market in the world .
mass produced , mainstream beer labels still dominate in brazil , but small breweries are staging a comeback , and have trebled their market share to six percent in recent years .
bildunterschrift : brazilians are warming to beer culture solid foundation brewer pedro paulo moretzohn , who spent many years perfecting his brewing techniques in europe , believes that german beer-making methods are underpinning the fight back of micro-breweries in brazil .
" these new enterprises sprang mainly from german culture in cities like blumenau and others nearby , " he says .
" but also because people want beers with a variety of tastes .
here our beers are virtually without additives - nothing other than grain varieties such as malt , hops and wheat .
that gives these beers a very special characteristic . "
behind the boom are more than 100 micro-breweries producing " cervejas artesanais , " or hand-crafted beers , with varieties including yeast beers , dark beers and even koelsch-style beers popular in the areas surrounding the western german city of cologne .
despite the quality beer offered by micro-breweries , a mass-produced , light , watery version of a pilsner still dominates the brazilian market .
but brewing instructor ligia marcondes believes the market for high-quality beer is continuously growing in the country of nearly 190 million , especially among the middle class .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still enjoy their beer more than brazilians " for example , today i can say that i love hoppy beers , whereas earlier , i might have thought those beers were too bitter , " she says .
" at the moment i like wheat beer , but of course , i 'll still try new beers .
i like full-bodied beers .
bitter beers , too .
so you could say i have changed my consumption habits a little . "
raising the bar so successful have some micro-breweries been that they 've forced some larger brazilian breweries to rethink their beer-making ethos , leading to an improvement in the quality of some mass-produced labels .
brewing specialist cilene saorin says what is needed is a shift in paradigm by both beer makers and consumers .
" we need to work on our drinking culture and improve knowledge of beer culture , " she says .
" we have to explain that pilsner is not the only beer , but that there are over 100 different varieties and that different beers suit different occasions .
this process of education will take time " .
" we 've already made a lot of progress over the last five years .
give us another five years and you 'll see that the market will have evolved . "

his goal is to get a foot in the door for german business ahead of the 2014 football world cup and 2016 olympics to be hosted by the emerging economic powerhouse .
but it is not only a mutual love of football that bruederle will be using to bridge the divide between the two countries .
brazilians have also taken to heart , and stomach , the german art of brewing beer .
the setting is a modestly sized city called blumenau , which most would assume lies somewhere near the black forest or perhaps along one of germany 's many rivers .
however this city can not be found in germany , or anywhere on the european continent .
it lies in the south of brazil and has become home to what it claims is the world 's second-largest beer festival after oktoberfest in munich .
the city was founded by germans around 160 years ago and is now home to hundreds of thousands of their descendents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenau is a home away from home for germans the city hosts a collection of small breweries that have carried on the world-renowned tradition of german beer-making under the labels " eisenbahn , " " schornstein , " and simply " das bier . "
lasting legacy master brewer claudio jose gonzales de matos says brazilians have taken up beer making and drinking with as much passion as the germans who brought their special recipes to the country so long ago .
" we live here in a tropical country and year after year , beer consumption has continued to rise substantially .
in particular , small breweries here in brazil are growing very fast , " he says .
" they have revived the traditional brewing techniques and distanced themselves from the more modern industrial-style methods .
today , there are many small breweries in brazil producing beer of high quality . "
every year , brazilians consume around 10 billion liters of beer - just one billion short of germans - and the south american country now represents the fourth-largest beer market in the world .
mass produced , mainstream beer labels still dominate in brazil , but small breweries are staging a comeback , and have trebled their market share to six percent in recent years .
bildunterschrift : brazilians are warming to beer culture solid foundation brewer pedro paulo moretzohn , who spent many years perfecting his brewing techniques in europe , believes that german beer-making methods are underpinning the fight back of micro-breweries in brazil .
" these new enterprises sprang mainly from german culture in cities like blumenau and others nearby , " he says .
" but also because people want beers with a variety of tastes .
here our beers are virtually without additives - nothing other than grain varieties such as malt , hops and wheat .
that gives these beers a very special characteristic . "
behind the boom are more than 100 micro-breweries producing " cervejas artesanais , " or hand-crafted beers , with varieties including yeast beers , dark beers and even koelsch-style beers popular in the areas surrounding the western german city of cologne .
despite the quality beer offered by micro-breweries , a mass-produced , light , watery version of a pilsner still dominates the brazilian market .
but brewing instructor ligia marcondes believes the market for high-quality beer is continuously growing in the country of nearly 190 million , especially among the middle class .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still enjoy their beer more than brazilians " for example , today i can say that i love hoppy beers , whereas earlier , i might have thought those beers were too bitter , " she says .
" at the moment i like wheat beer , but of course , i 'll still try new beers .
i like full-bodied beers .
bitter beers , too .
so you could say i have changed my consumption habits a little . "
raising the bar so successful have some micro-breweries been that they 've forced some larger brazilian breweries to rethink their beer-making ethos , leading to an improvement in the quality of some mass-produced labels .
brewing specialist cilene saorin says what is needed is a shift in paradigm by both beer makers and consumers .
" we need to work on our drinking culture and improve knowledge of beer culture , " she says .
" we have to explain that pilsner is not the only beer , but that there are over 100 different varieties and that different beers suit different occasions .
this process of education will take time " .
" we 've already made a lot of progress over the last five years .
give us another five years and you 'll see that the market will have evolved . "

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.04.2010 cult clubs kaiserslautern and st. pauli are set for bundesliga return großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lautern fans gathered to watch the augsburg match that ensured their promotion the bundesliga will see the return of a familiar name next season , as former champions kaiserslautern get promoted .
and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .
back in black bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli fans are a colorful , fun-loving bunch if lautern are one of the bundesliga 's most storied teams , st. pauli are without doubt the hippest .
the club has only spent a total of five years in the first division and its greatest success was beating the then world club champions bayern munich , but results are not the source of its appeal .
the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .
back in black bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli fans are a colorful , fun-loving bunch if lautern are one of the bundesliga 's most storied teams , st. pauli are without doubt the hippest .
the club has only spent a total of five years in the first division and its greatest success was beating the then world club champions bayern munich , but results are not the source of its appeal .
the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .

many questions are being asked by politicians , the airlines and scientists about a phenomenon that could occur at any time and , according to past trends , could be even more severe .
airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by volcanoes .
jet engines can suck in volcanic ash , which melts in the intense heat . the turbine blades are then coated and can clog up and fail .
it has the makings of a potential catastrophe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1.2 million passengers per day were affected so when the huge cloud of ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano drifted into british airspace , the uk 's air industry regulator banned all commercial flights .
more than a dozen other countries - including germany and france - followed that example , closing their airspace either partially or fully .
" volcanic ash and jet engines do n't mix , so safety is our number one priority , " said bob jones , the uk regulator 's head of operations .
" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .
" where you have a small chance of that happening , it would be very wrong to say , let 's give it a try .
this is a matter of life and death . "
but as the flight ban dragged on , it quickly became more a matter of life and death for the airlines , which were losing about 150 million euros a day .
some were in danger of going under financially and they began to complain that the authorities had overreacted . incomplete analysis british weather forecasters used a computer program to predict where the wind would carry the ash cloud and how quickly it would disperse .
the program was first developed after the nuclear reactor accident at chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you balance economic fallout for airlines against passenger safety ?
britain 's met office says it is tried and tested .
but giovanni bisignani , head of the international air transport association , is angry that a great swathe of northern european airspace was closed purely on the basis of computer modeling .
" i call it a european mess because we did not focus on figures and facts .
europe was using a theoretical , mathematical approach .
that is not what we need , " he said .
" we need test flights to go into the atmosphere , assess the ashes and then take decisions . " in fact , it has emerged that the met office could not establish a complete picture of the cloud over britain until almost a week into the crisis because its specialist monitoring jet was out of action .
the bae 146 was the only plane equipped with state-of-the-art measuring instruments that could map the full extent of the ash .
yet by the fourth day of the shutdown , european airlines like lufthansa , klm and british airways had flown a number of their own test flights . they all reported no damage to their jet engines . peter sammonds , a volcanologist at university college , london , said this underlines the fact that it is not enough to rely solely on weather simulations . " that sort of initial monitoring of the volcano , the modeling by the met office , probably needs to be backed up with more intensive atmospheric sampling to try and map the distribution of the ash in the atmosphere somewhat more accurately to provide better input into what the next decision should be , " he said . low concentration test flights by research aircraft revealed interesting data .
the ash cloud contained basalt , not the more damaging substance andesite .
the ash concentration was also extremely low - no more than 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air .
jet engine manufacturers said the cloud would need to be about 20 times denser to damage turbine blades .
after six days , all european airspace was officially judged to be safe and all remaining flight restrictions were lifted .
it is estimated that the airlines lost more than a billion euros due to the shutdown .
european air traffic authorities admit they have been on a steep learning curve and now have a more flexible approach to volcanic ash .
just a preview just as well , according to iceland 's president olafur grimsson . more ash could be on the way - much more , in fact , when iceland 's giant katla volcano erupts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines have been vocal in their criticism of the blanket airspace closure " what we have seen now is in fact a small rehearsal of what would happen when katla will erupt , " he said .
" so i think it is high time for european governments and airline authorities all over europe and the world to start planning for it . "
katla erupts roughly once every one hundred years and the last time it lost its top was in 1918 .
siim kallas , the eu 's transport commissioner , has said he will begin working this week with colleagues to lay out a road map for similar events .
the list of questions he faces is daunting , ranging from determining the safety threshold for different engines , weighing potential danger against economic fallout and balancing passenger rights against the industry 's health .
" we needed a fast , coordinated european response to a crisis , " he told reporters .
" instead , we had a fragmented patchwork of 27 national airspaces .

many questions are being asked by politicians , the airlines and scientists about a phenomenon that could occur at any time and , according to past trends , could be even more severe .
airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by volcanoes .
jet engines can suck in volcanic ash , which melts in the intense heat . the turbine blades are then coated and can clog up and fail .
it has the makings of a potential catastrophe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1.2 million passengers per day were affected so when the huge cloud of ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano drifted into british airspace , the uk 's air industry regulator banned all commercial flights .
more than a dozen other countries - including germany and france - followed that example , closing their airspace either partially or fully .
" volcanic ash and jet engines do n't mix , so safety is our number one priority , " said bob jones , the uk regulator 's head of operations .
" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .
" where you have a small chance of that happening , it would be very wrong to say , let 's give it a try .
this is a matter of life and death . "
but as the flight ban dragged on , it quickly became more a matter of life and death for the airlines , which were losing about 150 million euros a day .
some were in danger of going under financially and they began to complain that the authorities had overreacted . incomplete analysis british weather forecasters used a computer program to predict where the wind would carry the ash cloud and how quickly it would disperse .
the program was first developed after the nuclear reactor accident at chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you balance economic fallout for airlines against passenger safety ?
britain 's met office says it is tried and tested .
but giovanni bisignani , head of the international air transport association , is angry that a great swathe of northern european airspace was closed purely on the basis of computer modeling .
" i call it a european mess because we did not focus on figures and facts .
europe was using a theoretical , mathematical approach .
that is not what we need , " he said .
" we need test flights to go into the atmosphere , assess the ashes and then take decisions . " in fact , it has emerged that the met office could not establish a complete picture of the cloud over britain until almost a week into the crisis because its specialist monitoring jet was out of action .
the bae 146 was the only plane equipped with state-of-the-art measuring instruments that could map the full extent of the ash .
yet by the fourth day of the shutdown , european airlines like lufthansa , klm and british airways had flown a number of their own test flights . they all reported no damage to their jet engines . peter sammonds , a volcanologist at university college , london , said this underlines the fact that it is not enough to rely solely on weather simulations . " that sort of initial monitoring of the volcano , the modeling by the met office , probably needs to be backed up with more intensive atmospheric sampling to try and map the distribution of the ash in the atmosphere somewhat more accurately to provide better input into what the next decision should be , " he said . low concentration test flights by research aircraft revealed interesting data .
the ash cloud contained basalt , not the more damaging substance andesite .
the ash concentration was also extremely low - no more than 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air .
jet engine manufacturers said the cloud would need to be about 20 times denser to damage turbine blades .
after six days , all european airspace was officially judged to be safe and all remaining flight restrictions were lifted .
it is estimated that the airlines lost more than a billion euros due to the shutdown .
european air traffic authorities admit they have been on a steep learning curve and now have a more flexible approach to volcanic ash .
just a preview just as well , according to iceland 's president olafur grimsson . more ash could be on the way - much more , in fact , when iceland 's giant katla volcano erupts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines have been vocal in their criticism of the blanket airspace closure " what we have seen now is in fact a small rehearsal of what would happen when katla will erupt , " he said .
" so i think it is high time for european governments and airline authorities all over europe and the world to start planning for it . "
katla erupts roughly once every one hundred years and the last time it lost its top was in 1918 .
siim kallas , the eu 's transport commissioner , has said he will begin working this week with colleagues to lay out a road map for similar events .
the list of questions he faces is daunting , ranging from determining the safety threshold for different engines , weighing potential danger against economic fallout and balancing passenger rights against the industry 's health .
" we needed a fast , coordinated european response to a crisis , " he told reporters .
" instead , we had a fragmented patchwork of 27 national airspaces .
we need a single european regulator for a single european sky . "
kallas has said he will propose speeding up the plan to unify control over all european skyways .

many questions are being asked by politicians , the airlines and scientists about a phenomenon that could occur at any time and , according to past trends , could be even more severe .
airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by volcanoes .
jet engines can suck in volcanic ash , which melts in the intense heat . the turbine blades are then coated and can clog up and fail .
it has the makings of a potential catastrophe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1.2 million passengers per day were affected so when the huge cloud of ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano drifted into british airspace , the uk 's air industry regulator banned all commercial flights .
more than a dozen other countries - including germany and france - followed that example , closing their airspace either partially or fully .
" volcanic ash and jet engines do n't mix , so safety is our number one priority , " said bob jones , the uk regulator 's head of operations .
" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .
" where you have a small chance of that happening , it would be very wrong to say , let 's give it a try .
this is a matter of life and death . "
but as the flight ban dragged on , it quickly became more a matter of life and death for the airlines , which were losing about 150 million euros a day .
some were in danger of going under financially and they began to complain that the authorities had overreacted . incomplete analysis british weather forecasters used a computer program to predict where the wind would carry the ash cloud and how quickly it would disperse .
the program was first developed after the nuclear reactor accident at chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you balance economic fallout for airlines against passenger safety ?
britain 's met office says it is tried and tested .
but giovanni bisignani , head of the international air transport association , is angry that a great swathe of northern european airspace was closed purely on the basis of computer modeling .
" i call it a european mess because we did not focus on figures and facts .
europe was using a theoretical , mathematical approach .
that is not what we need , " he said .
" we need test flights to go into the atmosphere , assess the ashes and then take decisions . " in fact , it has emerged that the met office could not establish a complete picture of the cloud over britain until almost a week into the crisis because its specialist monitoring jet was out of action .
the bae 146 was the only plane equipped with state-of-the-art measuring instruments that could map the full extent of the ash .
yet by the fourth day of the shutdown , european airlines like lufthansa , klm and british airways had flown a number of their own test flights . they all reported no damage to their jet engines . peter sammonds , a volcanologist at university college , london , said this underlines the fact that it is not enough to rely solely on weather simulations . " that sort of initial monitoring of the volcano , the modeling by the met office , probably needs to be backed up with more intensive atmospheric sampling to try and map the distribution of the ash in the atmosphere somewhat more accurately to provide better input into what the next decision should be , " he said . low concentration test flights by research aircraft revealed interesting data .
the ash cloud contained basalt , not the more damaging substance andesite .
the ash concentration was also extremely low - no more than 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air .
jet engine manufacturers said the cloud would need to be about 20 times denser to damage turbine blades .
after six days , all european airspace was officially judged to be safe and all remaining flight restrictions were lifted .
it is estimated that the airlines lost more than a billion euros due to the shutdown .
european air traffic authorities admit they have been on a steep learning curve and now have a more flexible approach to volcanic ash .
just a preview just as well , according to iceland 's president olafur grimsson . more ash could be on the way - much more , in fact , when iceland 's giant katla volcano erupts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines have been vocal in their criticism of the blanket airspace closure " what we have seen now is in fact a small rehearsal of what would happen when katla will erupt , " he said .
" so i think it is high time for european governments and airline authorities all over europe and the world to start planning for it . "
katla erupts roughly once every one hundred years and the last time it lost its top was in 1918 .
siim kallas , the eu 's transport commissioner , has said he will begin working this week with colleagues to lay out a road map for similar events .
the list of questions he faces is daunting , ranging from determining the safety threshold for different engines , weighing potential danger against economic fallout and balancing passenger rights against the industry 's health .
" we needed a fast , coordinated european response to a crisis , " he told reporters .
" instead , we had a fragmented patchwork of 27 national airspaces .
we need a single european regulator for a single european sky . "
kallas has said he will propose speeding up the plan to unify control over all european skyways .

now , after only nine months , he 's been given the pink slip , as the club tries to salvage its season .
but there 's little left to salvage . hamburg 's board of directors announced labbadia would be leaving the club involuntarily on monday , one day after the team suffered a disastrous 5-1 loss to hoffenheim in the bundesliga and three days before a crucial away tie to fulham in the europa league semi-finals .
" we can not and did not want to continue in this formation , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told reporters after meeting with labbadia .
" we found we could n't expect to win against fulham .
it was the last point at which we could act so as not to endanger our season goal of qualifying for europe . "
but hamburg 's chances are already in grave danger .
in seventh place in the table , and five points behind sixth-placed stuttgart , hamburg 's prospects of qualifying via the league are slim-to-none .
hamburg 's best bet is to win the europa cup outright .
but their desultory nil-nil draw in their home tie against fulham last week hardly put them in an ideal position to do that .
" labbadia is a dead issue , " a representative of the hamburg board declared tersely to reporters earlier on monday .
and it all started so well bildunterschrift : it 's been a painful 2010 for the northern german side this was supposed to be hamburg 's year .
after a few seasons of relative austerity , hofmann loosened the purse strings this summer , bringing in highly coveted young talents eljero elia and marcus berg , veteran midfielder ze roberto and labbadia , whose move from leverkusen is reported to have cost 1.3 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- .
many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .
hamburg were fourth over the winter break , and when hofmann brought in veteran star ruud van nistelrooy in january to bolster an injury-prone attack , many people considered the northern germans a dark-horse candidate for the title .
ca n't we all just get along ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero is just one player who 's lost his orientation but little , if anything , has gone right in 2010 for hamburg .
since the break , the team has managed only four wins in 15 matches , forgetting how to score goals in the process .
part of that was due to injuries .
ze roberto , and hamburg 's most reliable striker mladen petric , missed significant action this year , and elia , who looked like a winner , is out for the rest of the season .
but disciplinary problems and internal rancor have been equally , if not more , significant in hamburg 's tumble .
peruvian striker paolo guerrero went awol for weeks , claiming he was too afraid of flying to return from his home country , where he was recovering from a knee injury .
and when he did finally arrive in hamburg , he promptly got himself suspended for the rest of the season for throwing a water bottle at a fan - critics said it was the best aim he 'd displayed in months .

" we can not and did not want to continue in this formation , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told reporters after meeting with labbadia .
" we found we could n't expect to win against fulham .
it was the last point at which we could act so as not to endanger our season goal of qualifying for europe . "
but hamburg 's chances are already in grave danger .
in seventh place in the table , and five points behind sixth-placed stuttgart , hamburg 's prospects of qualifying via the league are slim-to-none .
hamburg 's best bet is to win the europa cup outright .
but their desultory nil-nil draw in their home tie against fulham last week hardly put them in an ideal position to do that .
" labbadia is a dead issue , " a representative of the hamburg board declared tersely to reporters earlier on monday .
and it all started so well bildunterschrift : it 's been a painful 2010 for the northern german side this was supposed to be hamburg 's year .
after a few seasons of relative austerity , hofmann loosened the purse strings this summer , bringing in highly coveted young talents eljero elia and marcus berg , veteran midfielder ze roberto and labbadia , whose move from leverkusen is reported to have cost 1.3 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- .
many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .
hamburg were fourth over the winter break , and when hofmann brought in veteran star ruud van nistelrooy in january to bolster an injury-prone attack , many people considered the northern germans a dark-horse candidate for the title .
ca n't we all just get along ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero is just one player who 's lost his orientation but little , if anything , has gone right in 2010 for hamburg .
since the break , the team has managed only four wins in 15 matches , forgetting how to score goals in the process .
part of that was due to injuries .
ze roberto , and hamburg 's most reliable striker mladen petric , missed significant action this year , and elia , who looked like a winner , is out for the rest of the season .
but disciplinary problems and internal rancor have been equally , if not more , significant in hamburg 's tumble .
peruvian striker paolo guerrero went awol for weeks , claiming he was too afraid of flying to return from his home country , where he was recovering from a knee injury .
and when he did finally arrive in hamburg , he promptly got himself suspended for the rest of the season for throwing a water bottle at a fan - critics said it was the best aim he 'd displayed in months .
moreover , both van nistelrooy and team captain and goalkeeper frank rost publicly criticized labbadia , with the dutch striker questioning the coach 's ability to communicate tactics .
technique coach ricardo moniz now takes over on an interim basis , as hamburg attempt to put the pieces back together .
his first assignment is in fulham on thursday .

however , according to guido steinberg , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , the upsurge in proceedings against islamist terror suspects is not only due to attacks on german soldiers in afghanistan that are prosecuted here in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 26.04.2010 serbian boy activist threatened with violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pocesta is a vocal pro-western advocate a twelve-year-old boy in serbia has begun receiving violent threats from ultranationalists for his outspoken pro-western views . in serbia , finding widespread public support for topics such as kosovo 's independence and nato membership is not exactly easy .
nationalism is still strong in the balkan state , and liberal pro-western advocates are in the minority .
but recently , that minority has been getting more attention - all because of a twelve-year-old boy named rastko pocesta .
as a young pro-western social activist , pocesta has gained fame through articles he 's published on blogs and facebook , which campaign for serbia to join the european union and nato .
he also supports the independence of kosovo , despite the serbian government 's stance that it is not a separate country .
" serbia should be a country in which human , civil , political and minority rights are maximally respected , " rastko said .
" it should be a country which is not seen through the wars in the 1990 's and the war crimes but by its involvement in international affairs . "
rastko added that serbian membership in the eu would bring economic stability and prosperty .
the young activist also believes nato membership would help improve the security of all serbs .
harsh feedback despite his young age , pocesta is not immune from violent threats made via the internet .
ultranationalists within serbia have begun to take notice of his work and say he 's betrayed serb values .
one post on the forum of a right-wing group known as obraz read ; " we should break this kid 's bones , and then his ideas . "
obraz considers any pro-western serb to be a traitor , since nato bombed the country during the kosovo war in the late 1990 's .
ultranationalists still have a strong presence in serbian society , as they regularly take part in street protests .
in 2008 , after the united states declared its support for kosovo 's independence , the american embassy in belgrade was set on fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultranationalist mladen obradovic opposes pocesta 's pro-western views pocesta has been given official protection , but says the threats will not stop him from doing his work .
" i 'll continue being a human rights activist and i 'll never step down , no matter what threats , " said pocesta .
" if i step down , it will be the failure of democracy in this country .
it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
mladen obradovic , the general secretary of obraz , did not think the violent threats on the group 's website were serious , but nevertheless does not approve of pocesta 's views .
" there is something wrong with this boy , " said obradovic .
" but i hope , since he 's still very young , that there is enough time for him to become a better pupil , a better serb , a better christian , a better person . "
political tug-of-war pocesta 's story reflects a larger political struggle within serbia , with one liberal side keen to move on from the past , and the other remaining fiercely nationalistic .
serbia 's pro-western government applied for eu membership at the end of last year .
the eu boosted serbia 's bid by unfreezing a free trade agreement with belgrade as well as allowing visa-free travel throughout the schengen zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu integration is not popular with all serbs however , kosovo 's declaration of independence in 2008 still remains an issue between the eu and serbia , as all but five eu members now recognize kosovo as an independent state .
pocesta does have at least one fan within serbia 's government , marko karadzic , the state secretary for human rights .
karadzic says he shares pocesta 's desire to eradicate the remnants of serbia 's violent past .
" you still have those violent groups and they simply do n't see themselves in a system where you have rules , " said karadzic .
" this is completely unacceptable because we have to show that we have learnt about the evil of war and violence and that we are going to fight against it . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultranationalist mladen obradovic opposes pocesta 's pro-western views pocesta has been given official protection , but says the threats will not stop him from doing his work .
" i 'll continue being a human rights activist and i 'll never step down , no matter what threats , " said pocesta .
" if i step down , it will be the failure of democracy in this country .
it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
mladen obradovic , the general secretary of obraz , did not think the violent threats on the group 's website were serious , but nevertheless does not approve of pocesta 's views .
" there is something wrong with this boy , " said obradovic .
" but i hope , since he 's still very young , that there is enough time for him to become a better pupil , a better serb , a better christian , a better person . "
political tug-of-war pocesta 's story reflects a larger political struggle within serbia , with one liberal side keen to move on from the past , and the other remaining fiercely nationalistic .
serbia 's pro-western government applied for eu membership at the end of last year .
the eu boosted serbia 's bid by unfreezing a free trade agreement with belgrade as well as allowing visa-free travel throughout the schengen zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu integration is not popular with all serbs however , kosovo 's declaration of independence in 2008 still remains an issue between the eu and serbia , as all but five eu members now recognize kosovo as an independent state .
pocesta does have at least one fan within serbia 's government , marko karadzic , the state secretary for human rights .
karadzic says he shares pocesta 's desire to eradicate the remnants of serbia 's violent past .
" you still have those violent groups and they simply do n't see themselves in a system where you have rules , " said karadzic .
" this is completely unacceptable because we have to show that we have learnt about the evil of war and violence and that we are going to fight against it . "

nationalism is still strong in the balkan state , and liberal pro-western advocates are in the minority .

he also supports the independence of kosovo , despite the serbian government 's stance that it is not a separate country .
" serbia should be a country in which human , civil , political and minority rights are maximally respected , " rastko said .

this was president karzai 's first visit to india after his re-election last year . during the talks manmohan singh and afghan president hamid karzai discussed a whole raft of issues impinging directly on peace and stability in afghanistan . backing " an afghan-led and afghan-owned " rebuilding of afghanistan , manmohan singh underlined india 's unwavering commitment to continuing reconstruction work in that country and said repeated attacks on indians would not deter his country from carrying on with this process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singh has asked karzai to protect the lives of indian citizens who are helping in afghanistan commitment to assist afghanistan prime minister singh said india remained committed to assisting afghanistan in its development efforts and said the development partnership was focused on areas of infrastructure development , human resource development and capacity building , food assistance and small development projects that bring immediate benefit to the people at the grass-roots level .
india has pledged $ 1.3 billion -lrb- almost one billion euros -rrb- for a slew of reconstruction and infrastructure projects in afghanistan .
but at the same time he sought an assurance that the security of indians in afghanistan would be treated with utmost priority considering the recent attacks on indian nationals . " on the issue of terrorism which threatens our region , president karzai assured me that the government of afghanistan will take all possible measures for the security of indians in afghanistan , " said singh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian embassy was the target of a suicide car bomb attack in kabul in oct , 2009 opposing external interference in the affairs of afghanistan , india cautioned president karzai against any power sharing deal with the taliban and urged a joint approach to combat the terrorism threatening the region .
common struggle against terrorism underlining the common struggle against terrorism and extremism karzai briefed manmohan singh on the peace jirga , an assembly of tribal elders , he plans to convene next month and the ongoing efforts to integrate those elements of the taliban which have no links with al qaeda or any terrorist network .
amitabh mattoo , an expert on south asia , was invited for the lunch reception hosted for karzai .
he said india conveyed its concerns on security and the fight against terrorism .
" obviously at the top of the agenda , the so-called reintegration process , the security situation in afghanistan and the need to build the capacity of the afghan national army and the police are on top for anyone who speaks about afghanistan , whether it is president karzai or otherwise , and given what has happened in the last few weeks , the sense of triumphalism within pakistan , that its position within afghanistan seems to be recognized by the west , i think given all this , india must have expressed concern . "
skepticism on taliban reintegration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai says he wants to reintegrate those members of the taliban who are not part of any terrorist network manmohan singh is reported to have conveyed india 's concerns over a plan , backed at the london conference in january , to reintegrate a section of the taliban in the afghan political mainstream . new delhi , which has always opposed any distinction between the so-called good taliban and bad taliban , fears such a move , pushed by the international coalition engaged in kabul , could lead to increased pakistani influence on the affairs of afghanistan and may jeopardize regional stability . karzai also requested manmohan singh to send representatives to the follow-up to the western-backed london conference in kabul later this year and invited him to visit afghanistan . the afghan president is en route to the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- summit in thimphu that begins on wednesday .

" the president 's life cut tragically short , and the death of poland 's patriotic elite , means one thing to us : we must complete their mission , " jaroslaw kaczynski said in a statement announcing his candidacy .
" we owe this to them ; we owe this to our nation , " he said .
jaroslaw , the elder twin by 45 minutes , heads the opposition right-wing law and justice party and served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 .
he lost that job to donald tusk of the civic platform , who is currently prime minister , in snap elections in november 2007 .
kaczynski said he 'd decided to campaign for the presidential job because poland was a shared responsibility that " demands overcoming personal suffering . "
public mood hard to predict in a recently published poll that had assumed jaroslaw kaczynski would run for president , he received about 26 percent support from those surveyed .
poland 's acting president , bronislaw komorowski , led the poll with nearly 50 percent support as the candidate for the governing , center-right civic platform .
but the public mood is difficult to gauge after the fatal plane accident , which wiped out much of poland 's military and political elite .
" this is not a normal election , " said krzysztof bobinski , director of the warsaw think-tank , unia and polska foundation .
" in reality , it wo n't be him -lrb- jaroslaw -rrb- running , it will be his brother .

" the president 's life cut tragically short , and the death of poland 's patriotic elite , means one thing to us : we must complete their mission , " jaroslaw kaczynski said in a statement announcing his candidacy .
" we owe this to them ; we owe this to our nation , " he said .
jaroslaw , the elder twin by 45 minutes , heads the opposition right-wing law and justice party and served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 .
he lost that job to donald tusk of the civic platform , who is currently prime minister , in snap elections in november 2007 .

lalit modi is accused of corruption and tax evasion .
he denies the allegations . just hours after the final match of ipl season three on sunday , the indian cricket authorities announced that lalit modi , the chairman and the commissioner of the ipl had been stripped of all his posts .
shashank manohar , the president of the board of control for cricket in india , which owns ipl , told media that the " suspension was necessary for a free and fair inquiry " .

corruption allegations modi , who has been a driving force behind the multi million dollar ipl tournament , is accused of a wide range of corruption allegations .
these include offering bribes , tax evasion , match fixing and irregularities in bidding deals related to the ipl .
according to local media , modi is also accused of receiving an 80 million dollar kickback when he negotiated television broadcast rights for the cricket series .
the ipl 's governing council has given lalit modi 15 days to explain why " disciplinary action should not be taken against him " .
the board also said that if modi 's reply was convincing , charges and proceedings against him would be dropped .
modi remains defiant 46-year-old modi has denied any wrong doing .
in a speech following the final match late last sunday , he insisted the " ipl was clean and transparent " .
" i reassure you that if there has been any flouting of the rules and regulations or if there have been any irregularities , i shall take full responsibility , " modi added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipl was established in 2008 the controversy started two weeks ago , when modi revealed the ownership details of a new franchise set to join the ipl in 2011 .

the news sparked media frenzy and protest from the opposition , which ultimately forced the minister to step down .

belgium 's center-right government collapsed on monday , four days after the prime minister tendered his resignation in a dispute between french and flemish speakers over language and political rights . belgium 's king albert ii has accepted the resignation of prime minister yves leterme 's coalition government amidst feuding between flemish and french speakers over the apportionment of a bilingual brussels electoral district .
it is the third time in as many years that leterme offered to step down when faced by intractable disputes .

belgium 's constitutional court ruled in 2003 that the so-called bhv district , the only bilingual constituency in the country , would have to be reapportioned .
since then , belgian leaders have remained at loggerheads over flemish demands to make parts of the district monolingual and francophone calls to allow voters throughout the district to support french-speaking political parties .

at a press conference on monday , lies hebbadj , an algerian-born 35 year-old butcher , responded to suggestions by french interior minister brice hortefeux that he should lose his french passport because he was believed to have four wives who had given him 12 children who were all receiving welfare benefits .
" as far as i know , it is not forbidden to have mistresses in france , nor is it forbidden under islam , " said hebbadj .
" if you lose your french nationality for having mistresses , then a lot of french men would have been stripped of their citizenship . "

at a press conference on monday , lies hebbadj , an algerian-born 35 year-old butcher , responded to suggestions by french interior minister brice hortefeux that he should lose his french passport because he was believed to have four wives who had given him 12 children who were all receiving welfare benefits .
" as far as i know , it is not forbidden to have mistresses in france , nor is it forbidden under islam , " said hebbadj .
" if you lose your french nationality for having mistresses , then a lot of french men would have been stripped of their citizenship . "
hebbadj became a french citizen in 1999 , after marrying a woman with french nationality .
hebbadj 's case received political and media attention after his wife was stopped and fined by police in nantes for driving while wearing a full-face veil , known as a " niqab " .
she was fined 22 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- on april 2 because police said the veil restricted her view and compromised her ability to drive safely .
she has so far refused to pay the fine .
unveiled controversy the political row over hebbadj comes as the french government is preparing legislation to ban the wearing of the full-face veil .
french president nicolas sarkozy has said that the veil is " not welcome " in france , calling it an affront to french values that denigrates women .
however , sarkozy 's critics say he is simply pandering to far-right voters after his party 's defeat in regional elections last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says full veils are not welcome in france french opinion polls show that 64 percent of the population either support a full ban on the niqab and burqa or approve of them at least being outlawed from state institutions .
the head of the french council of the muslim faith , mohamed moussaoui , said hebbadj 's case had been inflated by the media .
" if there was polygamy , the laws are clear on that and muslims in france are respectful of laws , " said moussaoui .
he added that , in contrast , a weekend gun attack on a mosque in southern france had received little attention .
a draft law for the ban on full-face veils is set to be presented to french ministers next month. mk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

members of the bishops ’ conference decided that more emphasis should be placed on victims . catholic bishops met in the german city of wuerzburg on monday to discuss draft guidelines on dealing with allegations of sexual abuse more effectively .
" we have reworked the guidelines and made them clearer and more precise , " said the conference representative on abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , referring to recently drafted rules .
the trier bishop said that he was optimistic the next meeting of the bishops ' conference could ratify the guidelines in june .
ackerman worked together with an expert group to draw up the new measures to protect children , which were received by bishops late last week .
he added that the church would not seek to protect priests who broke criminal laws . " it must be clear beyond doubt that we do not claim any legal status separate from civil law , " said ackermann .
victims ' point of view the revised guidelines are intended to address the issue more from the perspective of the victims .
there is also a greater emphasis on prevention of abuse .
ackerman said that the selection and qualification of commissioners who would be responsible for the issue of child abuse had also been addressed .

trading tiles for vegetation , green roofs promise both environmental and economic benefits . standing in the street , you probably would n't notice it . yet dusseldorf , the affluent capital of the western german state of north rhine westphalia , is home to more than 730,000 square meters of greenery above people 's heads . that 's roughly equivalent to 100 football fields spread over some 1,700 buildings and last year this feat won the city an award from the international green roof association -lrb- igra -rrb- . more than just a rooftop garden , a ' green roof ' is a different way of approaching architecture , using vegetation supported by waterproof materials instead of conventional construction materials . green roofs live longer green roofs have a number of benefits , including improved insulation and energy savings , but for some they also represent an aesthetic statement . " we wanted to make our car park more attractive , and at the time , replacing the facade and roof was imminent , " said ernst hagemann , the owner and operator of a green roofed multi-story car park in dusseldorf 's city center . although he admits that being a " nature-lover " influenced his decision when it came time to modernize in the 1980s , he says there were obvious practical benefits to covering his roof in earth and moss . back then , the city of dusseldorf subsidized 50 percent of the cost through a green roofing program .
while green roofs are more expensive to build than standard ones , hagemann saw economic savings in the long run .
" from the cost perspective , it was only marginally more expensive with the subsidy that we received from the city , " he said .
" if you consider that typical roofing felt needs to be repaired every five years or so and that after 12 or 15 years it needs to be completely replaced , then a green roof is definitely cheaper . "
the green roof on hagemann 's multi-story car park has not needed any repairs in the 25 years since it was installed .
this is because the layer of vegetation that has been planted over a waterproofing membrane protects the actual roof underneath it .
and there are other economic advantages too green roofs deliver savings through energy efficiency .
in the summer months , the roofs help save on air conditioning because of their cooling properties , and in winter they help save on heating because of their insulation .
bildunterschrift : green roofs have numerous benefits for the people who live underneath them services rendered they also offer a service to cities as a whole , helping moderate temperatures in the concrete jungle – a major reason why dusseldorf is backing green roof uptake , says katja holzmueller from the city 's environment department .
" the ability of green roofs to reduce thermal heating in cities is our primary motivation to promote green roofing , " she said .
" green roofs absorb rain water and so it evaporates more slowly … -lrb- they -rrb- therefore have a cooling effect . "
this cooling effect is especially interesting for areas that get hot in summer , because of cities ' tendency to trap heat , which can be deadly – especially for the elderly – during heat waves .
the roofs also provide an opportunity for flora and fauna to find room to survive in cities .
according to the berlin-based igra , green roofs especially promote biodiversity , providing shelter and food for bees , butterflies and beetles .
car park owner ernst hagemann is pleased with the little creatures his green roof has attracted , despite its location just off a busy dusseldorf street .
" there are many insects and birds here that were long gone from the city .
i 've seen a wren , chaffinches , greenfinches – all kinds of birds , " he said .
the benefits of green roofs do n't stop here though , according to igra .
they can also enhance the quality of life for city slickers by reducing noise levels , and can reduce flooding and damage to sewer systems because they reduce water run-off by 50-90 percent during storms .
productivity gains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green roofs offer employees a place to a take a break green roofs are also catching on in the corporate world a means of improving productivity .
" it 's very important that employees have green areas where they can take a break … important studies about this have been conducted in germany , " said christian schulze-ardey from the bonn-based landscape research , development & construction society , which publishes technical guidelines for green roofs and buildings .
" for example , bmw put a lot of green structure in its offices and the result was a very low rate of illness .

trading tiles for vegetation , green roofs promise both environmental and economic benefits . standing in the street , you probably would n't notice it . yet dusseldorf , the affluent capital of the western german state of north rhine westphalia , is home to more than 730,000 square meters of greenery above people 's heads . that 's roughly equivalent to 100 football fields spread over some 1,700 buildings and last year this feat won the city an award from the international green roof association -lrb- igra -rrb- . more than just a rooftop garden , a ' green roof ' is a different way of approaching architecture , using vegetation supported by waterproof materials instead of conventional construction materials . green roofs live longer green roofs have a number of benefits , including improved insulation and energy savings , but for some they also represent an aesthetic statement . " we wanted to make our car park more attractive , and at the time , replacing the facade and roof was imminent , " said ernst hagemann , the owner and operator of a green roofed multi-story car park in dusseldorf 's city center . although he admits that being a " nature-lover " influenced his decision when it came time to modernize in the 1980s , he says there were obvious practical benefits to covering his roof in earth and moss . back then , the city of dusseldorf subsidized 50 percent of the cost through a green roofing program .
while green roofs are more expensive to build than standard ones , hagemann saw economic savings in the long run .
" from the cost perspective , it was only marginally more expensive with the subsidy that we received from the city , " he said .
" if you consider that typical roofing felt needs to be repaired every five years or so and that after 12 or 15 years it needs to be completely replaced , then a green roof is definitely cheaper . "
the green roof on hagemann 's multi-story car park has not needed any repairs in the 25 years since it was installed .
this is because the layer of vegetation that has been planted over a waterproofing membrane protects the actual roof underneath it .
and there are other economic advantages too green roofs deliver savings through energy efficiency .
in the summer months , the roofs help save on air conditioning because of their cooling properties , and in winter they help save on heating because of their insulation .
bildunterschrift : green roofs have numerous benefits for the people who live underneath them services rendered they also offer a service to cities as a whole , helping moderate temperatures in the concrete jungle – a major reason why dusseldorf is backing green roof uptake , says katja holzmueller from the city 's environment department .
" the ability of green roofs to reduce thermal heating in cities is our primary motivation to promote green roofing , " she said .
" green roofs absorb rain water and so it evaporates more slowly … -lrb- they -rrb- therefore have a cooling effect . "
this cooling effect is especially interesting for areas that get hot in summer , because of cities ' tendency to trap heat , which can be deadly – especially for the elderly – during heat waves .
the roofs also provide an opportunity for flora and fauna to find room to survive in cities .
according to the berlin-based igra , green roofs especially promote biodiversity , providing shelter and food for bees , butterflies and beetles .
car park owner ernst hagemann is pleased with the little creatures his green roof has attracted , despite its location just off a busy dusseldorf street .
" there are many insects and birds here that were long gone from the city .
i 've seen a wren , chaffinches , greenfinches – all kinds of birds , " he said .
the benefits of green roofs do n't stop here though , according to igra .
they can also enhance the quality of life for city slickers by reducing noise levels , and can reduce flooding and damage to sewer systems because they reduce water run-off by 50-90 percent during storms .
productivity gains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green roofs offer employees a place to a take a break green roofs are also catching on in the corporate world a means of improving productivity .
" it 's very important that employees have green areas where they can take a break … important studies about this have been conducted in germany , " said christian schulze-ardey from the bonn-based landscape research , development & construction society , which publishes technical guidelines for green roofs and buildings .
" for example , bmw put a lot of green structure in its offices and the result was a very low rate of illness .
i think that 's a sign of the importance of green structures and green roofing , " he said .
schulze-ardey also believes german expertise in green roofing is highly prized overseas , because of the country 's decades-long experience in engineering the structures . " we often have demand from people in america to buy our guidelines , " he said , adding that green roofs had an even more important role to play in the us where cities are much large than in germany .
in the meantime , green roof leader dusseldorf is n't resting on its laurels .
the city introduced a new incentive this year – a reduced sewage charge for buildings with green roofs .
the city is also conducting research to see just how much of an impact green roofs have in curbing temperatures and cutting run-off . author : laura schweiger editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many end up going to china , thinking business is much easier there .
but the rules that apply are different than those in the west and they are consistent , according to a man who has been doing business for 25 years in the people 's republic .
due to high production costs , manfred grundt of naimextraiders , a german company that produces natural sausage casing , moved his production facilities to china over 20 years ago .
there , he employs over 800 people who work to produce the casing of germany 's national food , the bratwurst .

in china it is only 595 euros -lrb- 800 dollars -rrb- , and this is still considered a well-paid job in china .

these principles do n't only apply to western entrepreneurs .
the same goes for politicians .
they have also had to go through the same difficult learning process .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred grundt 's firm produces sausage casing in china self experience the numbers speak loudly and clearly ; if manfred grundt were to still produce his sausage casing in germany , he would have to pay a monthly average of 4,500 euros -lrb- 6,000 dollars -rrb- for each employee .
in china it is only 595 euros -lrb- 800 dollars -rrb- , and this is still considered a well-paid job in china .
what started out as a small project in the 1970s became a joint venture in 1986 .
and back then , neither germany nor the european community offered diplomatic nor financial support .
manfred grundt was a pioneer in his field .
and nobody knows better than him what it takes to do business in china .
" those who have patience , and who invest time and create friendships are the ones who are successful , " says the german business man .
" one thing is for sure in the people 's republic of china : the chinese are proud business people . "
when in china ...
when doing business it is also important not to " lose face " , neither your own , nor cause someone else to " lose " theirs .
this is one very important custom in the land of the dragon .
and only people who truly respect the customs of the chinese partners ' culture will really be able to make money .
aside from being extremely polite , eating out with business partners is also very important .
" those who fail to establish a network of business contacts will not be successful in china , " grundt warns .
" i am not talking about bribery , but simply about meetings with food and drinks .
to this day we meet with the veterinary authority each quarter and with customs because we have known each other for so long .
some of the veterinarians from back then are ministers in beijing now . "
bildunterschrift : the shanghai skyline : the symbol of wealth and business long road to success but it is a long and sometimes difficult road to this kind of success .
networking , trust and friendships take time .
you need a great amount of patience , a foreign concept for most german companies .
manfred grundt tells medium-sized business owners : " if you take the bureaucratic road , do n't expect to get anything done in less than two years .
whoever thinks they will be making great business deals in china in less than two years is going to lose . "
these principles do n't only apply to western entrepreneurs .
the same goes for politicians .
they have also had to go through the same difficult learning process .
grundt thinks they have started taking the right approach in the last five years .
had grundt not learned this lesson over 20 years ago , he says he probably would n't be where he is today .
he also says at least 80 percent of companies in his branch would n't exist today if it were n't for china .

as he takes a group through the security checkpoint , he points to fresh cut flowers which have been left near the gates . " that was put there for the anniversary .
people who used to live here , they come here .
they are the veterans of chernobyl . " a dead city the city of pripyat lies just two kilometers from the chernobyl plant .
it was a model city , created to house chernobyl employees and their families .
these days , it is a ghost town .
wire , debris and old furniture litter the darkened hallways of the deserted soviet apartment blocks . but despite continued looting , zabarin says it is too dangerous to knock the buildings down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pripyat was completely abandoned following the explosion " if they explode buildings , a radiation cloud will spread all over europe .
even to canada and the united states .
now we are waiting .
all these buildings will fall down in ten or fifteen years .
one school already collapsed . " the road out of pripyat is dotted with dilapidated cottages which are sinking into their own foundations .
they are masked from the road by a tangle of wild shrubs and tree branches . 116,000 people were evacuated from this region . far-reaching effects today , it is unclear if the evacuations were necessary .
uprooted communities have suffered severe social problems . when the reactor exploded , the soviet government , which controlled ukraine at the time , failed to notify the people who lived here .
for days , people went about their lives completely unaware that they were being exposed to radiation . according to pavlo zamostyan of the united nations development program , this had serious social and psychological consequences for chernobyl-affected communities . " fears and uncertainty created in the first months and years , when the soviet government failed to tell the truth about the scale of the accident , created a specific psychological trauma in the affected population .
a so-called ' victim syndrome . " ' radiation exposure led to an increase in cancer and widespread birth defects .
but zamostyan says the most toxic element in chernobyl-affected communities now , is a deep-rooted pessimism which has prevented survivors from moving forward with their lives . overcoming chernobyl the stigma of chernobyl has convinced many survivors that they are sick and incapable – and zamostyan says the government compensation program is making the problem worse . " we have to combat the paternalistic system , which is fine for an emergency situation , when ... a strong centralised system of actions is needed - military type operations , evacuation , resettlement .
but for longtime recovery , it ’ s not acceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosion threw up a cloud of radioactive dust as part of its effort to combat the psychological and social effects of the chernobyl incident , the undp is supporting the borodianka center of psycho-social rehabilitation . sasha starovoitenko is a radiation educator with the center .
he was a liquidator who was deployed to the exclusion zone after chernobyl exploded .
his crew carried appliances and furniture out of the deserted apartments and dumped them in 100 meter deep pits , where they remain buried to this day . he remembers standing on a bridge near pripyat after the evacuation . " barbed wire .
empty houses .
it felt like being in outer space .
no one is there .
i remember big black dogs .
what were they doing there ?
what were they eating ? " thousands of survivors were resettled in the region of borodianka , which is where starovoitenko lives .
but he says even those who didn ’ t get sick were marked by the experience . " they had no work .
poor health and no money to improve their health .
so , they started drinking vodka , as if that would help , " says starovoitenko .
he was told by a doctor that drinking vodka would help stimulate his circulation and make the radiation " fly away . " " so we were drinking .
even driving drunk .
i got so drunk i almost lost my family , " he explains . starovoitenko decided he wanted to change things .
with the support of the borodianka center of psycho-social rehabilitation , he started a chapter of alcoholics anonymous .
he now works at the center , offering radiation education programs for people in chernobyl-affected communities . international help this is the kind of change the pavlo zamostyan from the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- says he wants to see : chernobyl survivors becoming advocates for change in their own lives . the undp is challenging chernobyl-affected communities to move away from government compensation and to dream up plans for businesses and social enterprises .
if they can raise half the money themselves , the undp will step in with the rest .
zamostyan says this helps break the cycle of dependence which has paralyzed chernobyl survivors . " at that moment , people change psychology , attitude towards life .
they understand that in order to have something in village you don ’ t have to wait for government – you can initiate .
the psychological part is more important - people see they have power and everything depends on their wish and willingness to live normally . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 26.04.2010 a german recipe revolutionizing the brazilian beer market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewing techniques are changing the brazilian market germany 's economics minister is in brazil to build business ties ahead of the 2014 world cup and 2016 olympics , but a mutual love of something very german is already connecting the countries : beer . german economics minister rainer bruederle has arrived in brazil at the beginning of a five-day trip to south america 's largest country .
his goal is to get a foot in the door for german business ahead of the 2014 football world cup and 2016 olympics to be hosted by the emerging economic powerhouse .
but it is not only a mutual love of football that bruederle will be using to bridge the divide between the two countries .
brazilians have also taken to heart , and stomach , the german art of brewing beer .
the setting is a modestly sized city called blumenau , which most would assume lies somewhere near the black forest or perhaps along one of germany 's many rivers .
however this city can not be found in germany , or anywhere on the european continent .
it lies in the south of brazil and has become home to what it claims is the world 's second-largest beer festival after oktoberfest in munich .
the city was founded by germans around 160 years ago and is now home to hundreds of thousands of their descendents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenau is a home away from home for germans the city hosts a collection of small breweries that have carried on the world-renowned tradition of german beer-making under the labels " eisenbahn , " " schornstein , " and simply " das bier . "
lasting legacy master brewer claudio jose gonzales de matos says brazilians have taken up beer making and drinking with as much passion as the germans who brought their special recipes to the country so long ago .
" we live here in a tropical country and year after year , beer consumption has continued to rise substantially .
in particular , small breweries here in brazil are growing very fast , " he says .
" they have revived the traditional brewing techniques and distanced themselves from the more modern industrial-style methods .
today , there are many small breweries in brazil producing beer of high quality . "
every year , brazilians consume around 10 billion liters of beer - just one billion short of germans - and the south american country now represents the fourth-largest beer market in the world .
mass produced , mainstream beer labels still dominate in brazil , but small breweries are staging a comeback , and have trebled their market share to six percent in recent years .
bildunterschrift : brazilians are warming to beer culture solid foundation brewer pedro paulo moretzohn , who spent many years perfecting his brewing techniques in europe , believes that german beer-making methods are underpinning the fight back of micro-breweries in brazil .
" these new enterprises sprang mainly from german culture in cities like blumenau and others nearby , " he says .
" but also because people want beers with a variety of tastes .
here our beers are virtually without additives - nothing other than grain varieties such as malt , hops and wheat .
that gives these beers a very special characteristic . "
behind the boom are more than 100 micro-breweries producing " cervejas artesanais , " or hand-crafted beers , with varieties including yeast beers , dark beers and even koelsch-style beers popular in the areas surrounding the western german city of cologne .
despite the quality beer offered by micro-breweries , a mass-produced , light , watery version of a pilsner still dominates the brazilian market .
but brewing instructor ligia marcondes believes the market for high-quality beer is continuously growing in the country of nearly 190 million , especially among the middle class .

i like full-bodied beers .

so you could say i have changed my consumption habits a little . "
raising the bar so successful have some micro-breweries been that they 've forced some larger brazilian breweries to rethink their beer-making ethos , leading to an improvement in the quality of some mass-produced labels .
brewing specialist cilene saorin says what is needed is a shift in paradigm by both beer makers and consumers .
" we need to work on our drinking culture and improve knowledge of beer culture , " she says .
" we have to explain that pilsner is not the only beer , but that there are over 100 different varieties and that different beers suit different occasions .
this process of education will take time " .

his goal is to get a foot in the door for german business ahead of the 2014 football world cup and 2016 olympics to be hosted by the emerging economic powerhouse .
but it is not only a mutual love of football that bruederle will be using to bridge the divide between the two countries .
brazilians have also taken to heart , and stomach , the german art of brewing beer .
the setting is a modestly sized city called blumenau , which most would assume lies somewhere near the black forest or perhaps along one of germany 's many rivers .
however this city can not be found in germany , or anywhere on the european continent .
it lies in the south of brazil and has become home to what it claims is the world 's second-largest beer festival after oktoberfest in munich .
the city was founded by germans around 160 years ago and is now home to hundreds of thousands of their descendents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenau is a home away from home for germans the city hosts a collection of small breweries that have carried on the world-renowned tradition of german beer-making under the labels " eisenbahn , " " schornstein , " and simply " das bier .

despite the quality beer offered by micro-breweries , a mass-produced , light , watery version of a pilsner still dominates the brazilian market .
but brewing instructor ligia marcondes believes the market for high-quality beer is continuously growing in the country of nearly 190 million , especially among the middle class .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still enjoy their beer more than brazilians " for example , today i can say that i love hoppy beers , whereas earlier , i might have thought those beers were too bitter , " she says .
" at the moment i like wheat beer , but of course , i 'll still try new beers .
i like full-bodied beers .
bitter beers , too .
so you could say i have changed my consumption habits a little . "
raising the bar so successful have some micro-breweries been that they 've forced some larger brazilian breweries to rethink their beer-making ethos , leading to an improvement in the quality of some mass-produced labels .
brewing specialist cilene saorin says what is needed is a shift in paradigm by both beer makers and consumers .
" we need to work on our drinking culture and improve knowledge of beer culture , " she says .
" we have to explain that pilsner is not the only beer , but that there are over 100 different varieties and that different beers suit different occasions .
this process of education will take time " .
" we 've already made a lot of progress over the last five years .
give us another five years and you 'll see that the market will have evolved . "

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .

however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.04.2010 cult clubs kaiserslautern and st. pauli are set for bundesliga return großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lautern fans gathered to watch the augsburg match that ensured their promotion the bundesliga will see the return of a familiar name next season , as former champions kaiserslautern get promoted .
and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .
back in black bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli fans are a colorful , fun-loving bunch if lautern are one of the bundesliga 's most storied teams , st. pauli are without doubt the hippest .
the club has only spent a total of five years in the first division and its greatest success was beating the then world club champions bayern munich , but results are not the source of its appeal .
the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .
back in black bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli fans are a colorful , fun-loving bunch if lautern are one of the bundesliga 's most storied teams , st. pauli are without doubt the hippest .
the club has only spent a total of five years in the first division and its greatest success was beating the then world club champions bayern munich , but results are not the source of its appeal .
the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .

st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

many questions are being asked by politicians , the airlines and scientists about a phenomenon that could occur at any time and , according to past trends , could be even more severe .
airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by volcanoes .
jet engines can suck in volcanic ash , which melts in the intense heat . the turbine blades are then coated and can clog up and fail .
it has the makings of a potential catastrophe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1.2 million passengers per day were affected so when the huge cloud of ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano drifted into british airspace , the uk 's air industry regulator banned all commercial flights .
more than a dozen other countries - including germany and france - followed that example , closing their airspace either partially or fully .
" volcanic ash and jet engines do n't mix , so safety is our number one priority , " said bob jones , the uk regulator 's head of operations .
" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .
" where you have a small chance of that happening , it would be very wrong to say , let 's give it a try .
this is a matter of life and death . "
but as the flight ban dragged on , it quickly became more a matter of life and death for the airlines , which were losing about 150 million euros a day .
some were in danger of going under financially and they began to complain that the authorities had overreacted . incomplete analysis british weather forecasters used a computer program to predict where the wind would carry the ash cloud and how quickly it would disperse .
the program was first developed after the nuclear reactor accident at chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you balance economic fallout for airlines against passenger safety ?
britain 's met office says it is tried and tested .
but giovanni bisignani , head of the international air transport association , is angry that a great swathe of northern european airspace was closed purely on the basis of computer modeling .
" i call it a european mess because we did not focus on figures and facts .
europe was using a theoretical , mathematical approach .
that is not what we need , " he said .
" we need test flights to go into the atmosphere , assess the ashes and then take decisions . " in fact , it has emerged that the met office could not establish a complete picture of the cloud over britain until almost a week into the crisis because its specialist monitoring jet was out of action .
the bae 146 was the only plane equipped with state-of-the-art measuring instruments that could map the full extent of the ash .
yet by the fourth day of the shutdown , european airlines like lufthansa , klm and british airways had flown a number of their own test flights . they all reported no damage to their jet engines . peter sammonds , a volcanologist at university college , london , said this underlines the fact that it is not enough to rely solely on weather simulations . " that sort of initial monitoring of the volcano , the modeling by the met office , probably needs to be backed up with more intensive atmospheric sampling to try and map the distribution of the ash in the atmosphere somewhat more accurately to provide better input into what the next decision should be , " he said . low concentration test flights by research aircraft revealed interesting data .
the ash cloud contained basalt , not the more damaging substance andesite .
the ash concentration was also extremely low - no more than 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air .
jet engine manufacturers said the cloud would need to be about 20 times denser to damage turbine blades .
after six days , all european airspace was officially judged to be safe and all remaining flight restrictions were lifted .
it is estimated that the airlines lost more than a billion euros due to the shutdown .
european air traffic authorities admit they have been on a steep learning curve and now have a more flexible approach to volcanic ash .
just a preview just as well , according to iceland 's president olafur grimsson . more ash could be on the way - much more , in fact , when iceland 's giant katla volcano erupts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines have been vocal in their criticism of the blanket airspace closure " what we have seen now is in fact a small rehearsal of what would happen when katla will erupt , " he said .
" so i think it is high time for european governments and airline authorities all over europe and the world to start planning for it . "
katla erupts roughly once every one hundred years and the last time it lost its top was in 1918 .
siim kallas , the eu 's transport commissioner , has said he will begin working this week with colleagues to lay out a road map for similar events .
the list of questions he faces is daunting , ranging from determining the safety threshold for different engines , weighing potential danger against economic fallout and balancing passenger rights against the industry 's health .
" we needed a fast , coordinated european response to a crisis , " he told reporters .
" instead , we had a fragmented patchwork of 27 national airspaces .
we need a single european regulator for a single european sky . "
kallas has said he will propose speeding up the plan to unify control over all european skyways .

now , after only nine months , he 's been given the pink slip , as the club tries to salvage its season .
but there 's little left to salvage . hamburg 's board of directors announced labbadia would be leaving the club involuntarily on monday , one day after the team suffered a disastrous 5-1 loss to hoffenheim in the bundesliga and three days before a crucial away tie to fulham in the europa league semi-finals .
" we can not and did not want to continue in this formation , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told reporters after meeting with labbadia .
" we found we could n't expect to win against fulham .
it was the last point at which we could act so as not to endanger our season goal of qualifying for europe . "
but hamburg 's chances are already in grave danger .
in seventh place in the table , and five points behind sixth-placed stuttgart , hamburg 's prospects of qualifying via the league are slim-to-none .
hamburg 's best bet is to win the europa cup outright .
but their desultory nil-nil draw in their home tie against fulham last week hardly put them in an ideal position to do that .
" labbadia is a dead issue , " a representative of the hamburg board declared tersely to reporters earlier on monday .
and it all started so well bildunterschrift : it 's been a painful 2010 for the northern german side this was supposed to be hamburg 's year .
after a few seasons of relative austerity , hofmann loosened the purse strings this summer , bringing in highly coveted young talents eljero elia and marcus berg , veteran midfielder ze roberto and labbadia , whose move from leverkusen is reported to have cost 1.3 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- .
many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .
hamburg were fourth over the winter break , and when hofmann brought in veteran star ruud van nistelrooy in january to bolster an injury-prone attack , many people considered the northern germans a dark-horse candidate for the title .
ca n't we all just get along ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero is just one player who 's lost his orientation but little , if anything , has gone right in 2010 for hamburg .
since the break , the team has managed only four wins in 15 matches , forgetting how to score goals in the process .
part of that was due to injuries .
ze roberto , and hamburg 's most reliable striker mladen petric , missed significant action this year , and elia , who looked like a winner , is out for the rest of the season .
but disciplinary problems and internal rancor have been equally , if not more , significant in hamburg 's tumble .
peruvian striker paolo guerrero went awol for weeks , claiming he was too afraid of flying to return from his home country , where he was recovering from a knee injury .
and when he did finally arrive in hamburg , he promptly got himself suspended for the rest of the season for throwing a water bottle at a fan - critics said it was the best aim he 'd displayed in months .
moreover , both van nistelrooy and team captain and goalkeeper frank rost publicly criticized labbadia , with the dutch striker questioning the coach 's ability to communicate tactics .
technique coach ricardo moniz now takes over on an interim basis , as hamburg attempt to put the pieces back together .
his first assignment is in fulham on thursday .

many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .
hamburg were fourth over the winter break , and when hofmann brought in veteran star ruud van nistelrooy in january to bolster an injury-prone attack , many people considered the northern germans a dark-horse candidate for the title .
ca n't we all just get along ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero is just one player who 's lost his orientation but little , if anything , has gone right in 2010 for hamburg .
since the break , the team has managed only four wins in 15 matches , forgetting how to score goals in the process .
part of that was due to injuries .
ze roberto , and hamburg 's most reliable striker mladen petric , missed significant action this year , and elia , who looked like a winner , is out for the rest of the season .
but disciplinary problems and internal rancor have been equally , if not more , significant in hamburg 's tumble .
peruvian striker paolo guerrero went awol for weeks , claiming he was too afraid of flying to return from his home country , where he was recovering from a knee injury .
and when he did finally arrive in hamburg , he promptly got himself suspended for the rest of the season for throwing a water bottle at a fan - critics said it was the best aim he 'd displayed in months .
moreover , both van nistelrooy and team captain and goalkeeper frank rost publicly criticized labbadia , with the dutch striker questioning the coach 's ability to communicate tactics .
technique coach ricardo moniz now takes over on an interim basis , as hamburg attempt to put the pieces back together .
his first assignment is in fulham on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 26.04.2010 germans probe more islamists than ever before , federal agency says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg zierke heads the agency that investigates attacks that affect germany as a nation germany has noted a rise in the number of preliminary proceedings against islamist terror suspects .
the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- says they amount to a record 350 cases - the highest number yet . of the 350 preliminary investigations into suspected islamist terrorists , 220 inquiries are currently being handled by germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , and " almost half of those are aimed at finding the perpetrators of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , " bka chief joerg ziercke said . under german law , attacks on german nationals anywhere are a crime and must be investigated if a complaint is made .
however , according to guido steinberg , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , the upsurge in proceedings against islamist terror suspects is not only due to attacks on german soldiers in afghanistan that are prosecuted here in germany .
" a kind of german jihadist scene has emerged since 2006 , and that is also why the number of people under scrutiny has risen , " steinberg told deutsche welle .
" associates of islamic terrorism " the bka considers about 1,100 people in germany to be part of an " islamist terrorist personnel potential . "
" nationwide , security forces have an eye on 127 potentially threatening individuals , " ziercke told the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are increasingly targeted by taliban insurgents since the beginning of last year , there has been an increase in the number of germans travelling to islamist training camps , zierke said .
" more than 30 young germans went to afghanistan or pakistan in 2009 . "
" there 's a german community in the area now .
a group of 10-12 people is trying to lure others with german-language propaganda , " he said .
" unfortunately , they are successful . "
a kind of pipeline the germans in pakistani islamic training camps were showing their countrymen how to get terrorist training there , guido steinberg said .
" they serve as a kind of role model . "
steinberg said there was speculation about whether german nationals were participating in attacks on german soldiers in afghanistan .
" some germans have joined the islamic movement of uzbekistan , which is taking part in attacks on german soldiers , but there is no evidence that germans take part in these attacks , " he said .
" but that might happen at any time since , obviously , there is an interest on their part to fight german soldiers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 26.04.2010 serbian boy activist threatened with violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pocesta is a vocal pro-western advocate a twelve-year-old boy in serbia has begun receiving violent threats from ultranationalists for his outspoken pro-western views . in serbia , finding widespread public support for topics such as kosovo 's independence and nato membership is not exactly easy .
nationalism is still strong in the balkan state , and liberal pro-western advocates are in the minority .
but recently , that minority has been getting more attention - all because of a twelve-year-old boy named rastko pocesta .
as a young pro-western social activist , pocesta has gained fame through articles he 's published on blogs and facebook , which campaign for serbia to join the european union and nato .
he also supports the independence of kosovo , despite the serbian government 's stance that it is not a separate country .
" serbia should be a country in which human , civil , political and minority rights are maximally respected , " rastko said .
" it should be a country which is not seen through the wars in the 1990 's and the war crimes but by its involvement in international affairs . "
rastko added that serbian membership in the eu would bring economic stability and prosperty .
the young activist also believes nato membership would help improve the security of all serbs .
harsh feedback despite his young age , pocesta is not immune from violent threats made via the internet .
ultranationalists within serbia have begun to take notice of his work and say he 's betrayed serb values .
one post on the forum of a right-wing group known as obraz read ; " we should break this kid 's bones , and then his ideas . "
obraz considers any pro-western serb to be a traitor , since nato bombed the country during the kosovo war in the late 1990 's .
ultranationalists still have a strong presence in serbian society , as they regularly take part in street protests .
in 2008 , after the united states declared its support for kosovo 's independence , the american embassy in belgrade was set on fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultranationalist mladen obradovic opposes pocesta 's pro-western views pocesta has been given official protection , but says the threats will not stop him from doing his work .
" i 'll continue being a human rights activist and i 'll never step down , no matter what threats , " said pocesta .
" if i step down , it will be the failure of democracy in this country .
it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
mladen obradovic , the general secretary of obraz , did not think the violent threats on the group 's website were serious , but nevertheless does not approve of pocesta 's views .
" there is something wrong with this boy , " said obradovic .
" but i hope , since he 's still very young , that there is enough time for him to become a better pupil , a better serb , a better christian , a better person . "
political tug-of-war pocesta 's story reflects a larger political struggle within serbia , with one liberal side keen to move on from the past , and the other remaining fiercely nationalistic .
serbia 's pro-western government applied for eu membership at the end of last year .
the eu boosted serbia 's bid by unfreezing a free trade agreement with belgrade as well as allowing visa-free travel throughout the schengen zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu integration is not popular with all serbs however , kosovo 's declaration of independence in 2008 still remains an issue between the eu and serbia , as all but five eu members now recognize kosovo as an independent state .
pocesta does have at least one fan within serbia 's government , marko karadzic , the state secretary for human rights .
karadzic says he shares pocesta 's desire to eradicate the remnants of serbia 's violent past .
" you still have those violent groups and they simply do n't see themselves in a system where you have rules , " said karadzic .
" this is completely unacceptable because we have to show that we have learnt about the evil of war and violence and that we are going to fight against it . "

dw-world.de kosovo says independence is ' irreversible ' the international court of justice has begun hearings on the legality of kosovo 's secession from serbia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 26.04.2010 serbian boy activist threatened with violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pocesta is a vocal pro-western advocate a twelve-year-old boy in serbia has begun receiving violent threats from ultranationalists for his outspoken pro-western views . in serbia , finding widespread public support for topics such as kosovo 's independence and nato membership is not exactly easy .
nationalism is still strong in the balkan state , and liberal pro-western advocates are in the minority .
but recently , that minority has been getting more attention - all because of a twelve-year-old boy named rastko pocesta .
as a young pro-western social activist , pocesta has gained fame through articles he 's published on blogs and facebook , which campaign for serbia to join the european union and nato .
he also supports the independence of kosovo , despite the serbian government 's stance that it is not a separate country .
" serbia should be a country in which human , civil , political and minority rights are maximally respected , " rastko said .
" it should be a country which is not seen through the wars in the 1990 's and the war crimes but by its involvement in international affairs . "
rastko added that serbian membership in the eu would bring economic stability and prosperty .
the young activist also believes nato membership would help improve the security of all serbs .
harsh feedback despite his young age , pocesta is not immune from violent threats made via the internet .
ultranationalists within serbia have begun to take notice of his work and say he 's betrayed serb values .
one post on the forum of a right-wing group known as obraz read ; " we should break this kid 's bones , and then his ideas . "
obraz considers any pro-western serb to be a traitor , since nato bombed the country during the kosovo war in the late 1990 's .
ultranationalists still have a strong presence in serbian society , as they regularly take part in street protests .
in 2008 , after the united states declared its support for kosovo 's independence , the american embassy in belgrade was set on fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultranationalist mladen obradovic opposes pocesta 's pro-western views pocesta has been given official protection , but says the threats will not stop him from doing his work .
" i 'll continue being a human rights activist and i 'll never step down , no matter what threats , " said pocesta .
" if i step down , it will be the failure of democracy in this country .
it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
mladen obradovic , the general secretary of obraz , did not think the violent threats on the group 's website were serious , but nevertheless does not approve of pocesta 's views .
" there is something wrong with this boy , " said obradovic .
" but i hope , since he 's still very young , that there is enough time for him to become a better pupil , a better serb , a better christian , a better person . "
political tug-of-war pocesta 's story reflects a larger political struggle within serbia , with one liberal side keen to move on from the past , and the other remaining fiercely nationalistic .
serbia 's pro-western government applied for eu membership at the end of last year .
the eu boosted serbia 's bid by unfreezing a free trade agreement with belgrade as well as allowing visa-free travel throughout the schengen zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu integration is not popular with all serbs however , kosovo 's declaration of independence in 2008 still remains an issue between the eu and serbia , as all but five eu members now recognize kosovo as an independent state .
pocesta does have at least one fan within serbia 's government , marko karadzic , the state secretary for human rights .
karadzic says he shares pocesta 's desire to eradicate the remnants of serbia 's violent past .
" you still have those violent groups and they simply do n't see themselves in a system where you have rules , " said karadzic .
" this is completely unacceptable because we have to show that we have learnt about the evil of war and violence and that we are going to fight against it . "

this was president karzai 's first visit to india after his re-election last year . during the talks manmohan singh and afghan president hamid karzai discussed a whole raft of issues impinging directly on peace and stability in afghanistan . backing " an afghan-led and afghan-owned " rebuilding of afghanistan , manmohan singh underlined india 's unwavering commitment to continuing reconstruction work in that country and said repeated attacks on indians would not deter his country from carrying on with this process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singh has asked karzai to protect the lives of indian citizens who are helping in afghanistan commitment to assist afghanistan prime minister singh said india remained committed to assisting afghanistan in its development efforts and said the development partnership was focused on areas of infrastructure development , human resource development and capacity building , food assistance and small development projects that bring immediate benefit to the people at the grass-roots level .

" obviously at the top of the agenda , the so-called reintegration process , the security situation in afghanistan and the need to build the capacity of the afghan national army and the police are on top for anyone who speaks about afghanistan , whether it is president karzai or otherwise , and given what has happened in the last few weeks , the sense of triumphalism within pakistan , that its position within afghanistan seems to be recognized by the west , i think given all this , india must have expressed concern .

" the president 's life cut tragically short , and the death of poland 's patriotic elite , means one thing to us : we must complete their mission , " jaroslaw kaczynski said in a statement announcing his candidacy .
" we owe this to them ; we owe this to our nation , " he said .
jaroslaw , the elder twin by 45 minutes , heads the opposition right-wing law and justice party and served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 .
he lost that job to donald tusk of the civic platform , who is currently prime minister , in snap elections in november 2007 .

but the public mood is difficult to gauge after the fatal plane accident , which wiped out much of poland 's military and political elite .
" this is not a normal election , " said krzysztof bobinski , director of the warsaw think-tank , unia and polska foundation .
" in reality , it wo n't be him -lrb- jaroslaw -rrb- running , it will be his brother .
his campaign will play on sympathy for his brother . "
all political parties had until this monday to notify the national election commission of their respective candidates .
each candidate must now gather 100,000 signatures of support by may 6 .
under the polish constitution , the date for presidential elections must be announced within two weeks of a sitting president 's death .
voting must then take place within 60 days of that announcement. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

belgium 's center-right government collapsed on monday , four days after the prime minister tendered his resignation in a dispute between french and flemish speakers over language and political rights . belgium 's king albert ii has accepted the resignation of prime minister yves leterme 's coalition government amidst feuding between flemish and french speakers over the apportionment of a bilingual brussels electoral district .
it is the third time in as many years that leterme offered to step down when faced by intractable disputes .
" the king has accepted the resignation of the government , " a short statement said , after finance minister didier reynders asked to be relieved of his three-day mission to broker a political solution for deep-rooted linguistic differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister leterme has now quit his job three times the collapse of the government was triggered after the flemish-speaking open vld party announced last week that it was leaving the coalition over controversial plans to redraw the boundaries of the brussels halle-vilvoorde electoral district .
belgium 's constitutional court ruled in 2003 that the so-called bhv district , the only bilingual constituency in the country , would have to be reapportioned .
since then , belgian leaders have remained at loggerheads over flemish demands to make parts of the district monolingual and francophone calls to allow voters throughout the district to support french-speaking political parties .
the downfall of leterme , who will stay on initially in a caretaker capacity , comes at a highly inopportune moment , a little over two months before belgium is slated to take over the european union 's rotating presidency on july 1. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a press conference on monday , lies hebbadj , an algerian-born 35 year-old butcher , responded to suggestions by french interior minister brice hortefeux that he should lose his french passport because he was believed to have four wives who had given him 12 children who were all receiving welfare benefits .
" as far as i know , it is not forbidden to have mistresses in france , nor is it forbidden under islam , " said hebbadj .
" if you lose your french nationality for having mistresses , then a lot of french men would have been stripped of their citizenship . "
hebbadj became a french citizen in 1999 , after marrying a woman with french nationality .
hebbadj 's case received political and media attention after his wife was stopped and fined by police in nantes for driving while wearing a full-face veil , known as a " niqab " .
she was fined 22 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- on april 2 because police said the veil restricted her view and compromised her ability to drive safely .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says full veils are not welcome in france french opinion polls show that 64 percent of the population either support a full ban on the niqab and burqa or approve of them at least being outlawed from state institutions .
the head of the french council of the muslim faith , mohamed moussaoui , said hebbadj 's case had been inflated by the media .
" if there was polygamy , the laws are clear on that and muslims in france are respectful of laws , " said moussaoui .

at a press conference on monday , lies hebbadj , an algerian-born 35 year-old butcher , responded to suggestions by french interior minister brice hortefeux that he should lose his french passport because he was believed to have four wives who had given him 12 children who were all receiving welfare benefits .
" as far as i know , it is not forbidden to have mistresses in france , nor is it forbidden under islam , " said hebbadj .
" if you lose your french nationality for having mistresses , then a lot of french men would have been stripped of their citizenship . "
hebbadj became a french citizen in 1999 , after marrying a woman with french nationality .
hebbadj 's case received political and media attention after his wife was stopped and fined by police in nantes for driving while wearing a full-face veil , known as a " niqab " .
she was fined 22 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- on april 2 because police said the veil restricted her view and compromised her ability to drive safely .
she has so far refused to pay the fine .
unveiled controversy the political row over hebbadj comes as the french government is preparing legislation to ban the wearing of the full-face veil .
french president nicolas sarkozy has said that the veil is " not welcome " in france , calling it an affront to french values that denigrates women .
however , sarkozy 's critics say he is simply pandering to far-right voters after his party 's defeat in regional elections last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says full veils are not welcome in france french opinion polls show that 64 percent of the population either support a full ban on the niqab and burqa or approve of them at least being outlawed from state institutions .
the head of the french council of the muslim faith , mohamed moussaoui , said hebbadj 's case had been inflated by the media .
" if there was polygamy , the laws are clear on that and muslims in france are respectful of laws , " said moussaoui .
he added that , in contrast , a weekend gun attack on a mosque in southern france had received little attention .

as he takes a group through the security checkpoint , he points to fresh cut flowers which have been left near the gates . " that was put there for the anniversary .
people who used to live here , they come here .
they are the veterans of chernobyl . " a dead city the city of pripyat lies just two kilometers from the chernobyl plant .
it was a model city , created to house chernobyl employees and their families .
these days , it is a ghost town .
wire , debris and old furniture litter the darkened hallways of the deserted soviet apartment blocks . but despite continued looting , zabarin says it is too dangerous to knock the buildings down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pripyat was completely abandoned following the explosion " if they explode buildings , a radiation cloud will spread all over europe .
even to canada and the united states .
now we are waiting .
all these buildings will fall down in ten or fifteen years .
one school already collapsed . " the road out of pripyat is dotted with dilapidated cottages which are sinking into their own foundations .
they are masked from the road by a tangle of wild shrubs and tree branches . 116,000 people were evacuated from this region . far-reaching effects today , it is unclear if the evacuations were necessary .
uprooted communities have suffered severe social problems . when the reactor exploded , the soviet government , which controlled ukraine at the time , failed to notify the people who lived here .
for days , people went about their lives completely unaware that they were being exposed to radiation . according to pavlo zamostyan of the united nations development program , this had serious social and psychological consequences for chernobyl-affected communities . " fears and uncertainty created in the first months and years , when the soviet government failed to tell the truth about the scale of the accident , created a specific psychological trauma in the affected population .
a so-called ' victim syndrome . " ' radiation exposure led to an increase in cancer and widespread birth defects .
but zamostyan says the most toxic element in chernobyl-affected communities now , is a deep-rooted pessimism which has prevented survivors from moving forward with their lives . overcoming chernobyl the stigma of chernobyl has convinced many survivors that they are sick and incapable – and zamostyan says the government compensation program is making the problem worse . " we have to combat the paternalistic system , which is fine for an emergency situation , when ... a strong centralised system of actions is needed - military type operations , evacuation , resettlement .
but for longtime recovery , it ’ s not acceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosion threw up a cloud of radioactive dust as part of its effort to combat the psychological and social effects of the chernobyl incident , the undp is supporting the borodianka center of psycho-social rehabilitation . sasha starovoitenko is a radiation educator with the center .
he was a liquidator who was deployed to the exclusion zone after chernobyl exploded .
his crew carried appliances and furniture out of the deserted apartments and dumped them in 100 meter deep pits , where they remain buried to this day . he remembers standing on a bridge near pripyat after the evacuation . " barbed wire .
empty houses .
it felt like being in outer space .
no one is there .
i remember big black dogs .
what were they doing there ?
what were they eating ? " thousands of survivors were resettled in the region of borodianka , which is where starovoitenko lives .
but he says even those who didn ’ t get sick were marked by the experience . " they had no work .
poor health and no money to improve their health .
so , they started drinking vodka , as if that would help , " says starovoitenko .
he was told by a doctor that drinking vodka would help stimulate his circulation and make the radiation " fly away . " " so we were drinking .
even driving drunk .
i got so drunk i almost lost my family , " he explains . starovoitenko decided he wanted to change things .
with the support of the borodianka center of psycho-social rehabilitation , he started a chapter of alcoholics anonymous .
he now works at the center , offering radiation education programs for people in chernobyl-affected communities . international help this is the kind of change the pavlo zamostyan from the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- says he wants to see : chernobyl survivors becoming advocates for change in their own lives . the undp is challenging chernobyl-affected communities to move away from government compensation and to dream up plans for businesses and social enterprises .
if they can raise half the money themselves , the undp will step in with the rest .
zamostyan says this helps break the cycle of dependence which has paralyzed chernobyl survivors . " at that moment , people change psychology , attitude towards life .
they understand that in order to have something in village you don ’ t have to wait for government – you can initiate .
the psychological part is more important - people see they have power and everything depends on their wish and willingness to live normally . "

" the president 's life cut tragically short , and the death of poland 's patriotic elite , means one thing to us : we must complete their mission , " jaroslaw kaczynski said in a statement announcing his candidacy .
" we owe this to them ; we owe this to our nation , " he said .
jaroslaw , the elder twin by 45 minutes , heads the opposition right-wing law and justice party and served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 .
he lost that job to donald tusk of the civic platform , who is currently prime minister , in snap elections in november 2007 .
kaczynski said he 'd decided to campaign for the presidential job because poland was a shared responsibility that " demands overcoming personal suffering . "
public mood hard to predict in a recently published poll that had assumed jaroslaw kaczynski would run for president , he received about 26 percent support from those surveyed .
poland 's acting president , bronislaw komorowski , led the poll with nearly 50 percent support as the candidate for the governing , center-right civic platform .
but the public mood is difficult to gauge after the fatal plane accident , which wiped out much of poland 's military and political elite .
" this is not a normal election , " said krzysztof bobinski , director of the warsaw think-tank , unia and polska foundation .
" in reality , it wo n't be him -lrb- jaroslaw -rrb- running , it will be his brother .
his campaign will play on sympathy for his brother . "
all political parties had until this monday to notify the national election commission of their respective candidates .
each candidate must now gather 100,000 signatures of support by may 6 .
under the polish constitution , the date for presidential elections must be announced within two weeks of a sitting president 's death .
voting must then take place within 60 days of that announcement. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jaroslaw , the elder twin by 45 minutes , heads the opposition right-wing law and justice party and served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 .
he lost that job to donald tusk of the civic platform , who is currently prime minister , in snap elections in november 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 26.04.2010 serbian boy activist threatened with violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pocesta is a vocal pro-western advocate a twelve-year-old boy in serbia has begun receiving violent threats from ultranationalists for his outspoken pro-western views . in serbia , finding widespread public support for topics such as kosovo 's independence and nato membership is not exactly easy .
nationalism is still strong in the balkan state , and liberal pro-western advocates are in the minority .
but recently , that minority has been getting more attention - all because of a twelve-year-old boy named rastko pocesta .
as a young pro-western social activist , pocesta has gained fame through articles he 's published on blogs and facebook , which campaign for serbia to join the european union and nato .
he also supports the independence of kosovo , despite the serbian government 's stance that it is not a separate country .
" serbia should be a country in which human , civil , political and minority rights are maximally respected , " rastko said .
" it should be a country which is not seen through the wars in the 1990 's and the war crimes but by its involvement in international affairs . "
rastko added that serbian membership in the eu would bring economic stability and prosperty .
the young activist also believes nato membership would help improve the security of all serbs .
harsh feedback despite his young age , pocesta is not immune from violent threats made via the internet .
ultranationalists within serbia have begun to take notice of his work and say he 's betrayed serb values .
one post on the forum of a right-wing group known as obraz read ; " we should break this kid 's bones , and then his ideas . "
obraz considers any pro-western serb to be a traitor , since nato bombed the country during the kosovo war in the late 1990 's .
ultranationalists still have a strong presence in serbian society , as they regularly take part in street protests .
in 2008 , after the united states declared its support for kosovo 's independence , the american embassy in belgrade was set on fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultranationalist mladen obradovic opposes pocesta 's pro-western views pocesta has been given official protection , but says the threats will not stop him from doing his work .
" i 'll continue being a human rights activist and i 'll never step down , no matter what threats , " said pocesta .
" if i step down , it will be the failure of democracy in this country .
it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
mladen obradovic , the general secretary of obraz , did not think the violent threats on the group 's website were serious , but nevertheless does not approve of pocesta 's views .
" there is something wrong with this boy , " said obradovic .
" but i hope , since he 's still very young , that there is enough time for him to become a better pupil , a better serb , a better christian , a better person . "
political tug-of-war pocesta 's story reflects a larger political struggle within serbia , with one liberal side keen to move on from the past , and the other remaining fiercely nationalistic .
serbia 's pro-western government applied for eu membership at the end of last year .
the eu boosted serbia 's bid by unfreezing a free trade agreement with belgrade as well as allowing visa-free travel throughout the schengen zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu integration is not popular with all serbs however , kosovo 's declaration of independence in 2008 still remains an issue between the eu and serbia , as all but five eu members now recognize kosovo as an independent state .
pocesta does have at least one fan within serbia 's government , marko karadzic , the state secretary for human rights .
karadzic says he shares pocesta 's desire to eradicate the remnants of serbia 's violent past .
" you still have those violent groups and they simply do n't see themselves in a system where you have rules , " said karadzic .
" this is completely unacceptable because we have to show that we have learnt about the evil of war and violence and that we are going to fight against it . "

make lots of contacts , go out to eat as often as possible , be very patient , constantly think about " keeping face " - these are suggestions made by a german veteran of business with china . the number of western businesses searching for a new home is continually growing .
there are many different reasons they are leaving .
many end up going to china , thinking business is much easier there .
but the rules that apply are different than those in the west and they are consistent , according to a man who has been doing business for 25 years in the people 's republic .
due to high production costs , manfred grundt of naimextraiders , a german company that produces natural sausage casing , moved his production facilities to china over 20 years ago .
there , he employs over 800 people who work to produce the casing of germany 's national food , the bratwurst .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred grundt 's firm produces sausage casing in china self experience the numbers speak loudly and clearly ; if manfred grundt were to still produce his sausage casing in germany , he would have to pay a monthly average of 4,500 euros -lrb- 6,000 dollars -rrb- for each employee .
in china it is only 595 euros -lrb- 800 dollars -rrb- , and this is still considered a well-paid job in china .
what started out as a small project in the 1970s became a joint venture in 1986 .
and back then , neither germany nor the european community offered diplomatic nor financial support .
manfred grundt was a pioneer in his field .
and nobody knows better than him what it takes to do business in china .
" those who have patience , and who invest time and create friendships are the ones who are successful , " says the german business man .
" one thing is for sure in the people 's republic of china : the chinese are proud business people . "
when in china ...
when doing business it is also important not to " lose face " , neither your own , nor cause someone else to " lose " theirs .
this is one very important custom in the land of the dragon .
and only people who truly respect the customs of the chinese partners ' culture will really be able to make money .
aside from being extremely polite , eating out with business partners is also very important .
" those who fail to establish a network of business contacts will not be successful in china , " grundt warns .
" i am not talking about bribery , but simply about meetings with food and drinks .
to this day we meet with the veterinary authority each quarter and with customs because we have known each other for so long .
some of the veterinarians from back then are ministers in beijing now . "
bildunterschrift : the shanghai skyline : the symbol of wealth and business long road to success but it is a long and sometimes difficult road to this kind of success .
networking , trust and friendships take time .
you need a great amount of patience , a foreign concept for most german companies .
manfred grundt tells medium-sized business owners : " if you take the bureaucratic road , do n't expect to get anything done in less than two years .
whoever thinks they will be making great business deals in china in less than two years is going to lose . "
these principles do n't only apply to western entrepreneurs .
the same goes for politicians .
they have also had to go through the same difficult learning process .
grundt thinks they have started taking the right approach in the last five years .
had grundt not learned this lesson over 20 years ago , he says he probably would n't be where he is today .
he also says at least 80 percent of companies in his branch would n't exist today if it were n't for china .

at a press conference on monday , lies hebbadj , an algerian-born 35 year-old butcher , responded to suggestions by french interior minister brice hortefeux that he should lose his french passport because he was believed to have four wives who had given him 12 children who were all receiving welfare benefits .
" as far as i know , it is not forbidden to have mistresses in france , nor is it forbidden under islam , " said hebbadj .
" if you lose your french nationality for having mistresses , then a lot of french men would have been stripped of their citizenship . "
hebbadj became a french citizen in 1999 , after marrying a woman with french nationality .
hebbadj 's case received political and media attention after his wife was stopped and fined by police in nantes for driving while wearing a full-face veil , known as a " niqab " .
she was fined 22 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- on april 2 because police said the veil restricted her view and compromised her ability to drive safely .

" a program must be agreed on between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and greece " before any concrete financial aid can be offered by the european union , merkel said .

" a program must be agreed on between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and greece " before any concrete financial aid can be offered by the european union , merkel said .
berlin 's stance was criticized by italian foreign minister franco frattini , who said he was " concerned by the intransigence " germany was showing .
" this is not a rescue operation .
this is a consolidation of europe 's walls ; the walls of the euro .
it 's a rescue for all of us , " frattini said .
deftly sidestepping the words " bailout " or " default " , merkel did , however , emphasize that -lrb- eu -rrb- government guarantees were " indispensable " to ensure that a greek austerity program effectively tackled the country 's massive deficit .
but , despite her attempts to reassure financial markets , investors on monday battered greek bonds , sending the yield , or borrowing rate , on benchmark 10-year government bonds soaring to 9.4 percent .
euro exit ' not an option ' for greece chancellor merkel said it was up to greece to convince the world that it had a " credible " debt-reduction plan and that germany was prepared when that became evident .
she said she had " confidence " in the negotiations greece was conducting with the imf and the european union .
she stressed that expelling greece from the euro currency zone was " not an option " , warning that such talk only fueled uncertainty in the marketplace .
" what we need is a quick reaction for the stability of the eurozone as a whole and everything that takes us away from this central goal is , at the moment , not an option .
we do not need uncertainty , but certainty , " merkel said .
the chancellor predicted that it would be only a " matter of days " before a rescue package for greece was nailed down. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , after only nine months , he 's been given the pink slip , as the club tries to salvage its season .
but there 's little left to salvage . hamburg 's board of directors announced labbadia would be leaving the club involuntarily on monday , one day after the team suffered a disastrous 5-1 loss to hoffenheim in the bundesliga and three days before a crucial away tie to fulham in the europa league semi-finals .
" we can not and did not want to continue in this formation , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told reporters after meeting with labbadia .
" we found we could n't expect to win against fulham .
it was the last point at which we could act so as not to endanger our season goal of qualifying for europe . "
but hamburg 's chances are already in grave danger .
in seventh place in the table , and five points behind sixth-placed stuttgart , hamburg 's prospects of qualifying via the league are slim-to-none .
hamburg 's best bet is to win the europa cup outright .
but their desultory nil-nil draw in their home tie against fulham last week hardly put them in an ideal position to do that .
" labbadia is a dead issue , " a representative of the hamburg board declared tersely to reporters earlier on monday .
and it all started so well bildunterschrift : it 's been a painful 2010 for the northern german side this was supposed to be hamburg 's year .
after a few seasons of relative austerity , hofmann loosened the purse strings this summer , bringing in highly coveted young talents eljero elia and marcus berg , veteran midfielder ze roberto and labbadia , whose move from leverkusen is reported to have cost 1.3 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- .
many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .
hamburg were fourth over the winter break , and when hofmann brought in veteran star ruud van nistelrooy in january to bolster an injury-prone attack , many people considered the northern germans a dark-horse candidate for the title .
ca n't we all just get along ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero is just one player who 's lost his orientation but little , if anything , has gone right in 2010 for hamburg .
since the break , the team has managed only four wins in 15 matches , forgetting how to score goals in the process .
part of that was due to injuries .
ze roberto , and hamburg 's most reliable striker mladen petric , missed significant action this year , and elia , who looked like a winner , is out for the rest of the season .
but disciplinary problems and internal rancor have been equally , if not more , significant in hamburg 's tumble .
peruvian striker paolo guerrero went awol for weeks , claiming he was too afraid of flying to return from his home country , where he was recovering from a knee injury .
and when he did finally arrive in hamburg , he promptly got himself suspended for the rest of the season for throwing a water bottle at a fan - critics said it was the best aim he 'd displayed in months .
moreover , both van nistelrooy and team captain and goalkeeper frank rost publicly criticized labbadia , with the dutch striker questioning the coach 's ability to communicate tactics .
technique coach ricardo moniz now takes over on an interim basis , as hamburg attempt to put the pieces back together .
his first assignment is in fulham on thursday .

now , after only nine months , he 's been given the pink slip , as the club tries to salvage its season .
but there 's little left to salvage . hamburg 's board of directors announced labbadia would be leaving the club involuntarily on monday , one day after the team suffered a disastrous 5-1 loss to hoffenheim in the bundesliga and three days before a crucial away tie to fulham in the europa league semi-finals .
" we can not and did not want to continue in this formation , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told reporters after meeting with labbadia .
" we found we could n't expect to win against fulham .
it was the last point at which we could act so as not to endanger our season goal of qualifying for europe . "
but hamburg 's chances are already in grave danger .
in seventh place in the table , and five points behind sixth-placed stuttgart , hamburg 's prospects of qualifying via the league are slim-to-none .
hamburg 's best bet is to win the europa cup outright .
but their desultory nil-nil draw in their home tie against fulham last week hardly put them in an ideal position to do that .
" labbadia is a dead issue , " a representative of the hamburg board declared tersely to reporters earlier on monday .
and it all started so well bildunterschrift : it 's been a painful 2010 for the northern german side this was supposed to be hamburg 's year .
after a few seasons of relative austerity , hofmann loosened the purse strings this summer , bringing in highly coveted young talents eljero elia and marcus berg , veteran midfielder ze roberto and labbadia , whose move from leverkusen is reported to have cost 1.3 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- .
many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .
hamburg were fourth over the winter break , and when hofmann brought in veteran star ruud van nistelrooy in january to bolster an injury-prone attack , many people considered the northern germans a dark-horse candidate for the title .
ca n't we all just get along ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero is just one player who 's lost his orientation but little , if anything , has gone right in 2010 for hamburg .
since the break , the team has managed only four wins in 15 matches , forgetting how to score goals in the process .
part of that was due to injuries .
ze roberto , and hamburg 's most reliable striker mladen petric , missed significant action this year , and elia , who looked like a winner , is out for the rest of the season .
but disciplinary problems and internal rancor have been equally , if not more , significant in hamburg 's tumble .
peruvian striker paolo guerrero went awol for weeks , claiming he was too afraid of flying to return from his home country , where he was recovering from a knee injury .
and when he did finally arrive in hamburg , he promptly got himself suspended for the rest of the season for throwing a water bottle at a fan - critics said it was the best aim he 'd displayed in months .
moreover , both van nistelrooy and team captain and goalkeeper frank rost publicly criticized labbadia , with the dutch striker questioning the coach 's ability to communicate tactics .
technique coach ricardo moniz now takes over on an interim basis , as hamburg attempt to put the pieces back together .
his first assignment is in fulham on thursday .

make lots of contacts , go out to eat as often as possible , be very patient , constantly think about " keeping face " - these are suggestions made by a german veteran of business with china . the number of western businesses searching for a new home is continually growing .
there are many different reasons they are leaving .
many end up going to china , thinking business is much easier there .
but the rules that apply are different than those in the west and they are consistent , according to a man who has been doing business for 25 years in the people 's republic .
due to high production costs , manfred grundt of naimextraiders , a german company that produces natural sausage casing , moved his production facilities to china over 20 years ago .
there , he employs over 800 people who work to produce the casing of germany 's national food , the bratwurst .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred grundt 's firm produces sausage casing in china self experience the numbers speak loudly and clearly ; if manfred grundt were to still produce his sausage casing in germany , he would have to pay a monthly average of 4,500 euros -lrb- 6,000 dollars -rrb- for each employee .
in china it is only 595 euros -lrb- 800 dollars -rrb- , and this is still considered a well-paid job in china .
what started out as a small project in the 1970s became a joint venture in 1986 .
and back then , neither germany nor the european community offered diplomatic nor financial support .
manfred grundt was a pioneer in his field .
and nobody knows better than him what it takes to do business in china .
" those who have patience , and who invest time and create friendships are the ones who are successful , " says the german business man .
" one thing is for sure in the people 's republic of china : the chinese are proud business people . "
when in china ...
when doing business it is also important not to " lose face " , neither your own , nor cause someone else to " lose " theirs .
this is one very important custom in the land of the dragon .
and only people who truly respect the customs of the chinese partners ' culture will really be able to make money .
aside from being extremely polite , eating out with business partners is also very important .
" those who fail to establish a network of business contacts will not be successful in china , " grundt warns .
" i am not talking about bribery , but simply about meetings with food and drinks .
to this day we meet with the veterinary authority each quarter and with customs because we have known each other for so long .
some of the veterinarians from back then are ministers in beijing now . "
bildunterschrift : the shanghai skyline : the symbol of wealth and business long road to success but it is a long and sometimes difficult road to this kind of success .
networking , trust and friendships take time .
you need a great amount of patience , a foreign concept for most german companies .
manfred grundt tells medium-sized business owners : " if you take the bureaucratic road , do n't expect to get anything done in less than two years .
whoever thinks they will be making great business deals in china in less than two years is going to lose . "
these principles do n't only apply to western entrepreneurs .
the same goes for politicians .
they have also had to go through the same difficult learning process .
grundt thinks they have started taking the right approach in the last five years .
had grundt not learned this lesson over 20 years ago , he says he probably would n't be where he is today .
he also says at least 80 percent of companies in his branch would n't exist today if it were n't for china .

many questions are being asked by politicians , the airlines and scientists about a phenomenon that could occur at any time and , according to past trends , could be even more severe .
airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by volcanoes .
jet engines can suck in volcanic ash , which melts in the intense heat . the turbine blades are then coated and can clog up and fail .
it has the makings of a potential catastrophe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1.2 million passengers per day were affected so when the huge cloud of ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano drifted into british airspace , the uk 's air industry regulator banned all commercial flights .
more than a dozen other countries - including germany and france - followed that example , closing their airspace either partially or fully .
" volcanic ash and jet engines do n't mix , so safety is our number one priority , " said bob jones , the uk regulator 's head of operations .
" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .

many questions are being asked by politicians , the airlines and scientists about a phenomenon that could occur at any time and , according to past trends , could be even more severe .
airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by volcanoes .
jet engines can suck in volcanic ash , which melts in the intense heat . the turbine blades are then coated and can clog up and fail .
it has the makings of a potential catastrophe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1.2 million passengers per day were affected so when the huge cloud of ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano drifted into british airspace , the uk 's air industry regulator banned all commercial flights .
more than a dozen other countries - including germany and france - followed that example , closing their airspace either partially or fully .
" volcanic ash and jet engines do n't mix , so safety is our number one priority , " said bob jones , the uk regulator 's head of operations .
" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .
" where you have a small chance of that happening , it would be very wrong to say , let 's give it a try .
this is a matter of life and death . "
but as the flight ban dragged on , it quickly became more a matter of life and death for the airlines , which were losing about 150 million euros a day .
some were in danger of going under financially and they began to complain that the authorities had overreacted . incomplete analysis british weather forecasters used a computer program to predict where the wind would carry the ash cloud and how quickly it would disperse .

and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .
back in black bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli fans are a colorful , fun-loving bunch if lautern are one of the bundesliga 's most storied teams , st. pauli are without doubt the hippest .
the club has only spent a total of five years in the first division and its greatest success was beating the then world club champions bayern munich , but results are not the source of its appeal .
the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .
back in black bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli fans are a colorful , fun-loving bunch if lautern are one of the bundesliga 's most storied teams , st. pauli are without doubt the hippest .
the club has only spent a total of five years in the first division and its greatest success was beating the then world club champions bayern munich , but results are not the source of its appeal .
the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .
back in black bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli fans are a colorful , fun-loving bunch if lautern are one of the bundesliga 's most storied teams , st. pauli are without doubt the hippest .
the club has only spent a total of five years in the first division and its greatest success was beating the then world club champions bayern munich , but results are not the source of its appeal .
the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

his goal is to get a foot in the door for german business ahead of the 2014 football world cup and 2016 olympics to be hosted by the emerging economic powerhouse .
but it is not only a mutual love of football that bruederle will be using to bridge the divide between the two countries .
brazilians have also taken to heart , and stomach , the german art of brewing beer .
the setting is a modestly sized city called blumenau , which most would assume lies somewhere near the black forest or perhaps along one of germany 's many rivers .
however this city can not be found in germany , or anywhere on the european continent .
it lies in the south of brazil and has become home to what it claims is the world 's second-largest beer festival after oktoberfest in munich .
the city was founded by germans around 160 years ago and is now home to hundreds of thousands of their descendents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenau is a home away from home for germans the city hosts a collection of small breweries that have carried on the world-renowned tradition of german beer-making under the labels " eisenbahn , " " schornstein , " and simply " das bier . "
lasting legacy master brewer claudio jose gonzales de matos says brazilians have taken up beer making and drinking with as much passion as the germans who brought their special recipes to the country so long ago .
" we live here in a tropical country and year after year , beer consumption has continued to rise substantially .
in particular , small breweries here in brazil are growing very fast , " he says .
" they have revived the traditional brewing techniques and distanced themselves from the more modern industrial-style methods .
today , there are many small breweries in brazil producing beer of high quality . "
every year , brazilians consume around 10 billion liters of beer - just one billion short of germans - and the south american country now represents the fourth-largest beer market in the world .
mass produced , mainstream beer labels still dominate in brazil , but small breweries are staging a comeback , and have trebled their market share to six percent in recent years .
bildunterschrift : brazilians are warming to beer culture solid foundation brewer pedro paulo moretzohn , who spent many years perfecting his brewing techniques in europe , believes that german beer-making methods are underpinning the fight back of micro-breweries in brazil .
" these new enterprises sprang mainly from german culture in cities like blumenau and others nearby , " he says .
" but also because people want beers with a variety of tastes .
here our beers are virtually without additives - nothing other than grain varieties such as malt , hops and wheat .
that gives these beers a very special characteristic . "
behind the boom are more than 100 micro-breweries producing " cervejas artesanais , " or hand-crafted beers , with varieties including yeast beers , dark beers and even koelsch-style beers popular in the areas surrounding the western german city of cologne .
despite the quality beer offered by micro-breweries , a mass-produced , light , watery version of a pilsner still dominates the brazilian market .
but brewing instructor ligia marcondes believes the market for high-quality beer is continuously growing in the country of nearly 190 million , especially among the middle class .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still enjoy their beer more than brazilians " for example , today i can say that i love hoppy beers , whereas earlier , i might have thought those beers were too bitter , " she says .
" at the moment i like wheat beer , but of course , i 'll still try new beers .
i like full-bodied beers .
bitter beers , too .
so you could say i have changed my consumption habits a little . "
raising the bar so successful have some micro-breweries been that they 've forced some larger brazilian breweries to rethink their beer-making ethos , leading to an improvement in the quality of some mass-produced labels .
brewing specialist cilene saorin says what is needed is a shift in paradigm by both beer makers and consumers .
" we need to work on our drinking culture and improve knowledge of beer culture , " she says .
" we have to explain that pilsner is not the only beer , but that there are over 100 different varieties and that different beers suit different occasions .
this process of education will take time " .
" we 've already made a lot of progress over the last five years .
give us another five years and you 'll see that the market will have evolved . "

lasting legacy master brewer claudio jose gonzales de matos says brazilians have taken up beer making and drinking with as much passion as the germans who brought their special recipes to the country so long ago .
" we live here in a tropical country and year after year , beer consumption has continued to rise substantially .
in particular , small breweries here in brazil are growing very fast , " he says .
" they have revived the traditional brewing techniques and distanced themselves from the more modern industrial-style methods .
today , there are many small breweries in brazil producing beer of high quality . "
every year , brazilians consume around 10 billion liters of beer - just one billion short of germans - and the south american country now represents the fourth-largest beer market in the world .
mass produced , mainstream beer labels still dominate in brazil , but small breweries are staging a comeback , and have trebled their market share to six percent in recent years .
bildunterschrift : brazilians are warming to beer culture solid foundation brewer pedro paulo moretzohn , who spent many years perfecting his brewing techniques in europe , believes that german beer-making methods are underpinning the fight back of micro-breweries in brazil .
" these new enterprises sprang mainly from german culture in cities like blumenau and others nearby , " he says .
" but also because people want beers with a variety of tastes .
here our beers are virtually without additives - nothing other than grain varieties such as malt , hops and wheat .
that gives these beers a very special characteristic . "
behind the boom are more than 100 micro-breweries producing " cervejas artesanais , " or hand-crafted beers , with varieties including yeast beers , dark beers and even koelsch-style beers popular in the areas surrounding the western german city of cologne .
despite the quality beer offered by micro-breweries , a mass-produced , light , watery version of a pilsner still dominates the brazilian market .
but brewing instructor ligia marcondes believes the market for high-quality beer is continuously growing in the country of nearly 190 million , especially among the middle class .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still enjoy their beer more than brazilians " for example , today i can say that i love hoppy beers , whereas earlier , i might have thought those beers were too bitter , " she says .
" at the moment i like wheat beer , but of course , i 'll still try new beers .
i like full-bodied beers .
bitter beers , too .
so you could say i have changed my consumption habits a little . "
raising the bar so successful have some micro-breweries been that they 've forced some larger brazilian breweries to rethink their beer-making ethos , leading to an improvement in the quality of some mass-produced labels .
brewing specialist cilene saorin says what is needed is a shift in paradigm by both beer makers and consumers .
" we need to work on our drinking culture and improve knowledge of beer culture , " she says .
" we have to explain that pilsner is not the only beer , but that there are over 100 different varieties and that different beers suit different occasions .
this process of education will take time " .
" we 've already made a lot of progress over the last five years .
give us another five years and you 'll see that the market will have evolved . "

his goal is to get a foot in the door for german business ahead of the 2014 football world cup and 2016 olympics to be hosted by the emerging economic powerhouse .
but it is not only a mutual love of football that bruederle will be using to bridge the divide between the two countries .
brazilians have also taken to heart , and stomach , the german art of brewing beer .
the setting is a modestly sized city called blumenau , which most would assume lies somewhere near the black forest or perhaps along one of germany 's many rivers .
however this city can not be found in germany , or anywhere on the european continent .
it lies in the south of brazil and has become home to what it claims is the world 's second-largest beer festival after oktoberfest in munich .

at a press conference on monday , lies hebbadj , an algerian-born 35 year-old butcher , responded to suggestions by french interior minister brice hortefeux that he should lose his french passport because he was believed to have four wives who had given him 12 children who were all receiving welfare benefits .
" as far as i know , it is not forbidden to have mistresses in france , nor is it forbidden under islam , " said hebbadj .
" if you lose your french nationality for having mistresses , then a lot of french men would have been stripped of their citizenship . "
hebbadj became a french citizen in 1999 , after marrying a woman with french nationality .
hebbadj 's case received political and media attention after his wife was stopped and fined by police in nantes for driving while wearing a full-face veil , known as a " niqab " .
she was fined 22 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- on april 2 because police said the veil restricted her view and compromised her ability to drive safely .
she has so far refused to pay the fine .
unveiled controversy the political row over hebbadj comes as the french government is preparing legislation to ban the wearing of the full-face veil .
french president nicolas sarkozy has said that the veil is " not welcome " in france , calling it an affront to french values that denigrates women .
however , sarkozy 's critics say he is simply pandering to far-right voters after his party 's defeat in regional elections last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says full veils are not welcome in france french opinion polls show that 64 percent of the population either support a full ban on the niqab and burqa or approve of them at least being outlawed from state institutions .
the head of the french council of the muslim faith , mohamed moussaoui , said hebbadj 's case had been inflated by the media .
" if there was polygamy , the laws are clear on that and muslims in france are respectful of laws , " said moussaoui .
he added that , in contrast , a weekend gun attack on a mosque in southern france had received little attention .
a draft law for the ban on full-face veils is set to be presented to french ministers next month. mk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a plight that affects thousands of immigrants in germany . in multicultural berlin , it 's not unusual to find immigrant children and teens who are struggling with integration issues – despite having all the documents they need to live legally in germany .
but for lial , hassan , and maradona akkouch , it 's a different story .
the siblings have lived in berlin for as long as they can remember , but every day , they fear their family could be deported back to their native lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film won a prize at this year 's berlinale now , a documentary about the siblings ' lives has hit german movie screens .
filmmakers agostino imondi and dietmar ratsch of indi film followed the teenagers over a period of several years , documenting all aspects of their lives : at home with their mother , at school or vocational training , at the immigration office , and at the clubs where they give free rein to their passion for rap , hip hop , and street dance .
the result is a film which has earned critical acclaim , including from the jury of this year 's berlinale , where " neukoelln unlimited " won the crystal bear for best film in the category generation14plus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmmakers imondi -lrb- left -rrb- and ratsch followed the family for years the film had its national cinema release on april 8 , meaning that a wider audience can now delve into a world that most germans do n't know exists .
neukoelln is berlin 's most multi-ethnic neighborhood , home to the akkouch family and others who , like them , never manage to feel truly at home .
that 's because , despite moving here almost 20 years ago , the members of the akkouch family have never been granted residency permits .
instead , they have what 's called " exceptional leave to remain . "
they can be deported any time at short notice , and their movements are very limited .
maradona , who is now 16 , laughs bitterly when asked how his residency status impacts his life .
" my status is basically a piece of paper that folds in three , with a red line through it , and because of this piece of paper , i 'm not allowed to travel outside the city of berlin .
i ca n't open a bank account , get a driver 's license , and i 'm not allowed to work - nothing , " he says on the sidelines of the " neukoelln unlimited " premiere .
" a modern cinderella story " maradona is perhaps the film 's most engaging - and most frustrating - character .
he has talent and charisma in spades , and yet he hangs out with a bad crowd , has run-ins with the police , and is frequently suspended from school .
his older brother , hassan , 20 , says maradona 's attitude toward life in germany suffered from the time in 2003 , when the family was woken up by police and told to pack their things .
they were sent back to lebanon the same day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hassan 's rap songs tell his story " the moment the plane took off , it was suddenly clear to me that life is not a game , " hassan says in the film , thinking back to the deportation .
" i think everyone has a moment like that , when they realize that they 're not a kid anymore .
the deportation marked the end of my childhood . "
for the akkouch family , lebanon no longer felt like home .
eventually , they returned to neukoelln , but they are in constant contact with the local immigration authorities , and that has an impact on their lives .
the film shows how hassan constantly needs to update his residency permit in order to pursue a high school diploma .
the family also has to prove that they can look after themselves financially , which makes the siblings even more determined to make money from singing and dancing .
their persistence is what attracted filmmaker imondi to the project .
" what interested me is that it 's the story of a family that does n't give up ; it 's really a modern cinderella story for me , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are a family that , despite all the difficulties , all the walls they encounter , is able to break through these walls as they fight for their right to be here . "
lial , 21 , is hopeful that the film 's release might change things for her family .
both she and hassan have now been granted residency permits , as they are both of legal age .
but her mother and her younger siblings are still in germany on exceptional leave .
if they were to be deported , her family would be split up .
after fighting for so long to remain in neukoelln together , that 's a prospect none of them wants to face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lial practices her dance moves ahead of an event " i hope that the film opens people 's eyes to what we 've gone through , because there are many other families in the same situation , " she says .
" maybe they 'll see it and say to themselves , okay , we wo n't give up either .
and the people higher up , maybe they 'll look down and see that there are people who 've integrated here , who 've grown up here or maybe were born here who are suffering because of their situation . "
" exceptional leave " affects thousands critics have praised the film for showing the complex realities of immigration in germany .
the akkouch family works hard , but they also make mistakes .
they want to integrate , but at the same time , they do n't want to deny their muslim heritage .
and they often get discouraged because their residency status , instead of encouraging integration , can leave them feeling alienated .
it 's a fate shared by some 200,000 people in germany .
" my hope is that the film will start a political discussion , one that asks the question how it 's possible for a family to be living in germany for almost 20 years and still only be tolerated when there are other possibilities to solve the problem , for example , to get a residency permit on humanitarian grounds , " says imondi .
" we hear so much from politicians about integration .
we have a family here that 's perfectly integrated , and yet the system makes their lives so difficult .
why does it have to be like that ? "

neukoelln is berlin 's most multi-ethnic neighborhood , home to the akkouch family and others who , like them , never manage to feel truly at home .
that 's because , despite moving here almost 20 years ago , the members of the akkouch family have never been granted residency permits .
instead , they have what 's called " exceptional leave to remain . "
they can be deported any time at short notice , and their movements are very limited .
maradona , who is now 16 , laughs bitterly when asked how his residency status impacts his life .
" my status is basically a piece of paper that folds in three , with a red line through it , and because of this piece of paper , i 'm not allowed to travel outside the city of berlin .
i ca n't open a bank account , get a driver 's license , and i 'm not allowed to work - nothing , " he says on the sidelines of the " neukoelln unlimited " premiere .
" a modern cinderella story " maradona is perhaps the film 's most engaging - and most frustrating - character .
he has talent and charisma in spades , and yet he hangs out with a bad crowd , has run-ins with the police , and is frequently suspended from school .
his older brother , hassan , 20 , says maradona 's attitude toward life in germany suffered from the time in 2003 , when the family was woken up by police and told to pack their things .
they were sent back to lebanon the same day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hassan 's rap songs tell his story " the moment the plane took off , it was suddenly clear to me that life is not a game , " hassan says in the film , thinking back to the deportation .
" i think everyone has a moment like that , when they realize that they 're not a kid anymore .
the deportation marked the end of my childhood . "
for the akkouch family , lebanon no longer felt like home .
eventually , they returned to neukoelln , but they are in constant contact with the local immigration authorities , and that has an impact on their lives .
the film shows how hassan constantly needs to update his residency permit in order to pursue a high school diploma .
the family also has to prove that they can look after themselves financially , which makes the siblings even more determined to make money from singing and dancing .
their persistence is what attracted filmmaker imondi to the project .
" what interested me is that it 's the story of a family that does n't give up ; it 's really a modern cinderella story for me , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are a family that , despite all the difficulties , all the walls they encounter , is able to break through these walls as they fight for their right to be here . "
lial , 21 , is hopeful that the film 's release might change things for her family .
both she and hassan have now been granted residency permits , as they are both of legal age .
but her mother and her younger siblings are still in germany on exceptional leave .
if they were to be deported , her family would be split up .
after fighting for so long to remain in neukoelln together , that 's a prospect none of them wants to face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lial practices her dance moves ahead of an event " i hope that the film opens people 's eyes to what we 've gone through , because there are many other families in the same situation , " she says .
" maybe they 'll see it and say to themselves , okay , we wo n't give up either .
and the people higher up , maybe they 'll look down and see that there are people who 've integrated here , who 've grown up here or maybe were born here who are suffering because of their situation . "
" exceptional leave " affects thousands critics have praised the film for showing the complex realities of immigration in germany .
the akkouch family works hard , but they also make mistakes .
they want to integrate , but at the same time , they do n't want to deny their muslim heritage .
and they often get discouraged because their residency status , instead of encouraging integration , can leave them feeling alienated .
it 's a fate shared by some 200,000 people in germany .
" my hope is that the film will start a political discussion , one that asks the question how it 's possible for a family to be living in germany for almost 20 years and still only be tolerated when there are other possibilities to solve the problem , for example , to get a residency permit on humanitarian grounds , " says imondi .
" we hear so much from politicians about integration .
we have a family here that 's perfectly integrated , and yet the system makes their lives so difficult .
why does it have to be like that ? "

make lots of contacts , go out to eat as often as possible , be very patient , constantly think about " keeping face " - these are suggestions made by a german veteran of business with china . the number of western businesses searching for a new home is continually growing .
there are many different reasons they are leaving .
many end up going to china , thinking business is much easier there .
but the rules that apply are different than those in the west and they are consistent , according to a man who has been doing business for 25 years in the people 's republic .
due to high production costs , manfred grundt of naimextraiders , a german company that produces natural sausage casing , moved his production facilities to china over 20 years ago .
there , he employs over 800 people who work to produce the casing of germany 's national food , the bratwurst .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred grundt 's firm produces sausage casing in china self experience the numbers speak loudly and clearly ; if manfred grundt were to still produce his sausage casing in germany , he would have to pay a monthly average of 4,500 euros -lrb- 6,000 dollars -rrb- for each employee .
in china it is only 595 euros -lrb- 800 dollars -rrb- , and this is still considered a well-paid job in china .
what started out as a small project in the 1970s became a joint venture in 1986 .
and back then , neither germany nor the european community offered diplomatic nor financial support .
manfred grundt was a pioneer in his field .
and nobody knows better than him what it takes to do business in china .
" those who have patience , and who invest time and create friendships are the ones who are successful , " says the german business man .
" one thing is for sure in the people 's republic of china : the chinese are proud business people . "
when in china ...
when doing business it is also important not to " lose face " , neither your own , nor cause someone else to " lose " theirs .
this is one very important custom in the land of the dragon .
and only people who truly respect the customs of the chinese partners ' culture will really be able to make money .
aside from being extremely polite , eating out with business partners is also very important .
" those who fail to establish a network of business contacts will not be successful in china , " grundt warns .
" i am not talking about bribery , but simply about meetings with food and drinks .
to this day we meet with the veterinary authority each quarter and with customs because we have known each other for so long .
some of the veterinarians from back then are ministers in beijing now . "
bildunterschrift : the shanghai skyline : the symbol of wealth and business long road to success but it is a long and sometimes difficult road to this kind of success .
networking , trust and friendships take time .
you need a great amount of patience , a foreign concept for most german companies .
manfred grundt tells medium-sized business owners : " if you take the bureaucratic road , do n't expect to get anything done in less than two years .
whoever thinks they will be making great business deals in china in less than two years is going to lose . "
these principles do n't only apply to western entrepreneurs .
the same goes for politicians .
they have also had to go through the same difficult learning process .
grundt thinks they have started taking the right approach in the last five years .
had grundt not learned this lesson over 20 years ago , he says he probably would n't be where he is today .
he also says at least 80 percent of companies in his branch would n't exist today if it were n't for china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 26.04.2010 new film shows complex reality of immigrants living in limbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film follows the lives of three talented teens the award-winning documentary " neukoelln unlimited " depicts one family 's struggle to put down roots in berlin , despite the constant threat of deportation .
it 's a plight that affects thousands of immigrants in germany . in multicultural berlin , it 's not unusual to find immigrant children and teens who are struggling with integration issues – despite having all the documents they need to live legally in germany .
but for lial , hassan , and maradona akkouch , it 's a different story .
the siblings have lived in berlin for as long as they can remember , but every day , they fear their family could be deported back to their native lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film won a prize at this year 's berlinale now , a documentary about the siblings ' lives has hit german movie screens .
filmmakers agostino imondi and dietmar ratsch of indi film followed the teenagers over a period of several years , documenting all aspects of their lives : at home with their mother , at school or vocational training , at the immigration office , and at the clubs where they give free rein to their passion for rap , hip hop , and street dance .
the result is a film which has earned critical acclaim , including from the jury of this year 's berlinale , where " neukoelln unlimited " won the crystal bear for best film in the category generation14plus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmmakers imondi -lrb- left -rrb- and ratsch followed the family for years the film had its national cinema release on april 8 , meaning that a wider audience can now delve into a world that most germans do n't know exists .
neukoelln is berlin 's most multi-ethnic neighborhood , home to the akkouch family and others who , like them , never manage to feel truly at home .
that 's because , despite moving here almost 20 years ago , the members of the akkouch family have never been granted residency permits .
instead , they have what 's called " exceptional leave to remain . "
they can be deported any time at short notice , and their movements are very limited .
maradona , who is now 16 , laughs bitterly when asked how his residency status impacts his life .
" my status is basically a piece of paper that folds in three , with a red line through it , and because of this piece of paper , i 'm not allowed to travel outside the city of berlin .
i ca n't open a bank account , get a driver 's license , and i 'm not allowed to work - nothing , " he says on the sidelines of the " neukoelln unlimited " premiere .
" a modern cinderella story " maradona is perhaps the film 's most engaging - and most frustrating - character .
he has talent and charisma in spades , and yet he hangs out with a bad crowd , has run-ins with the police , and is frequently suspended from school .
his older brother , hassan , 20 , says maradona 's attitude toward life in germany suffered from the time in 2003 , when the family was woken up by police and told to pack their things .
they were sent back to lebanon the same day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hassan 's rap songs tell his story " the moment the plane took off , it was suddenly clear to me that life is not a game , " hassan says in the film , thinking back to the deportation .
" i think everyone has a moment like that , when they realize that they 're not a kid anymore .
the deportation marked the end of my childhood . "
for the akkouch family , lebanon no longer felt like home .
eventually , they returned to neukoelln , but they are in constant contact with the local immigration authorities , and that has an impact on their lives .
the film shows how hassan constantly needs to update his residency permit in order to pursue a high school diploma .
the family also has to prove that they can look after themselves financially , which makes the siblings even more determined to make money from singing and dancing .
their persistence is what attracted filmmaker imondi to the project .
" what interested me is that it 's the story of a family that does n't give up ; it 's really a modern cinderella story for me , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are a family that , despite all the difficulties , all the walls they encounter , is able to break through these walls as they fight for their right to be here . "
lial , 21 , is hopeful that the film 's release might change things for her family .
both she and hassan have now been granted residency permits , as they are both of legal age .
but her mother and her younger siblings are still in germany on exceptional leave .
if they were to be deported , her family would be split up .
after fighting for so long to remain in neukoelln together , that 's a prospect none of them wants to face .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lial practices her dance moves ahead of an event " i hope that the film opens people 's eyes to what we 've gone through , because there are many other families in the same situation , " she says .
" maybe they 'll see it and say to themselves , okay , we wo n't give up either .
and the people higher up , maybe they 'll look down and see that there are people who 've integrated here , who 've grown up here or maybe were born here who are suffering because of their situation . "
" exceptional leave " affects thousands critics have praised the film for showing the complex realities of immigration in germany .
the akkouch family works hard , but they also make mistakes .
they want to integrate , but at the same time , they do n't want to deny their muslim heritage .
and they often get discouraged because their residency status , instead of encouraging integration , can leave them feeling alienated .
it 's a fate shared by some 200,000 people in germany .
" my hope is that the film will start a political discussion , one that asks the question how it 's possible for a family to be living in germany for almost 20 years and still only be tolerated when there are other possibilities to solve the problem , for example , to get a residency permit on humanitarian grounds , " says imondi .
" we hear so much from politicians about integration .
we have a family here that 's perfectly integrated , and yet the system makes their lives so difficult .
why does it have to be like that ? "

trading tiles for vegetation , green roofs promise both environmental and economic benefits . standing in the street , you probably would n't notice it . yet dusseldorf , the affluent capital of the western german state of north rhine westphalia , is home to more than 730,000 square meters of greenery above people 's heads . that 's roughly equivalent to 100 football fields spread over some 1,700 buildings and last year this feat won the city an award from the international green roof association -lrb- igra -rrb- . more than just a rooftop garden , a ' green roof ' is a different way of approaching architecture , using vegetation supported by waterproof materials instead of conventional construction materials . green roofs live longer green roofs have a number of benefits , including improved insulation and energy savings , but for some they also represent an aesthetic statement . " we wanted to make our car park more attractive , and at the time , replacing the facade and roof was imminent , " said ernst hagemann , the owner and operator of a green roofed multi-story car park in dusseldorf 's city center . although he admits that being a " nature-lover " influenced his decision when it came time to modernize in the 1980s , he says there were obvious practical benefits to covering his roof in earth and moss . back then , the city of dusseldorf subsidized 50 percent of the cost through a green roofing program .
while green roofs are more expensive to build than standard ones , hagemann saw economic savings in the long run .
" from the cost perspective , it was only marginally more expensive with the subsidy that we received from the city , " he said .
" if you consider that typical roofing felt needs to be repaired every five years or so and that after 12 or 15 years it needs to be completely replaced , then a green roof is definitely cheaper . "
the green roof on hagemann 's multi-story car park has not needed any repairs in the 25 years since it was installed .
this is because the layer of vegetation that has been planted over a waterproofing membrane protects the actual roof underneath it .
and there are other economic advantages too green roofs deliver savings through energy efficiency .
in the summer months , the roofs help save on air conditioning because of their cooling properties , and in winter they help save on heating because of their insulation .
bildunterschrift : green roofs have numerous benefits for the people who live underneath them services rendered they also offer a service to cities as a whole , helping moderate temperatures in the concrete jungle – a major reason why dusseldorf is backing green roof uptake , says katja holzmueller from the city 's environment department .
" the ability of green roofs to reduce thermal heating in cities is our primary motivation to promote green roofing , " she said .
" green roofs absorb rain water and so it evaporates more slowly … -lrb- they -rrb- therefore have a cooling effect . "
this cooling effect is especially interesting for areas that get hot in summer , because of cities ' tendency to trap heat , which can be deadly – especially for the elderly – during heat waves .
the roofs also provide an opportunity for flora and fauna to find room to survive in cities .
according to the berlin-based igra , green roofs especially promote biodiversity , providing shelter and food for bees , butterflies and beetles .
car park owner ernst hagemann is pleased with the little creatures his green roof has attracted , despite its location just off a busy dusseldorf street .
" there are many insects and birds here that were long gone from the city .
i 've seen a wren , chaffinches , greenfinches – all kinds of birds , " he said .
the benefits of green roofs do n't stop here though , according to igra .
they can also enhance the quality of life for city slickers by reducing noise levels , and can reduce flooding and damage to sewer systems because they reduce water run-off by 50-90 percent during storms .

" it 's very important that employees have green areas where they can take a break … important studies about this have been conducted in germany , " said christian schulze-ardey from the bonn-based landscape research , development & construction society , which publishes technical guidelines for green roofs and buildings .
" for example , bmw put a lot of green structure in its offices and the result was a very low rate of illness .

schulze-ardey also believes german expertise in green roofing is highly prized overseas , because of the country 's decades-long experience in engineering the structures .

trading tiles for vegetation , green roofs promise both environmental and economic benefits . standing in the street , you probably would n't notice it . yet dusseldorf , the affluent capital of the western german state of north rhine westphalia , is home to more than 730,000 square meters of greenery above people 's heads . that 's roughly equivalent to 100 football fields spread over some 1,700 buildings and last year this feat won the city an award from the international green roof association -lrb- igra -rrb- . more than just a rooftop garden , a ' green roof ' is a different way of approaching architecture , using vegetation supported by waterproof materials instead of conventional construction materials . green roofs live longer green roofs have a number of benefits , including improved insulation and energy savings , but for some they also represent an aesthetic statement . " we wanted to make our car park more attractive , and at the time , replacing the facade and roof was imminent , " said ernst hagemann , the owner and operator of a green roofed multi-story car park in dusseldorf 's city center . although he admits that being a " nature-lover " influenced his decision when it came time to modernize in the 1980s , he says there were obvious practical benefits to covering his roof in earth and moss . back then , the city of dusseldorf subsidized 50 percent of the cost through a green roofing program .
while green roofs are more expensive to build than standard ones , hagemann saw economic savings in the long run .
" from the cost perspective , it was only marginally more expensive with the subsidy that we received from the city , " he said .
" if you consider that typical roofing felt needs to be repaired every five years or so and that after 12 or 15 years it needs to be completely replaced , then a green roof is definitely cheaper . "
the green roof on hagemann 's multi-story car park has not needed any repairs in the 25 years since it was installed .
this is because the layer of vegetation that has been planted over a waterproofing membrane protects the actual roof underneath it .
and there are other economic advantages too green roofs deliver savings through energy efficiency .
in the summer months , the roofs help save on air conditioning because of their cooling properties , and in winter they help save on heating because of their insulation .
bildunterschrift : green roofs have numerous benefits for the people who live underneath them services rendered they also offer a service to cities as a whole , helping moderate temperatures in the concrete jungle – a major reason why dusseldorf is backing green roof uptake , says katja holzmueller from the city 's environment department .
" the ability of green roofs to reduce thermal heating in cities is our primary motivation to promote green roofing , " she said .
" green roofs absorb rain water and so it evaporates more slowly … -lrb- they -rrb- therefore have a cooling effect . "
this cooling effect is especially interesting for areas that get hot in summer , because of cities ' tendency to trap heat , which can be deadly – especially for the elderly – during heat waves .
the roofs also provide an opportunity for flora and fauna to find room to survive in cities .
according to the berlin-based igra , green roofs especially promote biodiversity , providing shelter and food for bees , butterflies and beetles .
car park owner ernst hagemann is pleased with the little creatures his green roof has attracted , despite its location just off a busy dusseldorf street .
" there are many insects and birds here that were long gone from the city .
i 've seen a wren , chaffinches , greenfinches – all kinds of birds , " he said .
the benefits of green roofs do n't stop here though , according to igra .

bildunterschrift : green roofs have numerous benefits for the people who live underneath them services rendered they also offer a service to cities as a whole , helping moderate temperatures in the concrete jungle – a major reason why dusseldorf is backing green roof uptake , says katja holzmueller from the city 's environment department .
" the ability of green roofs to reduce thermal heating in cities is our primary motivation to promote green roofing , " she said .
" green roofs absorb rain water and so it evaporates more slowly … -lrb- they -rrb- therefore have a cooling effect . "
this cooling effect is especially interesting for areas that get hot in summer , because of cities ' tendency to trap heat , which can be deadly – especially for the elderly – during heat waves .
the roofs also provide an opportunity for flora and fauna to find room to survive in cities .
according to the berlin-based igra , green roofs especially promote biodiversity , providing shelter and food for bees , butterflies and beetles .
car park owner ernst hagemann is pleased with the little creatures his green roof has attracted , despite its location just off a busy dusseldorf street .
" there are many insects and birds here that were long gone from the city .
i 've seen a wren , chaffinches , greenfinches – all kinds of birds , " he said .
the benefits of green roofs do n't stop here though , according to igra .
they can also enhance the quality of life for city slickers by reducing noise levels , and can reduce flooding and damage to sewer systems because they reduce water run-off by 50-90 percent during storms .
productivity gains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green roofs offer employees a place to a take a break green roofs are also catching on in the corporate world a means of improving productivity .
" it 's very important that employees have green areas where they can take a break … important studies about this have been conducted in germany , " said christian schulze-ardey from the bonn-based landscape research , development & construction society , which publishes technical guidelines for green roofs and buildings .
" for example , bmw put a lot of green structure in its offices and the result was a very low rate of illness .
i think that 's a sign of the importance of green structures and green roofing , " he said .
schulze-ardey also believes german expertise in green roofing is highly prized overseas , because of the country 's decades-long experience in engineering the structures . " we often have demand from people in america to buy our guidelines , " he said , adding that green roofs had an even more important role to play in the us where cities are much large than in germany .
in the meantime , green roof leader dusseldorf is n't resting on its laurels .
the city introduced a new incentive this year – a reduced sewage charge for buildings with green roofs .
the city is also conducting research to see just how much of an impact green roofs have in curbing temperatures and cutting run-off . author : laura schweiger editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a plight that affects thousands of immigrants in germany . in multicultural berlin , it 's not unusual to find immigrant children and teens who are struggling with integration issues – despite having all the documents they need to live legally in germany .
but for lial , hassan , and maradona akkouch , it 's a different story .
the siblings have lived in berlin for as long as they can remember , but every day , they fear their family could be deported back to their native lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film won a prize at this year 's berlinale now , a documentary about the siblings ' lives has hit german movie screens .
filmmakers agostino imondi and dietmar ratsch of indi film followed the teenagers over a period of several years , documenting all aspects of their lives : at home with their mother , at school or vocational training , at the immigration office , and at the clubs where they give free rein to their passion for rap , hip hop , and street dance .
the result is a film which has earned critical acclaim , including from the jury of this year 's berlinale , where " neukoelln unlimited " won the crystal bear for best film in the category generation14plus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmmakers imondi -lrb- left -rrb- and ratsch followed the family for years the film had its national cinema release on april 8 , meaning that a wider audience can now delve into a world that most germans do n't know exists .
neukoelln is berlin 's most multi-ethnic neighborhood , home to the akkouch family and others who , like them , never manage to feel truly at home .
that 's because , despite moving here almost 20 years ago , the members of the akkouch family have never been granted residency permits .
instead , they have what 's called " exceptional leave to remain . "
they can be deported any time at short notice , and their movements are very limited .
maradona , who is now 16 , laughs bitterly when asked how his residency status impacts his life .
" my status is basically a piece of paper that folds in three , with a red line through it , and because of this piece of paper , i 'm not allowed to travel outside the city of berlin .
i ca n't open a bank account , get a driver 's license , and i 'm not allowed to work - nothing , " he says on the sidelines of the " neukoelln unlimited " premiere .
" a modern cinderella story " maradona is perhaps the film 's most engaging - and most frustrating - character .
he has talent and charisma in spades , and yet he hangs out with a bad crowd , has run-ins with the police , and is frequently suspended from school .
his older brother , hassan , 20 , says maradona 's attitude toward life in germany suffered from the time in 2003 , when the family was woken up by police and told to pack their things .
they were sent back to lebanon the same day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hassan 's rap songs tell his story " the moment the plane took off , it was suddenly clear to me that life is not a game , " hassan says in the film , thinking back to the deportation .
" i think everyone has a moment like that , when they realize that they 're not a kid anymore .
the deportation marked the end of my childhood . "
for the akkouch family , lebanon no longer felt like home .
eventually , they returned to neukoelln , but they are in constant contact with the local immigration authorities , and that has an impact on their lives .
the film shows how hassan constantly needs to update his residency permit in order to pursue a high school diploma .
the family also has to prove that they can look after themselves financially , which makes the siblings even more determined to make money from singing and dancing .
their persistence is what attracted filmmaker imondi to the project .
" what interested me is that it 's the story of a family that does n't give up ; it 's really a modern cinderella story for me , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are a family that , despite all the difficulties , all the walls they encounter , is able to break through these walls as they fight for their right to be here . "
lial , 21 , is hopeful that the film 's release might change things for her family .

it 's a plight that affects thousands of immigrants in germany . in multicultural berlin , it 's not unusual to find immigrant children and teens who are struggling with integration issues – despite having all the documents they need to live legally in germany .
but for lial , hassan , and maradona akkouch , it 's a different story .
the siblings have lived in berlin for as long as they can remember , but every day , they fear their family could be deported back to their native lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film won a prize at this year 's berlinale now , a documentary about the siblings ' lives has hit german movie screens .
filmmakers agostino imondi and dietmar ratsch of indi film followed the teenagers over a period of several years , documenting all aspects of their lives : at home with their mother , at school or vocational training , at the immigration office , and at the clubs where they give free rein to their passion for rap , hip hop , and street dance .
the result is a film which has earned critical acclaim , including from the jury of this year 's berlinale , where " neukoelln unlimited " won the crystal bear for best film in the category generation14plus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmmakers imondi -lrb- left -rrb- and ratsch followed the family for years the film had its national cinema release on april 8 , meaning that a wider audience can now delve into a world that most germans do n't know exists .
neukoelln is berlin 's most multi-ethnic neighborhood , home to the akkouch family and others who , like them , never manage to feel truly at home .
that 's because , despite moving here almost 20 years ago , the members of the akkouch family have never been granted residency permits .
instead , they have what 's called " exceptional leave to remain . "
they can be deported any time at short notice , and their movements are very limited .
maradona , who is now 16 , laughs bitterly when asked how his residency status impacts his life .
" my status is basically a piece of paper that folds in three , with a red line through it , and because of this piece of paper , i 'm not allowed to travel outside the city of berlin .
i ca n't open a bank account , get a driver 's license , and i 'm not allowed to work - nothing , " he says on the sidelines of the " neukoelln unlimited " premiere .
" a modern cinderella story " maradona is perhaps the film 's most engaging - and most frustrating - character .
he has talent and charisma in spades , and yet he hangs out with a bad crowd , has run-ins with the police , and is frequently suspended from school .
his older brother , hassan , 20 , says maradona 's attitude toward life in germany suffered from the time in 2003 , when the family was woken up by police and told to pack their things .
they were sent back to lebanon the same day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hassan 's rap songs tell his story " the moment the plane took off , it was suddenly clear to me that life is not a game , " hassan says in the film , thinking back to the deportation .
" i think everyone has a moment like that , when they realize that they 're not a kid anymore .
the deportation marked the end of my childhood . "
for the akkouch family , lebanon no longer felt like home .
eventually , they returned to neukoelln , but they are in constant contact with the local immigration authorities , and that has an impact on their lives .
the film shows how hassan constantly needs to update his residency permit in order to pursue a high school diploma .
the family also has to prove that they can look after themselves financially , which makes the siblings even more determined to make money from singing and dancing .
their persistence is what attracted filmmaker imondi to the project .
" what interested me is that it 's the story of a family that does n't give up ; it 's really a modern cinderella story for me , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are a family that , despite all the difficulties , all the walls they encounter , is able to break through these walls as they fight for their right to be here . "
lial , 21 , is hopeful that the film 's release might change things for her family .
both she and hassan have now been granted residency permits , as they are both of legal age .
but her mother and her younger siblings are still in germany on exceptional leave .
if they were to be deported , her family would be split up .
after fighting for so long to remain in neukoelln together , that 's a prospect none of them wants to face .

" a program must be agreed on between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and greece " before any concrete financial aid can be offered by the european union , merkel said .
berlin 's stance was criticized by italian foreign minister franco frattini , who said he was " concerned by the intransigence " germany was showing .
" this is not a rescue operation .
this is a consolidation of europe 's walls ; the walls of the euro .
it 's a rescue for all of us , " frattini said .
deftly sidestepping the words " bailout " or " default " , merkel did , however , emphasize that -lrb- eu -rrb- government guarantees were " indispensable " to ensure that a greek austerity program effectively tackled the country 's massive deficit .
but , despite her attempts to reassure financial markets , investors on monday battered greek bonds , sending the yield , or borrowing rate , on benchmark 10-year government bonds soaring to 9.4 percent .
euro exit ' not an option ' for greece chancellor merkel said it was up to greece to convince the world that it had a " credible " debt-reduction plan and that germany was prepared when that became evident .
she said she had " confidence " in the negotiations greece was conducting with the imf and the european union .
she stressed that expelling greece from the euro currency zone was " not an option " , warning that such talk only fueled uncertainty in the marketplace .
" what we need is a quick reaction for the stability of the eurozone as a whole and everything that takes us away from this central goal is , at the moment , not an option .

" the president 's life cut tragically short , and the death of poland 's patriotic elite , means one thing to us : we must complete their mission , " jaroslaw kaczynski said in a statement announcing his candidacy .
" we owe this to them ; we owe this to our nation , " he said .
jaroslaw , the elder twin by 45 minutes , heads the opposition right-wing law and justice party and served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 .
he lost that job to donald tusk of the civic platform , who is currently prime minister , in snap elections in november 2007 .
kaczynski said he 'd decided to campaign for the presidential job because poland was a shared responsibility that " demands overcoming personal suffering . "
public mood hard to predict in a recently published poll that had assumed jaroslaw kaczynski would run for president , he received about 26 percent support from those surveyed .
poland 's acting president , bronislaw komorowski , led the poll with nearly 50 percent support as the candidate for the governing , center-right civic platform .
but the public mood is difficult to gauge after the fatal plane accident , which wiped out much of poland 's military and political elite .
" this is not a normal election , " said krzysztof bobinski , director of the warsaw think-tank , unia and polska foundation .
" in reality , it wo n't be him -lrb- jaroslaw -rrb- running , it will be his brother .
his campaign will play on sympathy for his brother . "

" a program must be agreed on between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and greece " before any concrete financial aid can be offered by the european union , merkel said .
berlin 's stance was criticized by italian foreign minister franco frattini , who said he was " concerned by the intransigence " germany was showing .
" this is not a rescue operation .
this is a consolidation of europe 's walls ; the walls of the euro .
it 's a rescue for all of us , " frattini said .
deftly sidestepping the words " bailout " or " default " , merkel did , however , emphasize that -lrb- eu -rrb- government guarantees were " indispensable " to ensure that a greek austerity program effectively tackled the country 's massive deficit .
but , despite her attempts to reassure financial markets , investors on monday battered greek bonds , sending the yield , or borrowing rate , on benchmark 10-year government bonds soaring to 9.4 percent .
euro exit ' not an option ' for greece chancellor merkel said it was up to greece to convince the world that it had a " credible " debt-reduction plan and that germany was prepared when that became evident .
she said she had " confidence " in the negotiations greece was conducting with the imf and the european union .
she stressed that expelling greece from the euro currency zone was " not an option " , warning that such talk only fueled uncertainty in the marketplace .
" what we need is a quick reaction for the stability of the eurozone as a whole and everything that takes us away from this central goal is , at the moment , not an option .
we do not need uncertainty , but certainty , " merkel said .
the chancellor predicted that it would be only a " matter of days " before a rescue package for greece was nailed down. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , after only nine months , he 's been given the pink slip , as the club tries to salvage its season .
but there 's little left to salvage . hamburg 's board of directors announced labbadia would be leaving the club involuntarily on monday , one day after the team suffered a disastrous 5-1 loss to hoffenheim in the bundesliga and three days before a crucial away tie to fulham in the europa league semi-finals .
" we can not and did not want to continue in this formation , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told reporters after meeting with labbadia .
" we found we could n't expect to win against fulham .
it was the last point at which we could act so as not to endanger our season goal of qualifying for europe . "
but hamburg 's chances are already in grave danger .
in seventh place in the table , and five points behind sixth-placed stuttgart , hamburg 's prospects of qualifying via the league are slim-to-none .
hamburg 's best bet is to win the europa cup outright .
but their desultory nil-nil draw in their home tie against fulham last week hardly put them in an ideal position to do that .
" labbadia is a dead issue , " a representative of the hamburg board declared tersely to reporters earlier on monday .
and it all started so well bildunterschrift : it 's been a painful 2010 for the northern german side this was supposed to be hamburg 's year .
after a few seasons of relative austerity , hofmann loosened the purse strings this summer , bringing in highly coveted young talents eljero elia and marcus berg , veteran midfielder ze roberto and labbadia , whose move from leverkusen is reported to have cost 1.3 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- .
many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .
hamburg were fourth over the winter break , and when hofmann brought in veteran star ruud van nistelrooy in january to bolster an injury-prone attack , many people considered the northern germans a dark-horse candidate for the title .
ca n't we all just get along ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero is just one player who 's lost his orientation but little , if anything , has gone right in 2010 for hamburg .
since the break , the team has managed only four wins in 15 matches , forgetting how to score goals in the process .
part of that was due to injuries .
ze roberto , and hamburg 's most reliable striker mladen petric , missed significant action this year , and elia , who looked like a winner , is out for the rest of the season .
but disciplinary problems and internal rancor have been equally , if not more , significant in hamburg 's tumble .
peruvian striker paolo guerrero went awol for weeks , claiming he was too afraid of flying to return from his home country , where he was recovering from a knee injury .
and when he did finally arrive in hamburg , he promptly got himself suspended for the rest of the season for throwing a water bottle at a fan - critics said it was the best aim he 'd displayed in months .
moreover , both van nistelrooy and team captain and goalkeeper frank rost publicly criticized labbadia , with the dutch striker questioning the coach 's ability to communicate tactics .
technique coach ricardo moniz now takes over on an interim basis , as hamburg attempt to put the pieces back together .
his first assignment is in fulham on thursday .

and it all started so well bildunterschrift : it 's been a painful 2010 for the northern german side this was supposed to be hamburg 's year .
after a few seasons of relative austerity , hofmann loosened the purse strings this summer , bringing in highly coveted young talents eljero elia and marcus berg , veteran midfielder ze roberto and labbadia , whose move from leverkusen is reported to have cost 1.3 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- .
many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .
hamburg were fourth over the winter break , and when hofmann brought in veteran star ruud van nistelrooy in january to bolster an injury-prone attack , many people considered the northern germans a dark-horse candidate for the title .

since the break , the team has managed only four wins in 15 matches , forgetting how to score goals in the process .
part of that was due to injuries .
ze roberto , and hamburg 's most reliable striker mladen petric , missed significant action this year , and elia , who looked like a winner , is out for the rest of the season .
but disciplinary problems and internal rancor have been equally , if not more , significant in hamburg 's tumble .
peruvian striker paolo guerrero went awol for weeks , claiming he was too afraid of flying to return from his home country , where he was recovering from a knee injury .
and when he did finally arrive in hamburg , he promptly got himself suspended for the rest of the season for throwing a water bottle at a fan - critics said it was the best aim he 'd displayed in months .
moreover , both van nistelrooy and team captain and goalkeeper frank rost publicly criticized labbadia , with the dutch striker questioning the coach 's ability to communicate tactics .
technique coach ricardo moniz now takes over on an interim basis , as hamburg attempt to put the pieces back together .

lalit modi is accused of corruption and tax evasion .
he denies the allegations . just hours after the final match of ipl season three on sunday , the indian cricket authorities announced that lalit modi , the chairman and the commissioner of the ipl had been stripped of all his posts .
shashank manohar , the president of the board of control for cricket in india , which owns ipl , told media that the " suspension was necessary for a free and fair inquiry " .

corruption allegations modi , who has been a driving force behind the multi million dollar ipl tournament , is accused of a wide range of corruption allegations .
these include offering bribes , tax evasion , match fixing and irregularities in bidding deals related to the ipl .
according to local media , modi is also accused of receiving an 80 million dollar kickback when he negotiated television broadcast rights for the cricket series .
the ipl 's governing council has given lalit modi 15 days to explain why " disciplinary action should not be taken against him " .
the board also said that if modi 's reply was convincing , charges and proceedings against him would be dropped .
modi remains defiant 46-year-old modi has denied any wrong doing .
in a speech following the final match late last sunday , he insisted the " ipl was clean and transparent " .
" i reassure you that if there has been any flouting of the rules and regulations or if there have been any irregularities , i shall take full responsibility , " modi added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipl was established in 2008 the controversy started two weeks ago , when modi revealed the ownership details of a new franchise set to join the ipl in 2011 .

the news sparked media frenzy and protest from the opposition , which ultimately forced the minister to step down .
since then , the finance ministry has launched an extensive tax investigation into the ipl , the cricket board and its franchise owners , which include powerful business people and bollywood stars. du / afp / dpa / reuters / pti editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , after only nine months , he 's been given the pink slip , as the club tries to salvage its season .
but there 's little left to salvage . hamburg 's board of directors announced labbadia would be leaving the club involuntarily on monday , one day after the team suffered a disastrous 5-1 loss to hoffenheim in the bundesliga and three days before a crucial away tie to fulham in the europa league semi-finals .
" we can not and did not want to continue in this formation , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told reporters after meeting with labbadia .
" we found we could n't expect to win against fulham .
it was the last point at which we could act so as not to endanger our season goal of qualifying for europe . "
but hamburg 's chances are already in grave danger .
in seventh place in the table , and five points behind sixth-placed stuttgart , hamburg 's prospects of qualifying via the league are slim-to-none .
hamburg 's best bet is to win the europa cup outright .
but their desultory nil-nil draw in their home tie against fulham last week hardly put them in an ideal position to do that .

many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .

many questions are being asked by politicians , the airlines and scientists about a phenomenon that could occur at any time and , according to past trends , could be even more severe .
airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by volcanoes .
jet engines can suck in volcanic ash , which melts in the intense heat . the turbine blades are then coated and can clog up and fail .
it has the makings of a potential catastrophe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1.2 million passengers per day were affected so when the huge cloud of ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano drifted into british airspace , the uk 's air industry regulator banned all commercial flights .
more than a dozen other countries - including germany and france - followed that example , closing their airspace either partially or fully .
" volcanic ash and jet engines do n't mix , so safety is our number one priority , " said bob jones , the uk regulator 's head of operations .
" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .
" where you have a small chance of that happening , it would be very wrong to say , let 's give it a try .
this is a matter of life and death . "
but as the flight ban dragged on , it quickly became more a matter of life and death for the airlines , which were losing about 150 million euros a day .
some were in danger of going under financially and they began to complain that the authorities had overreacted . incomplete analysis british weather forecasters used a computer program to predict where the wind would carry the ash cloud and how quickly it would disperse .
the program was first developed after the nuclear reactor accident at chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you balance economic fallout for airlines against passenger safety ?
britain 's met office says it is tried and tested .
but giovanni bisignani , head of the international air transport association , is angry that a great swathe of northern european airspace was closed purely on the basis of computer modeling .
" i call it a european mess because we did not focus on figures and facts .
europe was using a theoretical , mathematical approach .
that is not what we need , " he said .
" we need test flights to go into the atmosphere , assess the ashes and then take decisions . " in fact , it has emerged that the met office could not establish a complete picture of the cloud over britain until almost a week into the crisis because its specialist monitoring jet was out of action .
the bae 146 was the only plane equipped with state-of-the-art measuring instruments that could map the full extent of the ash .
yet by the fourth day of the shutdown , european airlines like lufthansa , klm and british airways had flown a number of their own test flights . they all reported no damage to their jet engines . peter sammonds , a volcanologist at university college , london , said this underlines the fact that it is not enough to rely solely on weather simulations . " that sort of initial monitoring of the volcano , the modeling by the met office , probably needs to be backed up with more intensive atmospheric sampling to try and map the distribution of the ash in the atmosphere somewhat more accurately to provide better input into what the next decision should be , " he said . low concentration test flights by research aircraft revealed interesting data .
the ash cloud contained basalt , not the more damaging substance andesite .
the ash concentration was also extremely low - no more than 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air .
jet engine manufacturers said the cloud would need to be about 20 times denser to damage turbine blades .
after six days , all european airspace was officially judged to be safe and all remaining flight restrictions were lifted .
it is estimated that the airlines lost more than a billion euros due to the shutdown .
european air traffic authorities admit they have been on a steep learning curve and now have a more flexible approach to volcanic ash .
just a preview just as well , according to iceland 's president olafur grimsson . more ash could be on the way - much more , in fact , when iceland 's giant katla volcano erupts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines have been vocal in their criticism of the blanket airspace closure " what we have seen now is in fact a small rehearsal of what would happen when katla will erupt , " he said .
" so i think it is high time for european governments and airline authorities all over europe and the world to start planning for it . "
katla erupts roughly once every one hundred years and the last time it lost its top was in 1918 .
siim kallas , the eu 's transport commissioner , has said he will begin working this week with colleagues to lay out a road map for similar events .
the list of questions he faces is daunting , ranging from determining the safety threshold for different engines , weighing potential danger against economic fallout and balancing passenger rights against the industry 's health .
" we needed a fast , coordinated european response to a crisis , " he told reporters .
" instead , we had a fragmented patchwork of 27 national airspaces .
we need a single european regulator for a single european sky . "
kallas has said he will propose speeding up the plan to unify control over all european skyways .

many questions are being asked by politicians , the airlines and scientists about a phenomenon that could occur at any time and , according to past trends , could be even more severe .
airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by volcanoes .
jet engines can suck in volcanic ash , which melts in the intense heat . the turbine blades are then coated and can clog up and fail .
it has the makings of a potential catastrophe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1.2 million passengers per day were affected so when the huge cloud of ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano drifted into british airspace , the uk 's air industry regulator banned all commercial flights .
more than a dozen other countries - including germany and france - followed that example , closing their airspace either partially or fully .
" volcanic ash and jet engines do n't mix , so safety is our number one priority , " said bob jones , the uk regulator 's head of operations .
" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .
" where you have a small chance of that happening , it would be very wrong to say , let 's give it a try .
this is a matter of life and death . "
but as the flight ban dragged on , it quickly became more a matter of life and death for the airlines , which were losing about 150 million euros a day .
some were in danger of going under financially and they began to complain that the authorities had overreacted . incomplete analysis british weather forecasters used a computer program to predict where the wind would carry the ash cloud and how quickly it would disperse .
the program was first developed after the nuclear reactor accident at chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you balance economic fallout for airlines against passenger safety ?
britain 's met office says it is tried and tested .
but giovanni bisignani , head of the international air transport association , is angry that a great swathe of northern european airspace was closed purely on the basis of computer modeling .
" i call it a european mess because we did not focus on figures and facts .
europe was using a theoretical , mathematical approach .
that is not what we need , " he said .
" we need test flights to go into the atmosphere , assess the ashes and then take decisions . " in fact , it has emerged that the met office could not establish a complete picture of the cloud over britain until almost a week into the crisis because its specialist monitoring jet was out of action .
the bae 146 was the only plane equipped with state-of-the-art measuring instruments that could map the full extent of the ash .
yet by the fourth day of the shutdown , european airlines like lufthansa , klm and british airways had flown a number of their own test flights . they all reported no damage to their jet engines . peter sammonds , a volcanologist at university college , london , said this underlines the fact that it is not enough to rely solely on weather simulations . " that sort of initial monitoring of the volcano , the modeling by the met office , probably needs to be backed up with more intensive atmospheric sampling to try and map the distribution of the ash in the atmosphere somewhat more accurately to provide better input into what the next decision should be , " he said . low concentration test flights by research aircraft revealed interesting data .
the ash cloud contained basalt , not the more damaging substance andesite .
the ash concentration was also extremely low - no more than 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air .
jet engine manufacturers said the cloud would need to be about 20 times denser to damage turbine blades .
after six days , all european airspace was officially judged to be safe and all remaining flight restrictions were lifted .
it is estimated that the airlines lost more than a billion euros due to the shutdown .
european air traffic authorities admit they have been on a steep learning curve and now have a more flexible approach to volcanic ash .
just a preview just as well , according to iceland 's president olafur grimsson . more ash could be on the way - much more , in fact , when iceland 's giant katla volcano erupts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines have been vocal in their criticism of the blanket airspace closure " what we have seen now is in fact a small rehearsal of what would happen when katla will erupt , " he said .
" so i think it is high time for european governments and airline authorities all over europe and the world to start planning for it . "
katla erupts roughly once every one hundred years and the last time it lost its top was in 1918 .
siim kallas , the eu 's transport commissioner , has said he will begin working this week with colleagues to lay out a road map for similar events .
the list of questions he faces is daunting , ranging from determining the safety threshold for different engines , weighing potential danger against economic fallout and balancing passenger rights against the industry 's health .
" we needed a fast , coordinated european response to a crisis , " he told reporters .
" instead , we had a fragmented patchwork of 27 national airspaces .
we need a single european regulator for a single european sky . "
kallas has said he will propose speeding up the plan to unify control over all european skyways .

" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .
" where you have a small chance of that happening , it would be very wrong to say , let 's give it a try .
this is a matter of life and death . "
but as the flight ban dragged on , it quickly became more a matter of life and death for the airlines , which were losing about 150 million euros a day .
some were in danger of going under financially and they began to complain that the authorities had overreacted . incomplete analysis british weather forecasters used a computer program to predict where the wind would carry the ash cloud and how quickly it would disperse .
the program was first developed after the nuclear reactor accident at chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you balance economic fallout for airlines against passenger safety ?
britain 's met office says it is tried and tested .
but giovanni bisignani , head of the international air transport association , is angry that a great swathe of northern european airspace was closed purely on the basis of computer modeling .
" i call it a european mess because we did not focus on figures and facts .
europe was using a theoretical , mathematical approach .
that is not what we need , " he said .
" we need test flights to go into the atmosphere , assess the ashes and then take decisions . " in fact , it has emerged that the met office could not establish a complete picture of the cloud over britain until almost a week into the crisis because its specialist monitoring jet was out of action .
the bae 146 was the only plane equipped with state-of-the-art measuring instruments that could map the full extent of the ash .
yet by the fourth day of the shutdown , european airlines like lufthansa , klm and british airways had flown a number of their own test flights . they all reported no damage to their jet engines . peter sammonds , a volcanologist at university college , london , said this underlines the fact that it is not enough to rely solely on weather simulations . " that sort of initial monitoring of the volcano , the modeling by the met office , probably needs to be backed up with more intensive atmospheric sampling to try and map the distribution of the ash in the atmosphere somewhat more accurately to provide better input into what the next decision should be , " he said . low concentration test flights by research aircraft revealed interesting data .
the ash cloud contained basalt , not the more damaging substance andesite .
the ash concentration was also extremely low - no more than 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air .
jet engine manufacturers said the cloud would need to be about 20 times denser to damage turbine blades .
after six days , all european airspace was officially judged to be safe and all remaining flight restrictions were lifted .
it is estimated that the airlines lost more than a billion euros due to the shutdown .
european air traffic authorities admit they have been on a steep learning curve and now have a more flexible approach to volcanic ash .
just a preview just as well , according to iceland 's president olafur grimsson . more ash could be on the way - much more , in fact , when iceland 's giant katla volcano erupts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines have been vocal in their criticism of the blanket airspace closure " what we have seen now is in fact a small rehearsal of what would happen when katla will erupt , " he said .
" so i think it is high time for european governments and airline authorities all over europe and the world to start planning for it . "
katla erupts roughly once every one hundred years and the last time it lost its top was in 1918 .
siim kallas , the eu 's transport commissioner , has said he will begin working this week with colleagues to lay out a road map for similar events .
the list of questions he faces is daunting , ranging from determining the safety threshold for different engines , weighing potential danger against economic fallout and balancing passenger rights against the industry 's health .
" we needed a fast , coordinated european response to a crisis , " he told reporters .
" instead , we had a fragmented patchwork of 27 national airspaces .
we need a single european regulator for a single european sky . "
kallas has said he will propose speeding up the plan to unify control over all european skyways .

and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .
back in black bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli fans are a colorful , fun-loving bunch if lautern are one of the bundesliga 's most storied teams , st. pauli are without doubt the hippest .
the club has only spent a total of five years in the first division and its greatest success was beating the then world club champions bayern munich , but results are not the source of its appeal .
the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .

and another popular team , st. pauli , is also poised to rise back up to the top flight . it took two days for the frowns to turn into smiles .
kaiserslautern failed to secure promotion on friday against lowly rostock , but the deal was done on sunday when third-placed augsburg only drew .
there was a touch of the inevitable about the four-time german champions going back to the top flight - they 've led the second division since the seventh round of play .
one of the team 's biggest fan clubs celebrated promotion by publishing an " open letter to the second division . "
" you taught us one thing : be yourself , " wrote the authors .
" we need team performances .
players who hang out together and are friends off the pitch , who do n't look down on fans and can collectively up their games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli could join lautern in division one augburg 's draw also assured second-placed st. pauli of at least a spot in the play-off against the team finishing third from bottom in the first division .
and the hamburg side need just a single victory in their final two matches to secure direct promotion .
if pauli do go up , the first division will welcome the return of two sides that many fans feel are an intrinsic part of the bundesliga - albeit for very different reasons .
rise and fall and rise kaiserslautern were one of the original teams in the nationwide bundesliga , which was formed in 1963 and despite their travails in recent years , they remain the eighth most successful team of all time in german football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehhagel worked wonders at lautern before taking the greece job their history could not be more unusual .
after 32 straight seasons in the first division , the " red devils " or " the indestructibles , " as they are known , were relegated , only to get promoted the following season and go on to win the first division the year after that .
the architect of that unique triumph was coach otto rehhagel , who would go on to perform a similar miracle by leading greece to the european championship in 2004 .
lautern 's 1997-8 squad included a host of familiar names , from goal-getter olaf marschall , defender and world cup hero andy brehme to a very , very young michael ballack .
but in subsequent years , the team overspent on washed-up stars in an attempt to stay at the top and were hit by an internal financing scandal .
lautern were relegated in 2006 , after a draw against wolfsburg on the final day of the season - in a match , in which they had jumped out to an early lead .
many fans openly wept , suspecting that the cash-strapped club was unlikely to pull off another quick rise to the top flight - and they were right .
true-blue reds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red devils have been nearly unstoppable this season kaiserslautern fans proved exceedingly loyal despite the squad 's downward spiral .
in fact , the club gained more than a thousand new members in the months after its second relegation .
and they remained true , even as the once-proud red devils drifted into second division mediocrity and even flirted with relegation into division three .
that 's in part because the city , with around 100,000 inhabitants , is one of the smallest places in germany with a major football club .
ask ten germans what pops to mind when they hear the word kaiserslautern , and nine will probably say the soccer team .
lautern has consistently produced big stars - mario basler and miroslav klose , to name just two - but has rarely had the financial muscle to keep them .
this season 's success , conversely , has been built on players discarded by bigger clubs .
leading goalscorer erik jendrisek is a cast-off from hanover , midfielder ace sidney sam came on loan from hamburg , and defender rodnei was borrowed from hertha berlin .
whether those players will stay in lautern , and if so , whether they will thrive in the top flight , are open questions .
but for now no one is asking them .
it 's enough that the red devils are back where their supporters , and many german football fans , feel they belong .
back in black bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pauli fans are a colorful , fun-loving bunch if lautern are one of the bundesliga 's most storied teams , st. pauli are without doubt the hippest .
the club has only spent a total of five years in the first division and its greatest success was beating the then world club champions bayern munich , but results are not the source of its appeal .
the st.pauli district of hamburg is also home to the city ’ s red-light district and the main bar and club areas .
the millerntor stadium , where the club plays , looks more like an air-raid bunker than a sporting arena , and the team takes to the field for its home games to the strains of ac / dc 's hell 's bells .
it 's not uncommon to see people in st. pauli t-shirts in cities hundreds of kilometers away from hamburg , although the hardcore fans hail from that port city , where many consider " pauli " to be the more genuine and entertaining alternative to the city 's other , bigger club .
the club is celebrating its centenary this year - as the official website puts it , they 've been " non-established since 1910 . "
st. pauli 's rise this season is down in part to striker marius ebbers , a 32-year-old journeyman who 's popped in 18 goals , earning him the nickname " messi " among pauli 's wryly hysterical supporters .
and the team has definitely been fun to watch in recent months .
with 67 goals scored , they 've had by far and away the second division 's most potent offense .
pauli fans know there 's still a bit of work left to done to get promoted .
and even if the team does go up , no one 's under any illusions that a team with limited financial means and a stadium that holds less than 20 thousand will find life easy in the top flight .
but one thing is guaranteed .
whatever happens , pauli fans will do what they do best : party .
and if they can be partying alongside kaiserslautern in the bundesliga 's first division , then all the better .

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .

" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

belgium 's center-right government collapsed on monday , four days after the prime minister tendered his resignation in a dispute between french and flemish speakers over language and political rights . belgium 's king albert ii has accepted the resignation of prime minister yves leterme 's coalition government amidst feuding between flemish and french speakers over the apportionment of a bilingual brussels electoral district .
it is the third time in as many years that leterme offered to step down when faced by intractable disputes .

belgium 's constitutional court ruled in 2003 that the so-called bhv district , the only bilingual constituency in the country , would have to be reapportioned .
since then , belgian leaders have remained at loggerheads over flemish demands to make parts of the district monolingual and francophone calls to allow voters throughout the district to support french-speaking political parties .

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

his goal is to get a foot in the door for german business ahead of the 2014 football world cup and 2016 olympics to be hosted by the emerging economic powerhouse .
but it is not only a mutual love of football that bruederle will be using to bridge the divide between the two countries .
brazilians have also taken to heart , and stomach , the german art of brewing beer .
the setting is a modestly sized city called blumenau , which most would assume lies somewhere near the black forest or perhaps along one of germany 's many rivers .
however this city can not be found in germany , or anywhere on the european continent .
it lies in the south of brazil and has become home to what it claims is the world 's second-largest beer festival after oktoberfest in munich .
the city was founded by germans around 160 years ago and is now home to hundreds of thousands of their descendents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenau is a home away from home for germans the city hosts a collection of small breweries that have carried on the world-renowned tradition of german beer-making under the labels " eisenbahn , " " schornstein , " and simply " das bier . "
lasting legacy master brewer claudio jose gonzales de matos says brazilians have taken up beer making and drinking with as much passion as the germans who brought their special recipes to the country so long ago .
" we live here in a tropical country and year after year , beer consumption has continued to rise substantially .
in particular , small breweries here in brazil are growing very fast , " he says .
" they have revived the traditional brewing techniques and distanced themselves from the more modern industrial-style methods .
today , there are many small breweries in brazil producing beer of high quality . "
every year , brazilians consume around 10 billion liters of beer - just one billion short of germans - and the south american country now represents the fourth-largest beer market in the world .
mass produced , mainstream beer labels still dominate in brazil , but small breweries are staging a comeback , and have trebled their market share to six percent in recent years .
bildunterschrift : brazilians are warming to beer culture solid foundation brewer pedro paulo moretzohn , who spent many years perfecting his brewing techniques in europe , believes that german beer-making methods are underpinning the fight back of micro-breweries in brazil .
" these new enterprises sprang mainly from german culture in cities like blumenau and others nearby , " he says .
" but also because people want beers with a variety of tastes .
here our beers are virtually without additives - nothing other than grain varieties such as malt , hops and wheat .
that gives these beers a very special characteristic . "
behind the boom are more than 100 micro-breweries producing " cervejas artesanais , " or hand-crafted beers , with varieties including yeast beers , dark beers and even koelsch-style beers popular in the areas surrounding the western german city of cologne .
despite the quality beer offered by micro-breweries , a mass-produced , light , watery version of a pilsner still dominates the brazilian market .
but brewing instructor ligia marcondes believes the market for high-quality beer is continuously growing in the country of nearly 190 million , especially among the middle class .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still enjoy their beer more than brazilians " for example , today i can say that i love hoppy beers , whereas earlier , i might have thought those beers were too bitter , " she says .
" at the moment i like wheat beer , but of course , i 'll still try new beers .
i like full-bodied beers .
bitter beers , too .
so you could say i have changed my consumption habits a little . "
raising the bar so successful have some micro-breweries been that they 've forced some larger brazilian breweries to rethink their beer-making ethos , leading to an improvement in the quality of some mass-produced labels .
brewing specialist cilene saorin says what is needed is a shift in paradigm by both beer makers and consumers .
" we need to work on our drinking culture and improve knowledge of beer culture , " she says .
" we have to explain that pilsner is not the only beer , but that there are over 100 different varieties and that different beers suit different occasions .
this process of education will take time " .
" we 've already made a lot of progress over the last five years .
give us another five years and you 'll see that the market will have evolved . "

his goal is to get a foot in the door for german business ahead of the 2014 football world cup and 2016 olympics to be hosted by the emerging economic powerhouse .
but it is not only a mutual love of football that bruederle will be using to bridge the divide between the two countries .
brazilians have also taken to heart , and stomach , the german art of brewing beer .
the setting is a modestly sized city called blumenau , which most would assume lies somewhere near the black forest or perhaps along one of germany 's many rivers .
however this city can not be found in germany , or anywhere on the european continent .
it lies in the south of brazil and has become home to what it claims is the world 's second-largest beer festival after oktoberfest in munich .
the city was founded by germans around 160 years ago and is now home to hundreds of thousands of their descendents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumenau is a home away from home for germans the city hosts a collection of small breweries that have carried on the world-renowned tradition of german beer-making under the labels " eisenbahn , " " schornstein , " and simply " das bier . "
lasting legacy master brewer claudio jose gonzales de matos says brazilians have taken up beer making and drinking with as much passion as the germans who brought their special recipes to the country so long ago .
" we live here in a tropical country and year after year , beer consumption has continued to rise substantially .
in particular , small breweries here in brazil are growing very fast , " he says .
" they have revived the traditional brewing techniques and distanced themselves from the more modern industrial-style methods .
today , there are many small breweries in brazil producing beer of high quality . "
every year , brazilians consume around 10 billion liters of beer - just one billion short of germans - and the south american country now represents the fourth-largest beer market in the world .
mass produced , mainstream beer labels still dominate in brazil , but small breweries are staging a comeback , and have trebled their market share to six percent in recent years .
bildunterschrift : brazilians are warming to beer culture solid foundation brewer pedro paulo moretzohn , who spent many years perfecting his brewing techniques in europe , believes that german beer-making methods are underpinning the fight back of micro-breweries in brazil .
" these new enterprises sprang mainly from german culture in cities like blumenau and others nearby , " he says .
" but also because people want beers with a variety of tastes .
here our beers are virtually without additives - nothing other than grain varieties such as malt , hops and wheat .
that gives these beers a very special characteristic . "
behind the boom are more than 100 micro-breweries producing " cervejas artesanais , " or hand-crafted beers , with varieties including yeast beers , dark beers and even koelsch-style beers popular in the areas surrounding the western german city of cologne .
despite the quality beer offered by micro-breweries , a mass-produced , light , watery version of a pilsner still dominates the brazilian market .
but brewing instructor ligia marcondes believes the market for high-quality beer is continuously growing in the country of nearly 190 million , especially among the middle class .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still enjoy their beer more than brazilians " for example , today i can say that i love hoppy beers , whereas earlier , i might have thought those beers were too bitter , " she says .
" at the moment i like wheat beer , but of course , i 'll still try new beers .
i like full-bodied beers .
bitter beers , too .
so you could say i have changed my consumption habits a little . "
raising the bar so successful have some micro-breweries been that they 've forced some larger brazilian breweries to rethink their beer-making ethos , leading to an improvement in the quality of some mass-produced labels .
brewing specialist cilene saorin says what is needed is a shift in paradigm by both beer makers and consumers .
" we need to work on our drinking culture and improve knowledge of beer culture , " she says .
" we have to explain that pilsner is not the only beer , but that there are over 100 different varieties and that different beers suit different occasions .
this process of education will take time " .
" we 've already made a lot of progress over the last five years .
give us another five years and you 'll see that the market will have evolved . "

members of the bishops ’ conference decided that more emphasis should be placed on victims . catholic bishops met in the german city of wuerzburg on monday to discuss draft guidelines on dealing with allegations of sexual abuse more effectively .
" we have reworked the guidelines and made them clearer and more precise , " said the conference representative on abuse , bishop stephan ackermann , referring to recently drafted rules .
the trier bishop said that he was optimistic the next meeting of the bishops ' conference could ratify the guidelines in june .
ackerman worked together with an expert group to draw up the new measures to protect children , which were received by bishops late last week .
he added that the church would not seek to protect priests who broke criminal laws . " it must be clear beyond doubt that we do not claim any legal status separate from civil law , " said ackermann .
victims ' point of view the revised guidelines are intended to address the issue more from the perspective of the victims .
there is also a greater emphasis on prevention of abuse .
ackerman said that the selection and qualification of commissioners who would be responsible for the issue of child abuse had also been addressed .

he added that the church would not seek to protect priests who broke criminal laws . " it must be clear beyond doubt that we do not claim any legal status separate from civil law , " said ackermann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.04.2010 germany 's free democrats risk coalition rift by pushing tax cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle insists his plans for tax cuts make financial sense germany 's free democrats - junior partners in chancellor merkel 's government - have proposed 16 billion euros worth of tax cuts likely to deepen divisions with merkel 's christian democrats . germany 's free democrats are determined to make good on their election promise of wide-reaching tax cuts despite opposition from their coalition partners , chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
at a two-day party convention in the western city of cologne , foreign minister and head of the liberal party , guido westerwelle , proposed 16 billion euros worth of tax cuts per year from 2012 , aimed at supporting those who earn up to 53,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,000 -rrb- .
taking a swipe at german finance minister and christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , who is against tax cuts for budgetary reasons , westerwelle said in cologne : " i can not accept that in this country , as soon as the issue of tax relief is raised , immediately , people say , there 's no money available . "
mounting debt schaeuble , as well as many others in his party , point out that there is no money for generous tax cuts .
germany 's public debt stands at some 73 percent of national income , which has seen schaeuble take on record new borrowing of 80.2 billion euros in the 2010 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's budget has suffered during the recent financial crisis according to a recent poll for public broadcaster zdf , 61 percent of germans agree with schaeuble that the state of germany 's public finances makes tax cuts inappropriate .
but westerwelle insists fair taxation and sound fiscal policies are " two sides of the same coin . "
lower taxes help middle earners and small and medium-sized businesses , creating new jobs that will eventually boost tax revenues , according to the free democrats .
crucial vote the free democrats party convention in cologne comes ahead of crucial elections in north-rhine westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
the vote there is seen as an important test for berlin .
both north-rhine westphalia 's and the federal governments are made up of a coalition of christian and free democrats .

hamburg , which drew 0-0 against english side fulham last thursday in the first leg of the europa league semi-finals , conceded two goals at hoffenheim in the first 11 minutes , both scored by ibisevic .
obasi then took advantage of poor defending , especially for his second goal , where was allowed to go one-on-one with hamburg goalkeeper frank rost in the 73rd minute .
hoffenheim struck again when midfielder sejad salihovic once again punished hamburg 's weak defense to make it 5-1 76 minutes in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 26.04.2010 as dust settles on volcanic ash crisis , a blame game simmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's eyjafjallajokull has calmed , but its bigger sister katla lies in wait the giant plume of ash that recently erupted from an icelandic volcano hurled the airline industry into chaos . now parties are considering what lessons can be learned - because the next eruption is just a matter of time . as the global travel industry slowly returns to normal , a closer look is being taken at the volcanic ash crisis and whether the threat to airplanes merited closing most of europe 's airspace , stranding or delaying a million passengers , and costing the airlines nearly 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- .
many questions are being asked by politicians , the airlines and scientists about a phenomenon that could occur at any time and , according to past trends , could be even more severe .
airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by volcanoes .
jet engines can suck in volcanic ash , which melts in the intense heat . the turbine blades are then coated and can clog up and fail .
it has the makings of a potential catastrophe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1.2 million passengers per day were affected so when the huge cloud of ash from iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano drifted into british airspace , the uk 's air industry regulator banned all commercial flights .
more than a dozen other countries - including germany and france - followed that example , closing their airspace either partially or fully .
" volcanic ash and jet engines do n't mix , so safety is our number one priority , " said bob jones , the uk regulator 's head of operations .
" we wo n't be able to lift those restrictions until we 're comfortable that it 's safe to have aircraft fly with members of the travelling public again . "
while the mayhem negatively affected millions , it has also thrown up a flurry of scientific research .
the silver lining to the ash cloud could be a better understanding of the exact danger of volcanic ash . overreaction ?
the british meteorological office is the volcanic ash advisory centre for the northeastern atlantic .
while the region it monitors is relatively small , it covers some of the busiest airways in the world .
its forecast of where the ash cloud was headed was followed closely by aviation authorities across northern europe .
each day a total of more than 16,000 flights were grounded .
the airlines began to grumble but the international regulations were clear : if there was any volcanic ash in the airspace - any ash at all - no planes should fly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 100,000 flights were cancelled " we 're in a situation where , if the engines were to fail in an aircraft , it is going to crash and everybody on board will die , " said colin brown of the institute of mechanical engineers , who feels the shutdown made sense .
" where you have a small chance of that happening , it would be very wrong to say , let 's give it a try .
this is a matter of life and death . "
but as the flight ban dragged on , it quickly became more a matter of life and death for the airlines , which were losing about 150 million euros a day .
some were in danger of going under financially and they began to complain that the authorities had overreacted . incomplete analysis british weather forecasters used a computer program to predict where the wind would carry the ash cloud and how quickly it would disperse .
the program was first developed after the nuclear reactor accident at chernobyl in 1986 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you balance economic fallout for airlines against passenger safety ?
britain 's met office says it is tried and tested .
but giovanni bisignani , head of the international air transport association , is angry that a great swathe of northern european airspace was closed purely on the basis of computer modeling .
" i call it a european mess because we did not focus on figures and facts .
europe was using a theoretical , mathematical approach .
that is not what we need , " he said .
" we need test flights to go into the atmosphere , assess the ashes and then take decisions . " in fact , it has emerged that the met office could not establish a complete picture of the cloud over britain until almost a week into the crisis because its specialist monitoring jet was out of action .
the bae 146 was the only plane equipped with state-of-the-art measuring instruments that could map the full extent of the ash .
yet by the fourth day of the shutdown , european airlines like lufthansa , klm and british airways had flown a number of their own test flights . they all reported no damage to their jet engines . peter sammonds , a volcanologist at university college , london , said this underlines the fact that it is not enough to rely solely on weather simulations . " that sort of initial monitoring of the volcano , the modeling by the met office , probably needs to be backed up with more intensive atmospheric sampling to try and map the distribution of the ash in the atmosphere somewhat more accurately to provide better input into what the next decision should be , " he said . low concentration test flights by research aircraft revealed interesting data .
the ash cloud contained basalt , not the more damaging substance andesite .
the ash concentration was also extremely low - no more than 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air .
jet engine manufacturers said the cloud would need to be about 20 times denser to damage turbine blades .
after six days , all european airspace was officially judged to be safe and all remaining flight restrictions were lifted .
it is estimated that the airlines lost more than a billion euros due to the shutdown .
european air traffic authorities admit they have been on a steep learning curve and now have a more flexible approach to volcanic ash .
just a preview just as well , according to iceland 's president olafur grimsson . more ash could be on the way - much more , in fact , when iceland 's giant katla volcano erupts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines have been vocal in their criticism of the blanket airspace closure " what we have seen now is in fact a small rehearsal of what would happen when katla will erupt , " he said .
" so i think it is high time for european governments and airline authorities all over europe and the world to start planning for it . "
katla erupts roughly once every one hundred years and the last time it lost its top was in 1918 .
siim kallas , the eu 's transport commissioner , has said he will begin working this week with colleagues to lay out a road map for similar events .
the list of questions he faces is daunting , ranging from determining the safety threshold for different engines , weighing potential danger against economic fallout and balancing passenger rights against the industry 's health .
" we needed a fast , coordinated european response to a crisis , " he told reporters .
" instead , we had a fragmented patchwork of 27 national airspaces .
we need a single european regulator for a single european sky . "
kallas has said he will propose speeding up the plan to unify control over all european skyways .

nationalism is still strong in the balkan state , and liberal pro-western advocates are in the minority .
but recently , that minority has been getting more attention - all because of a twelve-year-old boy named rastko pocesta .
as a young pro-western social activist , pocesta has gained fame through articles he 's published on blogs and facebook , which campaign for serbia to join the european union and nato .
he also supports the independence of kosovo , despite the serbian government 's stance that it is not a separate country .
" serbia should be a country in which human , civil , political and minority rights are maximally respected , " rastko said .
" it should be a country which is not seen through the wars in the 1990 's and the war crimes but by its involvement in international affairs . "
rastko added that serbian membership in the eu would bring economic stability and prosperty .
the young activist also believes nato membership would help improve the security of all serbs .
harsh feedback despite his young age , pocesta is not immune from violent threats made via the internet .
ultranationalists within serbia have begun to take notice of his work and say he 's betrayed serb values .
one post on the forum of a right-wing group known as obraz read ; " we should break this kid 's bones , and then his ideas . "
obraz considers any pro-western serb to be a traitor , since nato bombed the country during the kosovo war in the late 1990 's .
ultranationalists still have a strong presence in serbian society , as they regularly take part in street protests .
in 2008 , after the united states declared its support for kosovo 's independence , the american embassy in belgrade was set on fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultranationalist mladen obradovic opposes pocesta 's pro-western views pocesta has been given official protection , but says the threats will not stop him from doing his work .
" i 'll continue being a human rights activist and i 'll never step down , no matter what threats , " said pocesta .
" if i step down , it will be the failure of democracy in this country .
it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
mladen obradovic , the general secretary of obraz , did not think the violent threats on the group 's website were serious , but nevertheless does not approve of pocesta 's views .
" there is something wrong with this boy , " said obradovic .
" but i hope , since he 's still very young , that there is enough time for him to become a better pupil , a better serb , a better christian , a better person . "
political tug-of-war pocesta 's story reflects a larger political struggle within serbia , with one liberal side keen to move on from the past , and the other remaining fiercely nationalistic .
serbia 's pro-western government applied for eu membership at the end of last year .
the eu boosted serbia 's bid by unfreezing a free trade agreement with belgrade as well as allowing visa-free travel throughout the schengen zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu integration is not popular with all serbs however , kosovo 's declaration of independence in 2008 still remains an issue between the eu and serbia , as all but five eu members now recognize kosovo as an independent state .
pocesta does have at least one fan within serbia 's government , marko karadzic , the state secretary for human rights .
karadzic says he shares pocesta 's desire to eradicate the remnants of serbia 's violent past .
" you still have those violent groups and they simply do n't see themselves in a system where you have rules , " said karadzic .
" this is completely unacceptable because we have to show that we have learnt about the evil of war and violence and that we are going to fight against it . "

nationalism is still strong in the balkan state , and liberal pro-western advocates are in the minority .
but recently , that minority has been getting more attention - all because of a twelve-year-old boy named rastko pocesta .
as a young pro-western social activist , pocesta has gained fame through articles he 's published on blogs and facebook , which campaign for serbia to join the european union and nato .
he also supports the independence of kosovo , despite the serbian government 's stance that it is not a separate country .
" serbia should be a country in which human , civil , political and minority rights are maximally respected , " rastko said .
" it should be a country which is not seen through the wars in the 1990 's and the war crimes but by its involvement in international affairs . "
rastko added that serbian membership in the eu would bring economic stability and prosperty .
the young activist also believes nato membership would help improve the security of all serbs .
harsh feedback despite his young age , pocesta is not immune from violent threats made via the internet .
ultranationalists within serbia have begun to take notice of his work and say he 's betrayed serb values .
one post on the forum of a right-wing group known as obraz read ; " we should break this kid 's bones , and then his ideas . "
obraz considers any pro-western serb to be a traitor , since nato bombed the country during the kosovo war in the late 1990 's .
ultranationalists still have a strong presence in serbian society , as they regularly take part in street protests .
in 2008 , after the united states declared its support for kosovo 's independence , the american embassy in belgrade was set on fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultranationalist mladen obradovic opposes pocesta 's pro-western views pocesta has been given official protection , but says the threats will not stop him from doing his work .
" i 'll continue being a human rights activist and i 'll never step down , no matter what threats , " said pocesta .
" if i step down , it will be the failure of democracy in this country .
it 's the worst thing that can happen . "
mladen obradovic , the general secretary of obraz , did not think the violent threats on the group 's website were serious , but nevertheless does not approve of pocesta 's views .
" there is something wrong with this boy , " said obradovic .
" but i hope , since he 's still very young , that there is enough time for him to become a better pupil , a better serb , a better christian , a better person . "
political tug-of-war pocesta 's story reflects a larger political struggle within serbia , with one liberal side keen to move on from the past , and the other remaining fiercely nationalistic .
serbia 's pro-western government applied for eu membership at the end of last year .
the eu boosted serbia 's bid by unfreezing a free trade agreement with belgrade as well as allowing visa-free travel throughout the schengen zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu integration is not popular with all serbs however , kosovo 's declaration of independence in 2008 still remains an issue between the eu and serbia , as all but five eu members now recognize kosovo as an independent state .
pocesta does have at least one fan within serbia 's government , marko karadzic , the state secretary for human rights .
karadzic says he shares pocesta 's desire to eradicate the remnants of serbia 's violent past .
" you still have those violent groups and they simply do n't see themselves in a system where you have rules , " said karadzic .
" this is completely unacceptable because we have to show that we have learnt about the evil of war and violence and that we are going to fight against it . "

the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- says they amount to a record 350 cases - the highest number yet . of the 350 preliminary investigations into suspected islamist terrorists , 220 inquiries are currently being handled by germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , and " almost half of those are aimed at finding the perpetrators of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , " bka chief joerg ziercke said . under german law , attacks on german nationals anywhere are a crime and must be investigated if a complaint is made .
however , according to guido steinberg , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , the upsurge in proceedings against islamist terror suspects is not only due to attacks on german soldiers in afghanistan that are prosecuted here in germany .
" a kind of german jihadist scene has emerged since 2006 , and that is also why the number of people under scrutiny has risen , " steinberg told deutsche welle .
" associates of islamic terrorism " the bka considers about 1,100 people in germany to be part of an " islamist terrorist personnel potential . "

" some germans have joined the islamic movement of uzbekistan , which is taking part in attacks on german soldiers , but there is no evidence that germans take part in these attacks , " he said .
" but that might happen at any time since , obviously , there is an interest on their part to fight german soldiers . "

" a kind of german jihadist scene has emerged since 2006 , and that is also why the number of people under scrutiny has risen , " steinberg told deutsche welle .
" associates of islamic terrorism " the bka considers about 1,100 people in germany to be part of an " islamist terrorist personnel potential . "
" nationwide , security forces have an eye on 127 potentially threatening individuals , " ziercke told the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are increasingly targeted by taliban insurgents since the beginning of last year , there has been an increase in the number of germans travelling to islamist training camps , zierke said .
" more than 30 young germans went to afghanistan or pakistan in 2009 . "
" there 's a german community in the area now .
a group of 10-12 people is trying to lure others with german-language propaganda , " he said .
" unfortunately , they are successful . "
a kind of pipeline the germans in pakistani islamic training camps were showing their countrymen how to get terrorist training there , guido steinberg said .
" they serve as a kind of role model . "
steinberg said there was speculation about whether german nationals were participating in attacks on german soldiers in afghanistan .
" some germans have joined the islamic movement of uzbekistan , which is taking part in attacks on german soldiers , but there is no evidence that germans take part in these attacks , " he said .
" but that might happen at any time since , obviously , there is an interest on their part to fight german soldiers . "

trading tiles for vegetation , green roofs promise both environmental and economic benefits . standing in the street , you probably would n't notice it . yet dusseldorf , the affluent capital of the western german state of north rhine westphalia , is home to more than 730,000 square meters of greenery above people 's heads . that 's roughly equivalent to 100 football fields spread over some 1,700 buildings and last year this feat won the city an award from the international green roof association -lrb- igra -rrb- . more than just a rooftop garden , a ' green roof ' is a different way of approaching architecture , using vegetation supported by waterproof materials instead of conventional construction materials . green roofs live longer green roofs have a number of benefits , including improved insulation and energy savings , but for some they also represent an aesthetic statement . " we wanted to make our car park more attractive , and at the time , replacing the facade and roof was imminent , " said ernst hagemann , the owner and operator of a green roofed multi-story car park in dusseldorf 's city center . although he admits that being a " nature-lover " influenced his decision when it came time to modernize in the 1980s , he says there were obvious practical benefits to covering his roof in earth and moss . back then , the city of dusseldorf subsidized 50 percent of the cost through a green roofing program .
while green roofs are more expensive to build than standard ones , hagemann saw economic savings in the long run .
" from the cost perspective , it was only marginally more expensive with the subsidy that we received from the city , " he said .
" if you consider that typical roofing felt needs to be repaired every five years or so and that after 12 or 15 years it needs to be completely replaced , then a green roof is definitely cheaper . "
the green roof on hagemann 's multi-story car park has not needed any repairs in the 25 years since it was installed .
this is because the layer of vegetation that has been planted over a waterproofing membrane protects the actual roof underneath it .
and there are other economic advantages too green roofs deliver savings through energy efficiency .
in the summer months , the roofs help save on air conditioning because of their cooling properties , and in winter they help save on heating because of their insulation .
bildunterschrift : green roofs have numerous benefits for the people who live underneath them services rendered they also offer a service to cities as a whole , helping moderate temperatures in the concrete jungle – a major reason why dusseldorf is backing green roof uptake , says katja holzmueller from the city 's environment department .
" the ability of green roofs to reduce thermal heating in cities is our primary motivation to promote green roofing , " she said .
" green roofs absorb rain water and so it evaporates more slowly … -lrb- they -rrb- therefore have a cooling effect . "
this cooling effect is especially interesting for areas that get hot in summer , because of cities ' tendency to trap heat , which can be deadly – especially for the elderly – during heat waves .
the roofs also provide an opportunity for flora and fauna to find room to survive in cities .
according to the berlin-based igra , green roofs especially promote biodiversity , providing shelter and food for bees , butterflies and beetles .
car park owner ernst hagemann is pleased with the little creatures his green roof has attracted , despite its location just off a busy dusseldorf street .
" there are many insects and birds here that were long gone from the city .
i 've seen a wren , chaffinches , greenfinches – all kinds of birds , " he said .
the benefits of green roofs do n't stop here though , according to igra .
they can also enhance the quality of life for city slickers by reducing noise levels , and can reduce flooding and damage to sewer systems because they reduce water run-off by 50-90 percent during storms .

" it 's very important that employees have green areas where they can take a break … important studies about this have been conducted in germany , " said christian schulze-ardey from the bonn-based landscape research , development & construction society , which publishes technical guidelines for green roofs and buildings .

the opposition wants a new law to be passed by parliament before any rescue plan can be finalized . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is holding a meeting of party leaders about actions the country should take to help tackle the greek financial crisis .
the talks on monday are expected to focus on the technical details of making finance available as the likelihood grows that germany will be asked to help .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
opposition politicians want a special law to be to be passed by both the upper and lower parliamentary houses , before any transaction is approved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said that greece needed to overhaul its economy schaeuble has warned athens that an overhaul of its economy was " unavoidable and an absolute prerequisite " for berlin and the eu to approve the aid .
volker kauder , parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said his party would help greece if necessary .
he added that any financial support would be subject to strict conditions .
" if the conditions are met , we 'll do it .
the chancellor has always said the last resort would be when the stability of the euro is in danger .
i think we 'll get the majorities in the coalition then , " kauder told german public broadcaster ard television .

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

greece should leave the eurozone , some critics say . greece must agree to tough new austerity measures before it receives any financial aid from the european union , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said ahead of a meeting monday of party leaders about how germany should help tackle the greek financial crisis .
greece announced on friday that it would have to seek financial support from the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to the tune of 45 billion euros -lrb- us $ 60.1 billion -rrb- .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is expected to be responsible for providing 8.4 billion euros out of the 30 billion euros that europe could be asked to provide this year .
for germany to provide this aid , " depends entirely on whether greece continues with the strict savings course it has launched , " schaeuble told the sunday edition of " bild " newspaper .
coalition rift ?
a similar demand was raised by the german foreign minister guido westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader westerwelle fears having to ditch tax relief plans as a result of the crisis " it has yet to be agreed that greece will actually get assistance from europe at all " , he told german zdf television , and added : " we will not write a blank cheque " .
however some members of westerwelle 's liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- were more critical of the greek request .
the fdp is chancellor angel merkel 's junior coalition partner in the government .
fdp deputy leader andreas pinkwart said it would be " a slap in the face of german employees " if the government would give billions of euros to athens , and tell germans " there 's no money left for easing their tax burden . "
the party 's finance expert hermann otto solms also criticized finance minister schaeuble ’ s plans .
" it was wrong to put the pot of honey in the middle of the table right from the start , " he said .
" that was a signal for the greeks to just help themselves . "
the right thing to do would have been to offer greece no help and direct them straight to the imf , solms told the passauer neue presse daily .
" this is where mr schaeuble made a mistake , " he said .
call for greece to leave euro zone the government ’ s role in the rescue package also received criticism from chancellor merkel ’ s second coalition partner , the bavarian-based csu party .
csu parliamentary leader hans-peter friedrich said his party would prefer athens to leave the eurozone and solve its problems by " re-introducing its former national currency , the drachme , at a devalued rate of exchange " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists believe the aid package wo n't help greece friedrich 's opinion was echoed by economist joachim starbaty from tuebingen university .
greece was " no longer competitive within the eurozone , " he said .
" it 's impossible for the country to repay its debts and the loans it now receives because its economy will be unable to accumulate surpluses for a long time " , he said .
" devaluing a national currency is the only chance for greece to regain its competitiveness . "
starbaty announced on monday he would lodge an official complaint with germany 's constitutional court should parliament in berlin give the green light to the bailout package .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.04.2010 green roofs take earth-friendly urban living to new heights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this green roof livens up an otherwise typical car park buildings in the german city of dusseldorf prove the sky is the limit when it comes to enriching the urban environment .
trading tiles for vegetation , green roofs promise both environmental and economic benefits . standing in the street , you probably would n't notice it . yet dusseldorf , the affluent capital of the western german state of north rhine westphalia , is home to more than 730,000 square meters of greenery above people 's heads . that 's roughly equivalent to 100 football fields spread over some 1,700 buildings and last year this feat won the city an award from the international green roof association -lrb- igra -rrb- . more than just a rooftop garden , a ' green roof ' is a different way of approaching architecture , using vegetation supported by waterproof materials instead of conventional construction materials . green roofs live longer green roofs have a number of benefits , including improved insulation and energy savings , but for some they also represent an aesthetic statement . " we wanted to make our car park more attractive , and at the time , replacing the facade and roof was imminent , " said ernst hagemann , the owner and operator of a green roofed multi-story car park in dusseldorf 's city center . although he admits that being a " nature-lover " influenced his decision when it came time to modernize in the 1980s , he says there were obvious practical benefits to covering his roof in earth and moss . back then , the city of dusseldorf subsidized 50 percent of the cost through a green roofing program .
while green roofs are more expensive to build than standard ones , hagemann saw economic savings in the long run .
" from the cost perspective , it was only marginally more expensive with the subsidy that we received from the city , " he said .
" if you consider that typical roofing felt needs to be repaired every five years or so and that after 12 or 15 years it needs to be completely replaced , then a green roof is definitely cheaper . "
the green roof on hagemann 's multi-story car park has not needed any repairs in the 25 years since it was installed .
this is because the layer of vegetation that has been planted over a waterproofing membrane protects the actual roof underneath it .
and there are other economic advantages too green roofs deliver savings through energy efficiency .
in the summer months , the roofs help save on air conditioning because of their cooling properties , and in winter they help save on heating because of their insulation .
bildunterschrift : green roofs have numerous benefits for the people who live underneath them services rendered they also offer a service to cities as a whole , helping moderate temperatures in the concrete jungle – a major reason why dusseldorf is backing green roof uptake , says katja holzmueller from the city 's environment department .
" the ability of green roofs to reduce thermal heating in cities is our primary motivation to promote green roofing , " she said .
" green roofs absorb rain water and so it evaporates more slowly … -lrb- they -rrb- therefore have a cooling effect . "
this cooling effect is especially interesting for areas that get hot in summer , because of cities ' tendency to trap heat , which can be deadly – especially for the elderly – during heat waves .
the roofs also provide an opportunity for flora and fauna to find room to survive in cities .
according to the berlin-based igra , green roofs especially promote biodiversity , providing shelter and food for bees , butterflies and beetles .
car park owner ernst hagemann is pleased with the little creatures his green roof has attracted , despite its location just off a busy dusseldorf street .
" there are many insects and birds here that were long gone from the city .
i 've seen a wren , chaffinches , greenfinches – all kinds of birds , " he said .
the benefits of green roofs do n't stop here though , according to igra .
they can also enhance the quality of life for city slickers by reducing noise levels , and can reduce flooding and damage to sewer systems because they reduce water run-off by 50-90 percent during storms .
productivity gains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green roofs offer employees a place to a take a break green roofs are also catching on in the corporate world a means of improving productivity .
" it 's very important that employees have green areas where they can take a break … important studies about this have been conducted in germany , " said christian schulze-ardey from the bonn-based landscape research , development & construction society , which publishes technical guidelines for green roofs and buildings .
" for example , bmw put a lot of green structure in its offices and the result was a very low rate of illness .
i think that 's a sign of the importance of green structures and green roofing , " he said .
schulze-ardey also believes german expertise in green roofing is highly prized overseas , because of the country 's decades-long experience in engineering the structures . " we often have demand from people in america to buy our guidelines , " he said , adding that green roofs had an even more important role to play in the us where cities are much large than in germany .
in the meantime , green roof leader dusseldorf is n't resting on its laurels .
the city introduced a new incentive this year – a reduced sewage charge for buildings with green roofs .
the city is also conducting research to see just how much of an impact green roofs have in curbing temperatures and cutting run-off . author : laura schweiger editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a two-day party convention in the western city of cologne , foreign minister and head of the liberal party , guido westerwelle , proposed 16 billion euros worth of tax cuts per year from 2012 , aimed at supporting those who earn up to 53,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,000 -rrb- .
taking a swipe at german finance minister and christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , who is against tax cuts for budgetary reasons , westerwelle said in cologne : " i can not accept that in this country , as soon as the issue of tax relief is raised , immediately , people say , there 's no money available . "
mounting debt schaeuble , as well as many others in his party , point out that there is no money for generous tax cuts .
germany 's public debt stands at some 73 percent of national income , which has seen schaeuble take on record new borrowing of 80.2 billion euros in the 2010 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's budget has suffered during the recent financial crisis according to a recent poll for public broadcaster zdf , 61 percent of germans agree with schaeuble that the state of germany 's public finances makes tax cuts inappropriate .
but westerwelle insists fair taxation and sound fiscal policies are " two sides of the same coin . "
lower taxes help middle earners and small and medium-sized businesses , creating new jobs that will eventually boost tax revenues , according to the free democrats .
crucial vote the free democrats party convention in cologne comes ahead of crucial elections in north-rhine westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
the vote there is seen as an important test for berlin .
both north-rhine westphalia 's and the federal governments are made up of a coalition of christian and free democrats .
a defeat in north-rhine westphalia on may 9 could not only cost the government the majority in germany 's upper house , it would also likely be seen as a wake-up call for merkel and her coalition partners. ng / apn / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , after only nine months , he 's been given the pink slip , as the club tries to salvage its season .
but there 's little left to salvage . hamburg 's board of directors announced labbadia would be leaving the club involuntarily on monday , one day after the team suffered a disastrous 5-1 loss to hoffenheim in the bundesliga and three days before a crucial away tie to fulham in the europa league semi-finals .
" we can not and did not want to continue in this formation , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told reporters after meeting with labbadia .
" we found we could n't expect to win against fulham .
it was the last point at which we could act so as not to endanger our season goal of qualifying for europe . "
but hamburg 's chances are already in grave danger .
in seventh place in the table , and five points behind sixth-placed stuttgart , hamburg 's prospects of qualifying via the league are slim-to-none .
hamburg 's best bet is to win the europa cup outright .
but their desultory nil-nil draw in their home tie against fulham last week hardly put them in an ideal position to do that .
" labbadia is a dead issue , " a representative of the hamburg board declared tersely to reporters earlier on monday .
and it all started so well bildunterschrift : it 's been a painful 2010 for the northern german side this was supposed to be hamburg 's year .
after a few seasons of relative austerity , hofmann loosened the purse strings this summer , bringing in highly coveted young talents eljero elia and marcus berg , veteran midfielder ze roberto and labbadia , whose move from leverkusen is reported to have cost 1.3 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- .
many hamburg fans were skeptical about his appointment , given his relative lack of first-division experience and the fact that leverkusen faded badly last season under his command .
but labbadia surprised his critics , getting the revamped squad off to a hot start .
hamburg were fourth over the winter break , and when hofmann brought in veteran star ruud van nistelrooy in january to bolster an injury-prone attack , many people considered the northern germans a dark-horse candidate for the title .
ca n't we all just get along ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero is just one player who 's lost his orientation but little , if anything , has gone right in 2010 for hamburg .
since the break , the team has managed only four wins in 15 matches , forgetting how to score goals in the process .
part of that was due to injuries .
ze roberto , and hamburg 's most reliable striker mladen petric , missed significant action this year , and elia , who looked like a winner , is out for the rest of the season .
but disciplinary problems and internal rancor have been equally , if not more , significant in hamburg 's tumble .
peruvian striker paolo guerrero went awol for weeks , claiming he was too afraid of flying to return from his home country , where he was recovering from a knee injury .
and when he did finally arrive in hamburg , he promptly got himself suspended for the rest of the season for throwing a water bottle at a fan - critics said it was the best aim he 'd displayed in months .
moreover , both van nistelrooy and team captain and goalkeeper frank rost publicly criticized labbadia , with the dutch striker questioning the coach 's ability to communicate tactics .
technique coach ricardo moniz now takes over on an interim basis , as hamburg attempt to put the pieces back together .
his first assignment is in fulham on thursday .

at a press conference on monday , lies hebbadj , an algerian-born 35 year-old butcher , responded to suggestions by french interior minister brice hortefeux that he should lose his french passport because he was believed to have four wives who had given him 12 children who were all receiving welfare benefits .
" as far as i know , it is not forbidden to have mistresses in france , nor is it forbidden under islam , " said hebbadj .
" if you lose your french nationality for having mistresses , then a lot of french men would have been stripped of their citizenship . "
hebbadj became a french citizen in 1999 , after marrying a woman with french nationality .
hebbadj 's case received political and media attention after his wife was stopped and fined by police in nantes for driving while wearing a full-face veil , known as a " niqab " .
she was fined 22 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- on april 2 because police said the veil restricted her view and compromised her ability to drive safely .
she has so far refused to pay the fine .
unveiled controversy the political row over hebbadj comes as the french government is preparing legislation to ban the wearing of the full-face veil .
french president nicolas sarkozy has said that the veil is " not welcome " in france , calling it an affront to french values that denigrates women .
however , sarkozy 's critics say he is simply pandering to far-right voters after his party 's defeat in regional elections last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says full veils are not welcome in france french opinion polls show that 64 percent of the population either support a full ban on the niqab and burqa or approve of them at least being outlawed from state institutions .
the head of the french council of the muslim faith , mohamed moussaoui , said hebbadj 's case had been inflated by the media .
" if there was polygamy , the laws are clear on that and muslims in france are respectful of laws , " said moussaoui .
he added that , in contrast , a weekend gun attack on a mosque in southern france had received little attention .
a draft law for the ban on full-face veils is set to be presented to french ministers next month. mk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a press conference on monday , lies hebbadj , an algerian-born 35 year-old butcher , responded to suggestions by french interior minister brice hortefeux that he should lose his french passport because he was believed to have four wives who had given him 12 children who were all receiving welfare benefits .
" as far as i know , it is not forbidden to have mistresses in france , nor is it forbidden under islam , " said hebbadj .
" if you lose your french nationality for having mistresses , then a lot of french men would have been stripped of their citizenship . "
hebbadj became a french citizen in 1999 , after marrying a woman with french nationality .
hebbadj 's case received political and media attention after his wife was stopped and fined by police in nantes for driving while wearing a full-face veil , known as a " niqab " .
she was fined 22 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- on april 2 because police said the veil restricted her view and compromised her ability to drive safely .
she has so far refused to pay the fine .
unveiled controversy the political row over hebbadj comes as the french government is preparing legislation to ban the wearing of the full-face veil .
french president nicolas sarkozy has said that the veil is " not welcome " in france , calling it an affront to french values that denigrates women .
however , sarkozy 's critics say he is simply pandering to far-right voters after his party 's defeat in regional elections last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says full veils are not welcome in france french opinion polls show that 64 percent of the population either support a full ban on the niqab and burqa or approve of them at least being outlawed from state institutions .
the head of the french council of the muslim faith , mohamed moussaoui , said hebbadj 's case had been inflated by the media .
" if there was polygamy , the laws are clear on that and muslims in france are respectful of laws , " said moussaoui .
he added that , in contrast , a weekend gun attack on a mosque in southern france had received little attention .
a draft law for the ban on full-face veils is set to be presented to french ministers next month. mk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this was president karzai 's first visit to india after his re-election last year . during the talks manmohan singh and afghan president hamid karzai discussed a whole raft of issues impinging directly on peace and stability in afghanistan . backing " an afghan-led and afghan-owned " rebuilding of afghanistan , manmohan singh underlined india 's unwavering commitment to continuing reconstruction work in that country and said repeated attacks on indians would not deter his country from carrying on with this process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singh has asked karzai to protect the lives of indian citizens who are helping in afghanistan commitment to assist afghanistan prime minister singh said india remained committed to assisting afghanistan in its development efforts and said the development partnership was focused on areas of infrastructure development , human resource development and capacity building , food assistance and small development projects that bring immediate benefit to the people at the grass-roots level .
india has pledged $ 1.3 billion -lrb- almost one billion euros -rrb- for a slew of reconstruction and infrastructure projects in afghanistan .
but at the same time he sought an assurance that the security of indians in afghanistan would be treated with utmost priority considering the recent attacks on indian nationals . " on the issue of terrorism which threatens our region , president karzai assured me that the government of afghanistan will take all possible measures for the security of indians in afghanistan , " said singh .

common struggle against terrorism underlining the common struggle against terrorism and extremism karzai briefed manmohan singh on the peace jirga , an assembly of tribal elders , he plans to convene next month and the ongoing efforts to integrate those elements of the taliban which have no links with al qaeda or any terrorist network .
amitabh mattoo , an expert on south asia , was invited for the lunch reception hosted for karzai .
he said india conveyed its concerns on security and the fight against terrorism .
" obviously at the top of the agenda , the so-called reintegration process , the security situation in afghanistan and the need to build the capacity of the afghan national army and the police are on top for anyone who speaks about afghanistan , whether it is president karzai or otherwise , and given what has happened in the last few weeks , the sense of triumphalism within pakistan , that its position within afghanistan seems to be recognized by the west , i think given all this , india must have expressed concern .

he lost that job to donald tusk of the civic platform , who is currently prime minister , in snap elections in november 2007 .
kaczynski said he 'd decided to campaign for the presidential job because poland was a shared responsibility that " demands overcoming personal suffering . "
public mood hard to predict in a recently published poll that had assumed jaroslaw kaczynski would run for president , he received about 26 percent support from those surveyed .
poland 's acting president , bronislaw komorowski , led the poll with nearly 50 percent support as the candidate for the governing , center-right civic platform .
but the public mood is difficult to gauge after the fatal plane accident , which wiped out much of poland 's military and political elite .
" this is not a normal election , " said krzysztof bobinski , director of the warsaw think-tank , unia and polska foundation .
" in reality , it wo n't be him -lrb- jaroslaw -rrb- running , it will be his brother .
his campaign will play on sympathy for his brother . "
all political parties had until this monday to notify the national election commission of their respective candidates .
each candidate must now gather 100,000 signatures of support by may 6 .
under the polish constitution , the date for presidential elections must be announced within two weeks of a sitting president 's death .
voting must then take place within 60 days of that announcement. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a press conference on monday , lies hebbadj , an algerian-born 35 year-old butcher , responded to suggestions by french interior minister brice hortefeux that he should lose his french passport because he was believed to have four wives who had given him 12 children who were all receiving welfare benefits .
" as far as i know , it is not forbidden to have mistresses in france , nor is it forbidden under islam , " said hebbadj .
" if you lose your french nationality for having mistresses , then a lot of french men would have been stripped of their citizenship . "
hebbadj became a french citizen in 1999 , after marrying a woman with french nationality .
hebbadj 's case received political and media attention after his wife was stopped and fined by police in nantes for driving while wearing a full-face veil , known as a " niqab " .
she was fined 22 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- on april 2 because police said the veil restricted her view and compromised her ability to drive safely .
she has so far refused to pay the fine .
unveiled controversy the political row over hebbadj comes as the french government is preparing legislation to ban the wearing of the full-face veil .
french president nicolas sarkozy has said that the veil is " not welcome " in france , calling it an affront to french values that denigrates women .
however , sarkozy 's critics say he is simply pandering to far-right voters after his party 's defeat in regional elections last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says full veils are not welcome in france french opinion polls show that 64 percent of the population either support a full ban on the niqab and burqa or approve of them at least being outlawed from state institutions .
the head of the french council of the muslim faith , mohamed moussaoui , said hebbadj 's case had been inflated by the media .
" if there was polygamy , the laws are clear on that and muslims in france are respectful of laws , " said moussaoui .
he added that , in contrast , a weekend gun attack on a mosque in southern france had received little attention .
a draft law for the ban on full-face veils is set to be presented to french ministers next month. mk / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the president 's life cut tragically short , and the death of poland 's patriotic elite , means one thing to us : we must complete their mission , " jaroslaw kaczynski said in a statement announcing his candidacy .
" we owe this to them ; we owe this to our nation , " he said .
jaroslaw , the elder twin by 45 minutes , heads the opposition right-wing law and justice party and served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 .
he lost that job to donald tusk of the civic platform , who is currently prime minister , in snap elections in november 2007 .
kaczynski said he 'd decided to campaign for the presidential job because poland was a shared responsibility that " demands overcoming personal suffering . "
public mood hard to predict in a recently published poll that had assumed jaroslaw kaczynski would run for president , he received about 26 percent support from those surveyed .
poland 's acting president , bronislaw komorowski , led the poll with nearly 50 percent support as the candidate for the governing , center-right civic platform .
but the public mood is difficult to gauge after the fatal plane accident , which wiped out much of poland 's military and political elite .
" this is not a normal election , " said krzysztof bobinski , director of the warsaw think-tank , unia and polska foundation .
" in reality , it wo n't be him -lrb- jaroslaw -rrb- running , it will be his brother .
his campaign will play on sympathy for his brother . "

belgium 's center-right government collapsed on monday , four days after the prime minister tendered his resignation in a dispute between french and flemish speakers over language and political rights . belgium 's king albert ii has accepted the resignation of prime minister yves leterme 's coalition government amidst feuding between flemish and french speakers over the apportionment of a bilingual brussels electoral district .
it is the third time in as many years that leterme offered to step down when faced by intractable disputes .
" the king has accepted the resignation of the government , " a short statement said , after finance minister didier reynders asked to be relieved of his three-day mission to broker a political solution for deep-rooted linguistic differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister leterme has now quit his job three times the collapse of the government was triggered after the flemish-speaking open vld party announced last week that it was leaving the coalition over controversial plans to redraw the boundaries of the brussels halle-vilvoorde electoral district .
belgium 's constitutional court ruled in 2003 that the so-called bhv district , the only bilingual constituency in the country , would have to be reapportioned .
since then , belgian leaders have remained at loggerheads over flemish demands to make parts of the district monolingual and francophone calls to allow voters throughout the district to support french-speaking political parties .
the downfall of leterme , who will stay on initially in a caretaker capacity , comes at a highly inopportune moment , a little over two months before belgium is slated to take over the european union 's rotating presidency on july 1. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the beginning of a spiral of brutality in central nigeria that has left hundreds dead .
my mum , she cooked for him .
he used to come here to sleep , my mum would give him a key umar d 'adam or " d-boy " as he sheltered in the army barracks , someone handed d-boy a phone .
it was his close friend , vincent alaibe , a christian .
" i just heard his voice telling me , it 's my house , that he 's burned it , " remembers d-boy .
" he was shouting .
he showed other people my house , and they burned it , including him .
" he thought i was dead .
i told him : ' i am alive . " '
months later , the family home in the anglo-jos district is still in ruins : a blackened fridge , the melted remains of a tv , and once-treasured belongings crunch underfoot .
christian men attacked the area with guns , cutlasses and petrol-bombs " my mum , she cooked for him .
he used to come here to sleep , my mum would give him a key , " d-boy says softly .
he has been in contact with vincent , and offers to take us to meet him .
they know he is my friend .
that is why they forced me to do it vincent alaibe the cycle of killing and revenge has changed the identity of whole neighbourhoods in jos and arranging a simple meeting is not easy .
the young friends can only meet outside the neighbourhood ; there is difficulty talking .
slight and fresh faced , barely out of their teens , they sit awkwardly , eyes to the ground .
" if i do n't do it , they are going to kill me , " says vincent , slowly .
' forgiveness ' he describes how a gang of ethnic berom christian men were attacking the area , armed with guns , cutlasses and petrol-bombs .
vincent - one of few christian residents - was singled out , and made to go with them , to point out d-boy 's house .
" they know he is my friend .
that is why they forced me to do it .
they knew that i am a christian , and he is a muslim .
" i am looking for forgiveness , " he chokes .
d-boy stares straight ahead , listening .
" do n't do it again , " he bursts out .
" if this thing happens again , do n't put your hand in it .
i know you are a good person . "
d-boy 's parents have forgiven vincent , and would like to see him again at the family home .
but violent threats of revenge , and fear of arrest , have forced him to move away .
" if i enter the area , they will kill me , " he says .
broken pacts north of the city , people in the tiny christian enclave of chwelnyap , in congo-russia district , were also taken aback by the riots .
" there was an agreement , " insists chief ibrahim choji-dusu .
his community is surrounded by four almost exclusively ethnic hausa muslim neighbourhoods .
our people are being killed any time they pass in that area chief ibrahim choji-dusu the day before , he sat down with his muslim neighbours to discuss the hostile mood .
" the agreement was , there should never be anybody from any of the communities that should attack anybody , " chief choji-dusu says , again and again .
but on morning of 17 january , 170 homes in chwelnyap were torched .
chief chiji-dusu and others recognised those they had spoken with the previous day among the attackers .
" we spoke : ' ah !
you !
we made an agreement yesterday .
why do you attack us now ? " '
" they said : ' no matter how used you are to your chicken , it will not stop you slaughtering it . '
" that is the slogan they use , " he says .
the bbc contacted community leaders in those neighbouring areas .
some said they had never attended the peace meeting on 16 january .
others claimed that residents of chwelnyap attacked first , breaking the agreement .
others admitted that they had lost control of their own youths , as rioting spread elsewhere in the city .
five people from chwelnyap were killed - a number chief choji-dusu considers a lucky escape .
' silent killings ' three months later , he says the people of chwelnyap are ready to forgive .
but the atmosphere has changed , and there has been virtually no exchange about what happened .
because of the crisis , the christians dare not come , and the muslims are playing poker by themselves youth worker emmanuel nanle " our problem is , how do we come and sit together ? " he asks .
" we ca n't go there .
our people are being killed any time they pass in that area .
" once you go , you never come back .
you will be a missing person . "
the police and military continue to recover corpses dumped inside the city limits and in rural villages outside .
victims of the so-called " silent killings " - both berom christians and hausa muslims - are being discovered every week .
" rather than coming together , people are moving apart , " observes emmanuel nanle , a christian youth worker .
