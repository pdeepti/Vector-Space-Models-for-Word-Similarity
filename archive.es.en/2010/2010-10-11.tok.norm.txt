in papua new guinea , home to 76 percent of the world 's coral species and 600 types of fish , most reefs are still considered intact and functional .
widely considered a global epicenter of marine biodiversity , the country is part of the so-called coral triangle - an area that includes the tropical marine waters of indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , timor leste and the solomon islands .
" coral reef systems in papua new guinea are still in their pristine condition , therefore it is not too late to save and protect them , " local marine biologist noel wangunu said .
" it is now important that coral reefs are given some protection so that they build up their resilience to withstand impacts . "
extreme heat bleaches coral the biggest risk comes from rising temperatures , with potentially significant impacts on food security and livelihoods in vulnerable coastal communities .
coral reefs are the foundation not only of important fishing industries but also of tourist economies . the effects of climate change are felt more directly in the oceans than on land , even if these impacts are less visible . this year 's extreme heat is putting the world 's coral reefs under severe stress .
" -lrb- global warming -rrb- impacts on coral reefs through ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperatures , driving massive coral bleaching effects , " wangunu said .

" watershed pollution also affects the region , largely as a result of forest clearance , erosion and inland mining , which is a source of sediments and pollution into reef systems which can smother corals in the near shore .

experts say that conservation concepts need to be better explained to local communities in terms of how they will benefit from their resources .

“ there is very little in the way of a traditional conservation ethic anywhere in melanesia -lrb- a group of islands in the pacific ocean -rrb- , " simon foale from the australian research council center of excellence for coral reef studies said .

they 're also a key source of food , income and coastal protection for around 500 million people worldwide .
but the reefs are increasingly at risk .
a 2008 study by the global coral reef monitoring network said that a fifth of the world 's coral reefs have died or been destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coral reefs off papua new guinea are still largely intact however the situation is n't without hope .
in papua new guinea , home to 76 percent of the world 's coral species and 600 types of fish , most reefs are still considered intact and functional .
widely considered a global epicenter of marine biodiversity , the country is part of the so-called coral triangle - an area that includes the tropical marine waters of indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , timor leste and the solomon islands .
" coral reef systems in papua new guinea are still in their pristine condition , therefore it is not too late to save and protect them , " local marine biologist noel wangunu said .
" it is now important that coral reefs are given some protection so that they build up their resilience to withstand impacts . "
extreme heat bleaches coral the biggest risk comes from rising temperatures , with potentially significant impacts on food security and livelihoods in vulnerable coastal communities .
coral reefs are the foundation not only of important fishing industries but also of tourist economies . the effects of climate change are felt more directly in the oceans than on land , even if these impacts are less visible . this year 's extreme heat is putting the world 's coral reefs under severe stress .
" -lrb- global warming -rrb- impacts on coral reefs through ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperatures , driving massive coral bleaching effects , " wangunu said .
but the more immediate causes of coral reef degradation are brought about by local economies and human-driven activities including coastal development , deforestation and unrestricted tourism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-driven activities are largely to blame for the loss of corals " overfishing is a significant threat to reef systems in the pacific , " nicola barnard , acting director of the international coral reef action network , said .
" watershed pollution also affects the region , largely as a result of forest clearance , erosion and inland mining , which is a source of sediments and pollution into reef systems which can smother corals in the near shore .
moreover , urbanization has led to direct clearance of mangroves and has had indirect impacts from solid waste and sewage dumping . " raising awareness experts agree that raising community awareness is the key to conserving corals . " the majority of papua new guineans are yet to fully understand the threats facing the oceans and its consequences on biological diversity , " wanganu said .
" many coastal societies use the sea as a ' supermarket ' to support their daily livelihood .
there is general understanding of the shortage of commercially viable species and the declining biodiversity , but they lack the ability to piece together all these changes and develop management strategies to address these . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coastal communities use the sea as a " supermarket " the survival of the coral reefs depends on the local population learning how to balance its economic needs while respecting the environment .
experts say that conservation concepts need to be better explained to local communities in terms of how they will benefit from their resources .
and involving local communities in any effort to conserve the marine ecosystems is just as important .
“ there is very little in the way of a traditional conservation ethic anywhere in melanesia -lrb- a group of islands in the pacific ocean -rrb- , " simon foale from the australian research council center of excellence for coral reef studies said .
" in the modern context of rapidly burgeoning populations and markets , there is a need for good science communication about the impacts of heavy fishing on population dynamics of reef fisheries which , together with the very rich local knowledge that is present in many communities , can help people come up with their own management solutions . "
global solution needed while coral-rich countries such as papua new guinea explore local solutions to preserve its natural wealth , experts point out that a global approach is the only way to ultimately win the fight to save corals .
the protection of coral reefs and the biodiversity they harbor are now part of international negotiations on curbing climate change .
last year at a meeting in denmark organized by the global legislators organisation for a balanced environment -lrb- globe -rrb- , researchers said that most coral reefs may not survive even if tough regulations on greenhouse gases are put in place .
some experts point out that human behavior too needs to change if the vulnerable ecosystems are to be saved .
" the most important thing we can do for coral reefs is reduce our co2 emissions , ” stephanie wear , director of coral reef conservation at the nature conservancy , an ngo supporting the papua new guinea government 's effort to conserve biodiversity , said .
“ the global community takes its toll .
for example : the choices we make in seafood impact coral reefs .
avoiding coral reef fish on the menu is something that any person can do no matter where they are in the world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 11.10.2010 csu to vote on gender quota for women in leadership roles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebler said the 40-percent quota is only a first step the christian social union of bavaria is one of germany 's most old-school conservative political parties - and it has the lowest rate of female membership .
but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 11.10.2010 germany coach loew could end ' special relationship ' with podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , is the weak link in a great midfield as germany try to keep their perfect euro 2012 qualification record intact against minnows kazakhstan on tuesday , the mood in the squad is buoyant .
but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .
but klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in poland and ukraine , and it 's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt .
cacau is a different sort of forward , while stefan kiessling is injured long term , and mario gomez seems to have completely lost the plot .
and a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system loew employed to such effect in south africa .
unfortunately for loew , there are n't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the bundesliga .
if that situation does n't change , germany 's embarrassment of riches in midfield might not be enough for loew to achieve his stated aim for 2012 - leading the team to their first major international title since 1996 .

it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

deutsche welle : some argue that it is not fair to use the nobel peace prize for political reasons .
but isn ’ t peace itself a political term ?
geir lundestad : peace has certainly something to do with politics .
it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .
and at a time when china has become so important in international affairs , i think these chinese leaders should expect to be held accountable to the treaties they have signed or ratified and to the relevant clauses in their own constitution .

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 11.10.2010 germany coach loew could end ' special relationship ' with podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , is the weak link in a great midfield as germany try to keep their perfect euro 2012 qualification record intact against minnows kazakhstan on tuesday , the mood in the squad is buoyant .
but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .
but klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in poland and ukraine , and it 's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt .
cacau is a different sort of forward , while stefan kiessling is injured long term , and mario gomez seems to have completely lost the plot .
and a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system loew employed to such effect in south africa .
unfortunately for loew , there are n't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the bundesliga .
if that situation does n't change , germany 's embarrassment of riches in midfield might not be enough for loew to achieve his stated aim for 2012 - leading the team to their first major international title since 1996 .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
dead fish found in hungary 's danube after toxic spill this toxic spill is a reminder to all who benefit from industry that we must demand clean up which protects the environmental future of our children . - anne , canada it is inconceivable to have allowed such an amount of toxic waste to accumulate -lrb- near human habitation and crucial rivers , no less ! -rrb- .
where was the eu when prevention mattered ?
i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .
the villages downstream must be prepared to move to higher ground .
a rental company of trucks could help move materials and the train system could carry the soil to be burned .
gps should be used to send information to a command center and follow the water movement with google earth . - malcolm , canada if hungary is so concerned over the availability of drinkable water , why has it sold the rights to nestle to take water from the kali basin by the thousands of gallons daily ?
this well is only 25 miles or so from the toxic sludge spill .
i question any country 's carelessness that is so willing to sell precious resources such as drinkable water at this time . - emmie , us there is a way to manage river water flow in a way to help minimize the spread and provide ph neutralization .
but i 'll be needed to be heard at the highest levels .
this is europe 's deepwater horizon , in my view . - vivek , india while the results of investigation of the causes of the catastrophe are not yet known , it seem that the mal zrt. company must bear full responsibility for the disaster .
while it is hard to say if the measures taken by hungarian authorities have been the best possible , i am impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of hungarian catastrophe teams .
it is sad to see , however , that some actors of international media are trying to create panic rather than contribute to objective communication . - borisz , hungary of course enough is not being done to prevent a second spill if there are fears of new toxic spill .
now we can barely hear the strauss 's vals " the blue danube , " next month we will hear from a metal band : “ the toxic danube . ”
an apology for this industry is not enough , it must be closed or at least it has to pay all damages to this village or put it them in condition again . - henry , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin is particularly fertile ground , say the artists . for decades , urban art forms involving spray cans , stencils and paste-ups have been executed under the cover of darkness .
often merging social commentary with urban beautification , artists needed to work quickly - and stay one step ahead of police and security guards . now , street art is wandering from the alley to the art gallery - thanks to star underground artists like britain 's banksy , who auctioned a piece for 288,000 pounds -lrb- around $ 460,000 -rrb- in 2007 and raised the eyebrows of gallerists the world over . recently in berlin , galleries representing street artists have popped up across the city .
with the significant leap from outdoors to indoors already accomplished , street art fairs were bound to follow - even though these have traditionally been the domain of mainstream art forms .
street art 's answer to basel and venice is stroke.03 , held in berlin this past week . " most of the -lsb- street -rsb- artists represented here ca n't do illegal work , or they do n't want to do illegal work anymore because they can not finish a piece in five minutes without having any lights , " marco schwalbe , a co-founder of stroke.03 , told deutsche welle .
he added that moving into galleries was simply a practical step for many street artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british artist banksy has been instrumental in " legitimizing " street art schwalbe also runs the intoxicated demons urban art gallery in berlin 's alternative kreuzberg district .
as a gallerist , he saw the need for an art fair dedicated to the worldwide phenomenon of urban art and also affordable for smaller up-and-coming galleries . gaining legitimacy indoors and out danish street artist morten andersen , whose work is represented at stroke.03 , learned the art of graffiti as a hip hop-obsessed teenager in the late 1980s .
after spraying illegally for 10 years , he now only works at locations where he has permission , but has also moved indoors to work on canvas . " what i like about painting inside is you can take the raw vibe that you have from the street and put this on a canvas , " he said .
" and you can take this canvas a lot of places .
you can take it to la for a show .
you can take it to berlin for a show .
this you ca n't do with a wall . " while his lines , forms and colors clearly reference his graffiti background , the works themselves are an abstract form of urban expression . emess , a berlin-based stencil artist , appreciates the dialogue that occurs when artists paint in public spaces , rather than on canvases in isolated studios . " something i love about the street is when you put something out there and it 's trashed the next day you know it was n't worth it , " he said , " but if people paint around it , like even house owners painting the facade around your piece - that 's cool . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stencil art - like this work by snik & finbarr - is an alternative to the old-school spray can emess was inspired when he saw figurative works that communicated a message by well-known street artists like banksy and new york-based swoon . " when i saw the first banksy show , i started cutting stencils the next day , " said emess . street art is for everyone compared to many more conservative cities , the street art scene in berlin is more tolerated by both the authorities and the residents , said artist morten andersen . " there 's always been this thing with spray cans .
you know when people see it they feel like , ' shall we call the cops or clap our hands ? " ' said andersen , who added that the hype around artists like banksy has helped legitimize urban art among the general public . but with this sudden hype have come collectors and others wanting to cash in by cutting works by well-known street artists out of fences , gates and sides of buildings in order to sell them for inflated prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroke.03 attracted street artists from around the world , like american chor boogie according to stroke.03 co-founder schwalbe , " if you put something on public property , then somebody might take it .
i think that 's part of the process and i would never sue anybody who 's doing that . " but berlin-based artist emess disagreed .
" it ’ s a little bit like a lawn full of flowers .
if everybody collects one flower , in the end it 's empty , " he explained .
that 's one of the main reasons emess also sells his work in a gallery . " if you really like it , then pay the artist and the gallerist and buy something in a gallery and then you have it , " he said .
" and then you 're supporting the art form and the artist . " author : cinnamon nippard editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" linda could have died as a result of a grenade detonated by the task force during the result , " cameron told a news conference in london .
he said that the top us commander in afghanistan , general david petraeus , had contacted him earlier on monday to inform him that after a review of the incident new information had come to light with regard to the circumstances of norgrove 's death .
" general petraeus told me that -lsb- the review -rsb- had revealed evidence to indicate that linda may not have died at the hands of her captors as originally believed . "
the announcement came a day after a british government official said norgrove was likely killed by a suicide vest held by one of the kidnappers .
no mention was made of her death being caused by the troops involved in the rescue operation .
captors ' ultimately responsible ' cameron said a us-uk investigation would be launched into the affair immediately but made it clear that his intent was not to incriminate any soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunar province is notorious for taliban activity " we should also remember that , ultimately , the responsibility for linda 's death lies with those who took her hostage .
the us forces placed their own lives in danger .
i want to thank them for their courage . "
cameron 's words were echoed by defense secretary william hague , who called the rescue operation norgrove 's " best chance " at survival .
" from the moment they took her , her life was under grave threat .
given who held her , and the danger she was in , we judged that linda 's best chance lay in attempting to rescue her , " hague told parliament after announcing her death on saturday .
norgrove had been active for the us development group dai when she was captured while travelling in kunar province , an area in eastern afghanistan known as a hotbed for taliban activity .

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 11.10.2010 ceo arrested over hungarian toxic sludge crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spillage was described as hungary 's worst ever environmental disaster police have detained the director of the company that owns the reservoir which flooded several towns with toxic red sludge last monday .
but greenpeace has condemned the government 's own handling of the crisis . hungarian police have arrested zoltan bakonyi , ceo of mal rt. , the hungarian aluminum company that owned that plant , and prime minister viktor orban told parliament in budapest that the government must now take over the company and freeze its assets .
the development comes as hundreds of volunteers , disaster-relief teams and engineers race against time to erect a new dam around a reservoir of chemical residue , which authorities fear could crumble if rain arrives as forecast later this week .
the new dam is expected to be completed on monday evening .
up to a million cubic metres of caustic red sludge poured from the waste reservoir of an alumina plant in western hungary a week ago , leaving seven dead and a large area of countryside covered in red sludge .
a five-member eu civil protection team comprising french , belgian , swedish , austrian and german experts has been dispatched to help limit the damage , the european commission said in a statement .
eu chief jose manuel barroso will also visit hungary on tuesday .
barroso is not expected to visit the site of the ecological disaster , but his previously-arranged talks with orban are " timely , " said european commission spokesman olivier bailly .
where to put the mud ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian government faces scrutiny over its handling of the mess the environmental group greenpeace , which measured the chemical content of the mud , said that the desperate efforts to contain the damage and prevent further spillage will be dwarfed by the massive clean-up operation that is yet to begin .
" they ca n't even think about cleaning up at the moment , " bernhard obermayr , greenpeace campaign director for eastern europe , told deutsche welle .
" that will be the big challenge in the next weeks , months , years . "
obermayr expects the operation to take a long time .
" they will have to remove this unbelievable quantity of poisonous mud , as well as contaminated earth , and deposit it somewhere safely , " he said .
" hungary does n't even have the deposit capacity for this quantity of toxic waste . "
since it is still unclear how much of the underlying earth has been contaminated , the extent of the clean-up operation is still pure speculation .
" one million cubic meters is more or less what has already spilled out , and another 500,000 could be added to that , " he said .
" that is an immense quantity .
we 're talking about 40 square kilometers of polluted earth . and we do n't know how deep the contamination is yet .
if it 's a meter rather than half a meter , then obviously that means twice as much earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says the clean-up could take years privatization blamed the hungarian government has been careful to lay the blame for the catastrophe squarely with the operators of the aluminum plant , but obermayr criticized the government 's own response .
" the disaster happened last monday , and we published the results of our tests last friday , " he said .
" until then , the government was silent about the extent to which the people living there were in danger .
they did n't say anything about possible water contamination or even what chemicals we 're dealing with .
that really is very negligent . "
obermayr also said that very serious questions needed to be asked of the company .
" a dam does n't just break , " he said .
" either there was too much sludge in the reservoir , or the dam was not properly maintained .
in either case the owners have a very clear responsibility . "
greenpeace has also laid the blame on hungary 's privatization policy .
" the company purchased the plant very cheaply in 1995 , and have made huge profits from this plant since then , " he said .
" apparently either they did n't adhere to the safety regulations , or they over-burdened the dam in order to maximize the profits . "
greenpeace has also raised questions about the contingency plans for such an emergency .
" we know that the company made no such plans , " said obermayr .
" we ca n't prove whether the hungarian authorities have acted negligently or not .
but no-one comes out of this looking good . "

they cover less than 0.2 percent of the ocean floor but harbor almost a quarter of all marine species .
they 're also a key source of food , income and coastal protection for around 500 million people worldwide .
but the reefs are increasingly at risk .
a 2008 study by the global coral reef monitoring network said that a fifth of the world 's coral reefs have died or been destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coral reefs off papua new guinea are still largely intact however the situation is n't without hope .
in papua new guinea , home to 76 percent of the world 's coral species and 600 types of fish , most reefs are still considered intact and functional .
widely considered a global epicenter of marine biodiversity , the country is part of the so-called coral triangle - an area that includes the tropical marine waters of indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , timor leste and the solomon islands .
" coral reef systems in papua new guinea are still in their pristine condition , therefore it is not too late to save and protect them , " local marine biologist noel wangunu said .
" it is now important that coral reefs are given some protection so that they build up their resilience to withstand impacts . "
extreme heat bleaches coral the biggest risk comes from rising temperatures , with potentially significant impacts on food security and livelihoods in vulnerable coastal communities .
coral reefs are the foundation not only of important fishing industries but also of tourist economies . the effects of climate change are felt more directly in the oceans than on land , even if these impacts are less visible . this year 's extreme heat is putting the world 's coral reefs under severe stress .
" -lrb- global warming -rrb- impacts on coral reefs through ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperatures , driving massive coral bleaching effects , " wangunu said .
but the more immediate causes of coral reef degradation are brought about by local economies and human-driven activities including coastal development , deforestation and unrestricted tourism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-driven activities are largely to blame for the loss of corals " overfishing is a significant threat to reef systems in the pacific , " nicola barnard , acting director of the international coral reef action network , said .
" watershed pollution also affects the region , largely as a result of forest clearance , erosion and inland mining , which is a source of sediments and pollution into reef systems which can smother corals in the near shore .
moreover , urbanization has led to direct clearance of mangroves and has had indirect impacts from solid waste and sewage dumping . " raising awareness experts agree that raising community awareness is the key to conserving corals . " the majority of papua new guineans are yet to fully understand the threats facing the oceans and its consequences on biological diversity , " wanganu said .
" many coastal societies use the sea as a ' supermarket ' to support their daily livelihood .
there is general understanding of the shortage of commercially viable species and the declining biodiversity , but they lack the ability to piece together all these changes and develop management strategies to address these . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coastal communities use the sea as a " supermarket " the survival of the coral reefs depends on the local population learning how to balance its economic needs while respecting the environment .
experts say that conservation concepts need to be better explained to local communities in terms of how they will benefit from their resources .
and involving local communities in any effort to conserve the marine ecosystems is just as important .
“ there is very little in the way of a traditional conservation ethic anywhere in melanesia -lrb- a group of islands in the pacific ocean -rrb- , " simon foale from the australian research council center of excellence for coral reef studies said .
" in the modern context of rapidly burgeoning populations and markets , there is a need for good science communication about the impacts of heavy fishing on population dynamics of reef fisheries which , together with the very rich local knowledge that is present in many communities , can help people come up with their own management solutions . "
global solution needed while coral-rich countries such as papua new guinea explore local solutions to preserve its natural wealth , experts point out that a global approach is the only way to ultimately win the fight to save corals .
the protection of coral reefs and the biodiversity they harbor are now part of international negotiations on curbing climate change .
last year at a meeting in denmark organized by the global legislators organisation for a balanced environment -lrb- globe -rrb- , researchers said that most coral reefs may not survive even if tough regulations on greenhouse gases are put in place .
some experts point out that human behavior too needs to change if the vulnerable ecosystems are to be saved .
" the most important thing we can do for coral reefs is reduce our co2 emissions , ” stephanie wear , director of coral reef conservation at the nature conservancy , an ngo supporting the papua new guinea government 's effort to conserve biodiversity , said .
“ the global community takes its toll .
for example : the choices we make in seafood impact coral reefs .
avoiding coral reef fish on the menu is something that any person can do no matter where they are in the world . "

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .
the panel of three judges handed down a sentence of life in prison for the 38-year-old officer .
korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 11.10.2010 germany coach loew could end ' special relationship ' with podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , is the weak link in a great midfield as germany try to keep their perfect euro 2012 qualification record intact against minnows kazakhstan on tuesday , the mood in the squad is buoyant .
but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .
but klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in poland and ukraine , and it 's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt .
cacau is a different sort of forward , while stefan kiessling is injured long term , and mario gomez seems to have completely lost the plot .
and a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system loew employed to such effect in south africa .
unfortunately for loew , there are n't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the bundesliga .
if that situation does n't change , germany 's embarrassment of riches in midfield might not be enough for loew to achieve his stated aim for 2012 - leading the team to their first major international title since 1996 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 11.10.2010 csu to vote on gender quota for women in leadership roles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebler said the 40-percent quota is only a first step the christian social union of bavaria is one of germany 's most old-school conservative political parties - and it has the lowest rate of female membership .
but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .
big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .

simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 11.10.2010 germany coach loew could end ' special relationship ' with podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , is the weak link in a great midfield as germany try to keep their perfect euro 2012 qualification record intact against minnows kazakhstan on tuesday , the mood in the squad is buoyant .
but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .
but klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in poland and ukraine , and it 's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt .
cacau is a different sort of forward , while stefan kiessling is injured long term , and mario gomez seems to have completely lost the plot .
and a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system loew employed to such effect in south africa .
unfortunately for loew , there are n't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the bundesliga .
if that situation does n't change , germany 's embarrassment of riches in midfield might not be enough for loew to achieve his stated aim for 2012 - leading the team to their first major international title since 1996 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 11.10.2010 ceo arrested over hungarian toxic sludge crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spillage was described as hungary 's worst ever environmental disaster police have detained the director of the company that owns the reservoir which flooded several towns with toxic red sludge last monday .
but greenpeace has condemned the government 's own handling of the crisis . hungarian police have arrested zoltan bakonyi , ceo of mal rt. , the hungarian aluminum company that owned that plant , and prime minister viktor orban told parliament in budapest that the government must now take over the company and freeze its assets .
the development comes as hundreds of volunteers , disaster-relief teams and engineers race against time to erect a new dam around a reservoir of chemical residue , which authorities fear could crumble if rain arrives as forecast later this week .
the new dam is expected to be completed on monday evening .
up to a million cubic metres of caustic red sludge poured from the waste reservoir of an alumina plant in western hungary a week ago , leaving seven dead and a large area of countryside covered in red sludge .
a five-member eu civil protection team comprising french , belgian , swedish , austrian and german experts has been dispatched to help limit the damage , the european commission said in a statement .
eu chief jose manuel barroso will also visit hungary on tuesday .
barroso is not expected to visit the site of the ecological disaster , but his previously-arranged talks with orban are " timely , " said european commission spokesman olivier bailly .
where to put the mud ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian government faces scrutiny over its handling of the mess the environmental group greenpeace , which measured the chemical content of the mud , said that the desperate efforts to contain the damage and prevent further spillage will be dwarfed by the massive clean-up operation that is yet to begin .
" they ca n't even think about cleaning up at the moment , " bernhard obermayr , greenpeace campaign director for eastern europe , told deutsche welle .
" that will be the big challenge in the next weeks , months , years . "
obermayr expects the operation to take a long time .
" they will have to remove this unbelievable quantity of poisonous mud , as well as contaminated earth , and deposit it somewhere safely , " he said .
" hungary does n't even have the deposit capacity for this quantity of toxic waste . "
since it is still unclear how much of the underlying earth has been contaminated , the extent of the clean-up operation is still pure speculation .
" one million cubic meters is more or less what has already spilled out , and another 500,000 could be added to that , " he said .
" that is an immense quantity .
we 're talking about 40 square kilometers of polluted earth . and we do n't know how deep the contamination is yet .
if it 's a meter rather than half a meter , then obviously that means twice as much earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says the clean-up could take years privatization blamed the hungarian government has been careful to lay the blame for the catastrophe squarely with the operators of the aluminum plant , but obermayr criticized the government 's own response .
" the disaster happened last monday , and we published the results of our tests last friday , " he said .
" until then , the government was silent about the extent to which the people living there were in danger .
they did n't say anything about possible water contamination or even what chemicals we 're dealing with .
that really is very negligent . "
obermayr also said that very serious questions needed to be asked of the company .
" a dam does n't just break , " he said .
" either there was too much sludge in the reservoir , or the dam was not properly maintained .
in either case the owners have a very clear responsibility . "
greenpeace has also laid the blame on hungary 's privatization policy .
" the company purchased the plant very cheaply in 1995 , and have made huge profits from this plant since then , " he said .
" apparently either they did n't adhere to the safety regulations , or they over-burdened the dam in order to maximize the profits . "
greenpeace has also raised questions about the contingency plans for such an emergency .
" we know that the company made no such plans , " said obermayr .
" we ca n't prove whether the hungarian authorities have acted negligently or not .
but no-one comes out of this looking good . "

facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .
big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .
" but at the moment , our company in germany is still in its set-up-period . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute in oslo , spoke to deutsche welle about the decision and the reaction . this year 's nobel peace prize has been awarded to detained chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
deutsche welle spoke to geir lundestad about the reactions of the chinese leadership .
deutsche welle : some argue that it is not fair to use the nobel peace prize for political reasons .
but isn ’ t peace itself a political term ?
geir lundestad : peace has certainly something to do with politics .
it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .
and at a time when china has become so important in international affairs , i think these chinese leaders should expect to be held accountable to the treaties they have signed or ratified and to the relevant clauses in their own constitution .

economic growth , he added , is expected to be between 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent . mersch also rejected the notion that that ecb would not be able to continue with an exit from its current accommodative monetary policy if other central banks did not follow .
" we do not at all feel blocked by the path of others , or like a hostage , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 11.10.2010 germany coach loew could end ' special relationship ' with podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , is the weak link in a great midfield as germany try to keep their perfect euro 2012 qualification record intact against minnows kazakhstan on tuesday , the mood in the squad is buoyant .
but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .
but klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in poland and ukraine , and it 's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt .
cacau is a different sort of forward , while stefan kiessling is injured long term , and mario gomez seems to have completely lost the plot .
and a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system loew employed to such effect in south africa .
unfortunately for loew , there are n't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the bundesliga .

dead fish found in hungary 's danube after toxic spill this toxic spill is a reminder to all who benefit from industry that we must demand clean up which protects the environmental future of our children . - anne , canada it is inconceivable to have allowed such an amount of toxic waste to accumulate -lrb- near human habitation and crucial rivers , no less ! -rrb- .
where was the eu when prevention mattered ?
i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .
the villages downstream must be prepared to move to higher ground .
a rental company of trucks could help move materials and the train system could carry the soil to be burned .
gps should be used to send information to a command center and follow the water movement with google earth . - malcolm , canada if hungary is so concerned over the availability of drinkable water , why has it sold the rights to nestle to take water from the kali basin by the thousands of gallons daily ?
this well is only 25 miles or so from the toxic sludge spill .
i question any country 's carelessness that is so willing to sell precious resources such as drinkable water at this time . - emmie , us there is a way to manage river water flow in a way to help minimize the spread and provide ph neutralization .
but i 'll be needed to be heard at the highest levels .
this is europe 's deepwater horizon , in my view . - vivek , india while the results of investigation of the causes of the catastrophe are not yet known , it seem that the mal zrt. company must bear full responsibility for the disaster .
while it is hard to say if the measures taken by hungarian authorities have been the best possible , i am impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of hungarian catastrophe teams .
it is sad to see , however , that some actors of international media are trying to create panic rather than contribute to objective communication . - borisz , hungary of course enough is not being done to prevent a second spill if there are fears of new toxic spill .
now we can barely hear the strauss 's vals " the blue danube , " next month we will hear from a metal band : “ the toxic danube . ”
an apology for this industry is not enough , it must be closed or at least it has to pay all damages to this village or put it them in condition again . - henry , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .
the panel of three judges handed down a sentence of life in prison for the 38-year-old officer .
korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

" the decision was not made lightly , considering the advanced stage of development , " the company 's board chairman andreas barner said in a statement .
originally conceived as an anti-depressant , flibanserin began testing several years ago as a potential libido aid after some women in tests said it failed to help their depression but did boost their sex drive .
the pink-colored pill came to be known as " pink viagra " or " rosa viagra , " and clinical trials to test the drug 's efficacy in raising sexual desire in pre-menopausal women were held in canada , europe and the united states .
but the fda announced in june that in two us trials , in which the drug was compared with a placebo , flibanserin " failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement on the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low libido is the most common sexual disorder in women between 30 and 60 " neither study met the agreed-upon criteria for success in establishing the efficacy of flibanserin for the treatment of hsdd -lrb- hypoactive sexual desire disorder -rrb- , " the administration added .
as well as the poor results , the fda noted that in some patients the drug caused side effects including depression and dizziness .
company still believes in the drug barner said boehringer ingelheim was still convinced of the usefulness of the drug , which was to come on the market under the name " girosa . "
" the company continues to believe in the value that flibanserin would have for women suffering with hsdd , a significant and recognized medical condition which impacts the lives of many women around the world , " boehringer ingelheim said in a statement .
but boehringer ingelheim 's statement added the " complexity " of further questions meant that it had decided to reallocate resources to other projects .
researchers believe lack of desire , or hsdd , is the most common sexual problem in women aged 30 to 60 , just as erectile dysfunction is the most common sexual disorder among men in the same age bracket .
boehringer ingelheim say they will complete their two most advanced clinical studies to add knowledge on hsdd for the scientific community .

merkel said he was misconstrued . german chancellor angela merkel has defended the state premier of bavaria 's controversial call for restrictions to immigration . deputy government spokesperson sabine heimbach said merkel spoke with horst seehofer earlier on monday and that he had explained that his position had been " misrepresented . " he said his call for restrictions on immigrants from turkey or arab countries was directed " merely at skilled laborers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to improve integration merkel expressed her agreement with seehofer with regard to the process of bringing in skilled labor , saying that " existing potential had to be exhausted first " before allowing the influx of foreign skilled labor .
on the heels of merkel 's meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin , in which she reiterated that negotiations for eu membership for turkey remained " open-ended with no guarantees , " seehofer told focus magazine that some groups of immigrants should be excluded from germany . " it is clear that immigrants from foreign cultural circles , like turkey or arab countries , have a hard time , " he told the weekly news magazine focus .
" that leads me to the conclusion that we do not need any more migrants from other cultural circles , " he said . opposition demands apologies the green party 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , accused seehofer of right-wing populism and immediately demanded an apology , which seehofer refused to concede on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer ruffled more than a few feathers with his remarks the social democrat interior minister of the city-state of berlin , ehrhart koerting , accused seehofer of " stigmatizing " certain immigrants and undermining domestic peace . members of merkel 's ruling coalition , made up of the chancellor 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the free market liberals fdp and seehofer 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , also expressed doubts about the bavarian leader 's comments . " the question is whether horst seehofer wants to prevent additional immigration or get around existing law , " the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach told the daily saarbruecker zeitung .
" if it 's the latter , than i have doubts about its constitutionality . " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the fdp , called for a " rational integration and migration policy - not an intentional simplification and populist debate over an end to migration . ongoing debate since august , a debate has been raging in germany after thilo sarrazin , a prominent central banker , who later resigned , said the country was being made " dumber " by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants and their children . german president christian wulff further fanned the flames on october 3 by saying at celebrations marking 20 years of german reunification that islam had become " a part of germany , " earning him sharp rebukes from conservatives . bildunterschrift : most germans take umbrage at the perceived lack of integration by muslim immigrants the state premier of hesse , volker bouffier , rejected wulff 's assessment saying , " islam did not belong to the foundations of our republic , " and that germany did not need to change , but rather the islamic immigrants . a representative survey carried out by the emnid polling institute last week for focus magazine , prior to erdogan 's visit , revealed that 60 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey . in another poll conducted by emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper during the same period , 59 percent believed the large majority of muslims living in germany were unwilling to accept and respect the german constitution . author : gabriel borrud , gregg benzow -lrb- reuters / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one can not look excessively at bilateral exchange rates , " mersch said in an interview with the business newspaper financial times deutschland .
" what is decisive is the effective exchange rate and there in the third quarter we were not above the second quarter . " optimistic about growth mersch also warned about reading too much into the combination of the euro 's rise and rising interbank rates .
" we have a very stimulating monetary policy and we are still providing unlimited equity , " he said .
" this applies all the more so when one sees that provision of credit has all but reached the turning point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets are banking on the euro but exporters are concerned at the same time , mersch spoke optimistically about growth in the eurozone .
" for the third quarter , we indeed have already seen some data in the eurozone that indicates a positive surprise , " he said .
economic growth , he added , is expected to be between 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent . mersch also rejected the notion that that ecb would not be able to continue with an exit from its current accommodative monetary policy if other central banks did not follow .
" we do not at all feel blocked by the path of others , or like a hostage , " he said .

they cover less than 0.2 percent of the ocean floor but harbor almost a quarter of all marine species .
they 're also a key source of food , income and coastal protection for around 500 million people worldwide .
but the reefs are increasingly at risk .
a 2008 study by the global coral reef monitoring network said that a fifth of the world 's coral reefs have died or been destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coral reefs off papua new guinea are still largely intact however the situation is n't without hope .
in papua new guinea , home to 76 percent of the world 's coral species and 600 types of fish , most reefs are still considered intact and functional .
widely considered a global epicenter of marine biodiversity , the country is part of the so-called coral triangle - an area that includes the tropical marine waters of indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , timor leste and the solomon islands .
" coral reef systems in papua new guinea are still in their pristine condition , therefore it is not too late to save and protect them , " local marine biologist noel wangunu said .
" it is now important that coral reefs are given some protection so that they build up their resilience to withstand impacts . "
extreme heat bleaches coral the biggest risk comes from rising temperatures , with potentially significant impacts on food security and livelihoods in vulnerable coastal communities .
coral reefs are the foundation not only of important fishing industries but also of tourist economies . the effects of climate change are felt more directly in the oceans than on land , even if these impacts are less visible . this year 's extreme heat is putting the world 's coral reefs under severe stress .
" -lrb- global warming -rrb- impacts on coral reefs through ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperatures , driving massive coral bleaching effects , " wangunu said .
but the more immediate causes of coral reef degradation are brought about by local economies and human-driven activities including coastal development , deforestation and unrestricted tourism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-driven activities are largely to blame for the loss of corals " overfishing is a significant threat to reef systems in the pacific , " nicola barnard , acting director of the international coral reef action network , said .
" watershed pollution also affects the region , largely as a result of forest clearance , erosion and inland mining , which is a source of sediments and pollution into reef systems which can smother corals in the near shore .
moreover , urbanization has led to direct clearance of mangroves and has had indirect impacts from solid waste and sewage dumping . " raising awareness experts agree that raising community awareness is the key to conserving corals . " the majority of papua new guineans are yet to fully understand the threats facing the oceans and its consequences on biological diversity , " wanganu said .
" many coastal societies use the sea as a ' supermarket ' to support their daily livelihood .
there is general understanding of the shortage of commercially viable species and the declining biodiversity , but they lack the ability to piece together all these changes and develop management strategies to address these . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coastal communities use the sea as a " supermarket " the survival of the coral reefs depends on the local population learning how to balance its economic needs while respecting the environment .
experts say that conservation concepts need to be better explained to local communities in terms of how they will benefit from their resources .
and involving local communities in any effort to conserve the marine ecosystems is just as important .
“ there is very little in the way of a traditional conservation ethic anywhere in melanesia -lrb- a group of islands in the pacific ocean -rrb- , " simon foale from the australian research council center of excellence for coral reef studies said .
" in the modern context of rapidly burgeoning populations and markets , there is a need for good science communication about the impacts of heavy fishing on population dynamics of reef fisheries which , together with the very rich local knowledge that is present in many communities , can help people come up with their own management solutions . "
global solution needed while coral-rich countries such as papua new guinea explore local solutions to preserve its natural wealth , experts point out that a global approach is the only way to ultimately win the fight to save corals .
the protection of coral reefs and the biodiversity they harbor are now part of international negotiations on curbing climate change .
last year at a meeting in denmark organized by the global legislators organisation for a balanced environment -lrb- globe -rrb- , researchers said that most coral reefs may not survive even if tough regulations on greenhouse gases are put in place .
some experts point out that human behavior too needs to change if the vulnerable ecosystems are to be saved .
" the most important thing we can do for coral reefs is reduce our co2 emissions , ” stephanie wear , director of coral reef conservation at the nature conservancy , an ngo supporting the papua new guinea government 's effort to conserve biodiversity , said .
“ the global community takes its toll .
for example : the choices we make in seafood impact coral reefs .
avoiding coral reef fish on the menu is something that any person can do no matter where they are in the world . "

extreme heat bleaches coral the biggest risk comes from rising temperatures , with potentially significant impacts on food security and livelihoods in vulnerable coastal communities .
coral reefs are the foundation not only of important fishing industries but also of tourist economies . the effects of climate change are felt more directly in the oceans than on land , even if these impacts are less visible . this year 's extreme heat is putting the world 's coral reefs under severe stress .
" -lrb- global warming -rrb- impacts on coral reefs through ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperatures , driving massive coral bleaching effects , " wangunu said .
but the more immediate causes of coral reef degradation are brought about by local economies and human-driven activities including coastal development , deforestation and unrestricted tourism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-driven activities are largely to blame for the loss of corals " overfishing is a significant threat to reef systems in the pacific , " nicola barnard , acting director of the international coral reef action network , said .
" watershed pollution also affects the region , largely as a result of forest clearance , erosion and inland mining , which is a source of sediments and pollution into reef systems which can smother corals in the near shore .
moreover , urbanization has led to direct clearance of mangroves and has had indirect impacts from solid waste and sewage dumping . " raising awareness experts agree that raising community awareness is the key to conserving corals . " the majority of papua new guineans are yet to fully understand the threats facing the oceans and its consequences on biological diversity , " wanganu said .
" many coastal societies use the sea as a ' supermarket ' to support their daily livelihood .
there is general understanding of the shortage of commercially viable species and the declining biodiversity , but they lack the ability to piece together all these changes and develop management strategies to address these . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coastal communities use the sea as a " supermarket " the survival of the coral reefs depends on the local population learning how to balance its economic needs while respecting the environment .
experts say that conservation concepts need to be better explained to local communities in terms of how they will benefit from their resources .
and involving local communities in any effort to conserve the marine ecosystems is just as important .
“ there is very little in the way of a traditional conservation ethic anywhere in melanesia -lrb- a group of islands in the pacific ocean -rrb- , " simon foale from the australian research council center of excellence for coral reef studies said .
" in the modern context of rapidly burgeoning populations and markets , there is a need for good science communication about the impacts of heavy fishing on population dynamics of reef fisheries which , together with the very rich local knowledge that is present in many communities , can help people come up with their own management solutions . "
global solution needed while coral-rich countries such as papua new guinea explore local solutions to preserve its natural wealth , experts point out that a global approach is the only way to ultimately win the fight to save corals .
the protection of coral reefs and the biodiversity they harbor are now part of international negotiations on curbing climate change .
last year at a meeting in denmark organized by the global legislators organisation for a balanced environment -lrb- globe -rrb- , researchers said that most coral reefs may not survive even if tough regulations on greenhouse gases are put in place .
some experts point out that human behavior too needs to change if the vulnerable ecosystems are to be saved .
" the most important thing we can do for coral reefs is reduce our co2 emissions , ” stephanie wear , director of coral reef conservation at the nature conservancy , an ngo supporting the papua new guinea government 's effort to conserve biodiversity , said .
“ the global community takes its toll .
for example : the choices we make in seafood impact coral reefs .
avoiding coral reef fish on the menu is something that any person can do no matter where they are in the world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 11.10.2010 csu to vote on gender quota for women in leadership roles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebler said the 40-percent quota is only a first step the christian social union of bavaria is one of germany 's most old-school conservative political parties - and it has the lowest rate of female membership .
but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 11.10.2010 germany launches 2.0 fight against nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists are becoming increasingly savvy on social networks social network platforms in germany have launched a week-long campaign to battle right-wing extremism on the internet .
facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .
big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .
" but at the moment , our company in germany is still in its set-up-period . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .
big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .
" but at the moment , our company in germany is still in its set-up-period . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .
but klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in poland and ukraine , and it 's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt .
cacau is a different sort of forward , while stefan kiessling is injured long term , and mario gomez seems to have completely lost the plot .
and a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system loew employed to such effect in south africa .
unfortunately for loew , there are n't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the bundesliga .
if that situation does n't change , germany 's embarrassment of riches in midfield might not be enough for loew to achieve his stated aim for 2012 - leading the team to their first major international title since 1996 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 11.10.2010 urban artists bring street vibe indoors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spray paint evokes mixed reactions among the general public once clandestine and illegal , street art has gone mainstream in recent years , even making its way into galleries and art fairs .
berlin is particularly fertile ground , say the artists . for decades , urban art forms involving spray cans , stencils and paste-ups have been executed under the cover of darkness .
often merging social commentary with urban beautification , artists needed to work quickly - and stay one step ahead of police and security guards . now , street art is wandering from the alley to the art gallery - thanks to star underground artists like britain 's banksy , who auctioned a piece for 288,000 pounds -lrb- around $ 460,000 -rrb- in 2007 and raised the eyebrows of gallerists the world over . recently in berlin , galleries representing street artists have popped up across the city .
with the significant leap from outdoors to indoors already accomplished , street art fairs were bound to follow - even though these have traditionally been the domain of mainstream art forms .
street art 's answer to basel and venice is stroke.03 , held in berlin this past week . " most of the -lsb- street -rsb- artists represented here ca n't do illegal work , or they do n't want to do illegal work anymore because they can not finish a piece in five minutes without having any lights , " marco schwalbe , a co-founder of stroke.03 , told deutsche welle .
he added that moving into galleries was simply a practical step for many street artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british artist banksy has been instrumental in " legitimizing " street art schwalbe also runs the intoxicated demons urban art gallery in berlin 's alternative kreuzberg district .
as a gallerist , he saw the need for an art fair dedicated to the worldwide phenomenon of urban art and also affordable for smaller up-and-coming galleries . gaining legitimacy indoors and out danish street artist morten andersen , whose work is represented at stroke.03 , learned the art of graffiti as a hip hop-obsessed teenager in the late 1980s .
after spraying illegally for 10 years , he now only works at locations where he has permission , but has also moved indoors to work on canvas . " what i like about painting inside is you can take the raw vibe that you have from the street and put this on a canvas , " he said .
" and you can take this canvas a lot of places .
you can take it to la for a show .
you can take it to berlin for a show .
this you ca n't do with a wall . " while his lines , forms and colors clearly reference his graffiti background , the works themselves are an abstract form of urban expression . emess , a berlin-based stencil artist , appreciates the dialogue that occurs when artists paint in public spaces , rather than on canvases in isolated studios . " something i love about the street is when you put something out there and it 's trashed the next day you know it was n't worth it , " he said , " but if people paint around it , like even house owners painting the facade around your piece - that 's cool . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stencil art - like this work by snik & finbarr - is an alternative to the old-school spray can emess was inspired when he saw figurative works that communicated a message by well-known street artists like banksy and new york-based swoon . " when i saw the first banksy show , i started cutting stencils the next day , " said emess . street art is for everyone compared to many more conservative cities , the street art scene in berlin is more tolerated by both the authorities and the residents , said artist morten andersen . " there 's always been this thing with spray cans .
you know when people see it they feel like , ' shall we call the cops or clap our hands ? " ' said andersen , who added that the hype around artists like banksy has helped legitimize urban art among the general public . but with this sudden hype have come collectors and others wanting to cash in by cutting works by well-known street artists out of fences , gates and sides of buildings in order to sell them for inflated prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroke.03 attracted street artists from around the world , like american chor boogie according to stroke.03 co-founder schwalbe , " if you put something on public property , then somebody might take it .
i think that 's part of the process and i would never sue anybody who 's doing that . " but berlin-based artist emess disagreed .
" it ’ s a little bit like a lawn full of flowers .
if everybody collects one flower , in the end it 's empty , " he explained .
that 's one of the main reasons emess also sells his work in a gallery . " if you really like it , then pay the artist and the gallerist and buy something in a gallery and then you have it , " he said .
" and then you 're supporting the art form and the artist . " author : cinnamon nippard editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .
the panel of three judges handed down a sentence of life in prison for the 38-year-old officer .
korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 11.10.2010 ceo arrested over hungarian toxic sludge crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spillage was described as hungary 's worst ever environmental disaster police have detained the director of the company that owns the reservoir which flooded several towns with toxic red sludge last monday .
but greenpeace has condemned the government 's own handling of the crisis . hungarian police have arrested zoltan bakonyi , ceo of mal rt. , the hungarian aluminum company that owned that plant , and prime minister viktor orban told parliament in budapest that the government must now take over the company and freeze its assets .
the development comes as hundreds of volunteers , disaster-relief teams and engineers race against time to erect a new dam around a reservoir of chemical residue , which authorities fear could crumble if rain arrives as forecast later this week .
the new dam is expected to be completed on monday evening .
up to a million cubic metres of caustic red sludge poured from the waste reservoir of an alumina plant in western hungary a week ago , leaving seven dead and a large area of countryside covered in red sludge .
a five-member eu civil protection team comprising french , belgian , swedish , austrian and german experts has been dispatched to help limit the damage , the european commission said in a statement .
eu chief jose manuel barroso will also visit hungary on tuesday .
barroso is not expected to visit the site of the ecological disaster , but his previously-arranged talks with orban are " timely , " said european commission spokesman olivier bailly .
where to put the mud ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian government faces scrutiny over its handling of the mess the environmental group greenpeace , which measured the chemical content of the mud , said that the desperate efforts to contain the damage and prevent further spillage will be dwarfed by the massive clean-up operation that is yet to begin .
" they ca n't even think about cleaning up at the moment , " bernhard obermayr , greenpeace campaign director for eastern europe , told deutsche welle .
" that will be the big challenge in the next weeks , months , years . "
obermayr expects the operation to take a long time .
" they will have to remove this unbelievable quantity of poisonous mud , as well as contaminated earth , and deposit it somewhere safely , " he said .
" hungary does n't even have the deposit capacity for this quantity of toxic waste . "
since it is still unclear how much of the underlying earth has been contaminated , the extent of the clean-up operation is still pure speculation .
" one million cubic meters is more or less what has already spilled out , and another 500,000 could be added to that , " he said .
" that is an immense quantity .
we 're talking about 40 square kilometers of polluted earth . and we do n't know how deep the contamination is yet .
if it 's a meter rather than half a meter , then obviously that means twice as much earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says the clean-up could take years privatization blamed the hungarian government has been careful to lay the blame for the catastrophe squarely with the operators of the aluminum plant , but obermayr criticized the government 's own response .
" the disaster happened last monday , and we published the results of our tests last friday , " he said .
" until then , the government was silent about the extent to which the people living there were in danger .
they did n't say anything about possible water contamination or even what chemicals we 're dealing with .
that really is very negligent . "
obermayr also said that very serious questions needed to be asked of the company .
" a dam does n't just break , " he said .
" either there was too much sludge in the reservoir , or the dam was not properly maintained .
in either case the owners have a very clear responsibility . "
greenpeace has also laid the blame on hungary 's privatization policy .
" the company purchased the plant very cheaply in 1995 , and have made huge profits from this plant since then , " he said .
" apparently either they did n't adhere to the safety regulations , or they over-burdened the dam in order to maximize the profits . "
greenpeace has also raised questions about the contingency plans for such an emergency .
" we know that the company made no such plans , " said obermayr .
" we ca n't prove whether the hungarian authorities have acted negligently or not .
but no-one comes out of this looking good . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 11.10.2010 csu to vote on gender quota for women in leadership roles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebler said the 40-percent quota is only a first step the christian social union of bavaria is one of germany 's most old-school conservative political parties - and it has the lowest rate of female membership .
but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute in oslo , spoke to deutsche welle about the decision and the reaction . this year 's nobel peace prize has been awarded to detained chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
deutsche welle spoke to geir lundestad about the reactions of the chinese leadership .
deutsche welle : some argue that it is not fair to use the nobel peace prize for political reasons .
but isn ’ t peace itself a political term ?
geir lundestad : peace has certainly something to do with politics .
it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .
and at a time when china has become so important in international affairs , i think these chinese leaders should expect to be held accountable to the treaties they have signed or ratified and to the relevant clauses in their own constitution .

i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .
the villages downstream must be prepared to move to higher ground .
a rental company of trucks could help move materials and the train system could carry the soil to be burned .
gps should be used to send information to a command center and follow the water movement with google earth . - malcolm , canada if hungary is so concerned over the availability of drinkable water , why has it sold the rights to nestle to take water from the kali basin by the thousands of gallons daily ?
this well is only 25 miles or so from the toxic sludge spill .
i question any country 's carelessness that is so willing to sell precious resources such as drinkable water at this time . - emmie , us there is a way to manage river water flow in a way to help minimize the spread and provide ph neutralization .
but i 'll be needed to be heard at the highest levels .
this is europe 's deepwater horizon , in my view . - vivek , india while the results of investigation of the causes of the catastrophe are not yet known , it seem that the mal zrt. company must bear full responsibility for the disaster .
while it is hard to say if the measures taken by hungarian authorities have been the best possible , i am impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of hungarian catastrophe teams .
it is sad to see , however , that some actors of international media are trying to create panic rather than contribute to objective communication . - borisz , hungary of course enough is not being done to prevent a second spill if there are fears of new toxic spill .
now we can barely hear the strauss 's vals " the blue danube , " next month we will hear from a metal band : “ the toxic danube . ”
an apology for this industry is not enough , it must be closed or at least it has to pay all damages to this village or put it them in condition again . - henry , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 11.10.2010 csu to vote on gender quota for women in leadership roles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebler said the 40-percent quota is only a first step the christian social union of bavaria is one of germany 's most old-school conservative political parties - and it has the lowest rate of female membership .
but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

many athletes are from poor families in the northern state of haryana , bordering delhi . a little township 160 kilometers from delhi is often referred to as ' little cuba ' .
bhiwani has become a household name as india 's boxing nursery and has thrown up many boxers and wrestlers who have done well at the olympics .
most of these boxers and wrestlers come from poor families and are children of bus drivers , conductors or marginal farmers .
but the recognition given to these disciplines by the state government has propelled them to do well in international sports .
with the medals coming in thick and fast , these could well turn out to be haryana ’ s commonwealth games .
keys to successs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's vijender singh punches back at the commonwealth games sanjay singh , the son of the legendary indian boxer , captain hawa singh , a two time asian games gold medalist and 11 time national champion , runs a boxing academy in bhiwani . he says the boom of boxers and wrestlers is due to several factors .
" their diet is good , the coaches are sincere and hardworking and this has contributed to the sport .
boxers and wrestlers also get good government jobs and prize money .
so obviously the sport will grow , " he explains .
traditional wrestling ranbir singh mann , a former legislator from haryana , says the reasons have also to do with tradition . since ancient times , people here have been fond of wrestling .
" and because of the hardships and the atmosphere here , they organized melas -lrb- fairs -rrb- where wrestling always took place .
the major game was wrestling , " he adds .
there is no dearth of talent in traditional games in haryana and even in the smallest of the villages of the state , the youth are highly enthusiastic about wrestling .
even female wrestlers from the area have made a mark by starting from the traditional wrestling in mud ' akhadas ' or pits that have traditionally been a male domain .
eating well bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geeta displaying her gold medal in the 55 kg category women 's wrestling contest wrestler geeta , who won india ’ s first gold in the discipline in the 55-kilogram division in the ongoing games , comes from bhiwani .
so do boxers such as vijender singh and akhil kumar , who have also won medals .
there are wrestling pits and boxing rings in many of the over 400 villages in bhiwani .
in every village , talents are encouraged.some also believe athletes from haryana are physically more robust .
many belong to the community of jats , traditionally known for their fearlessness .
joginder singh , a wrestler , explains : " the real reason is we eat well and in time .
milk , butter and yogurt are our staple and that is why we produce such fine wrestlers .
it is the rich home-made food that makes us strong .
we practice a lot and concentrate well . "
attracting investors the popularity of both sports has prompted private companies to build new infrastructure in the last two years , which includes international standard rings and state-of-the-art boxing arenas furnished with adequate facilities .
with more medals expected in the coming days , this tiny state of haryana could well become the pride of the whole country .

but greenpeace has condemned the government 's own handling of the crisis . hungarian police have arrested zoltan bakonyi , ceo of mal rt. , the hungarian aluminum company that owned that plant , and prime minister viktor orban told parliament in budapest that the government must now take over the company and freeze its assets .
the development comes as hundreds of volunteers , disaster-relief teams and engineers race against time to erect a new dam around a reservoir of chemical residue , which authorities fear could crumble if rain arrives as forecast later this week .
the new dam is expected to be completed on monday evening .
up to a million cubic metres of caustic red sludge poured from the waste reservoir of an alumina plant in western hungary a week ago , leaving seven dead and a large area of countryside covered in red sludge .
a five-member eu civil protection team comprising french , belgian , swedish , austrian and german experts has been dispatched to help limit the damage , the european commission said in a statement .
eu chief jose manuel barroso will also visit hungary on tuesday .
barroso is not expected to visit the site of the ecological disaster , but his previously-arranged talks with orban are " timely , " said european commission spokesman olivier bailly .
where to put the mud ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian government faces scrutiny over its handling of the mess the environmental group greenpeace , which measured the chemical content of the mud , said that the desperate efforts to contain the damage and prevent further spillage will be dwarfed by the massive clean-up operation that is yet to begin .
" they ca n't even think about cleaning up at the moment , " bernhard obermayr , greenpeace campaign director for eastern europe , told deutsche welle .
" that will be the big challenge in the next weeks , months , years . "
obermayr expects the operation to take a long time .
" they will have to remove this unbelievable quantity of poisonous mud , as well as contaminated earth , and deposit it somewhere safely , " he said .
" hungary does n't even have the deposit capacity for this quantity of toxic waste . "
since it is still unclear how much of the underlying earth has been contaminated , the extent of the clean-up operation is still pure speculation .
" one million cubic meters is more or less what has already spilled out , and another 500,000 could be added to that , " he said .
" that is an immense quantity .
we 're talking about 40 square kilometers of polluted earth . and we do n't know how deep the contamination is yet .
if it 's a meter rather than half a meter , then obviously that means twice as much earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says the clean-up could take years privatization blamed the hungarian government has been careful to lay the blame for the catastrophe squarely with the operators of the aluminum plant , but obermayr criticized the government 's own response .
" the disaster happened last monday , and we published the results of our tests last friday , " he said .
" until then , the government was silent about the extent to which the people living there were in danger .
they did n't say anything about possible water contamination or even what chemicals we 're dealing with .
that really is very negligent . "
obermayr also said that very serious questions needed to be asked of the company .
" a dam does n't just break , " he said .
" either there was too much sludge in the reservoir , or the dam was not properly maintained .
in either case the owners have a very clear responsibility . "
greenpeace has also laid the blame on hungary 's privatization policy .
" the company purchased the plant very cheaply in 1995 , and have made huge profits from this plant since then , " he said .
" apparently either they did n't adhere to the safety regulations , or they over-burdened the dam in order to maximize the profits . "
greenpeace has also raised questions about the contingency plans for such an emergency .
" we know that the company made no such plans , " said obermayr .
" we ca n't prove whether the hungarian authorities have acted negligently or not .
but no-one comes out of this looking good . "

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets are banking on the euro but exporters are concerned at the same time , mersch spoke optimistically about growth in the eurozone .

economic growth , he added , is expected to be between 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent . mersch also rejected the notion that that ecb would not be able to continue with an exit from its current accommodative monetary policy if other central banks did not follow .
" we do not at all feel blocked by the path of others , or like a hostage , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 11.10.2010 urban artists bring street vibe indoors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spray paint evokes mixed reactions among the general public once clandestine and illegal , street art has gone mainstream in recent years , even making its way into galleries and art fairs .
berlin is particularly fertile ground , say the artists . for decades , urban art forms involving spray cans , stencils and paste-ups have been executed under the cover of darkness .
often merging social commentary with urban beautification , artists needed to work quickly - and stay one step ahead of police and security guards . now , street art is wandering from the alley to the art gallery - thanks to star underground artists like britain 's banksy , who auctioned a piece for 288,000 pounds -lrb- around $ 460,000 -rrb- in 2007 and raised the eyebrows of gallerists the world over . recently in berlin , galleries representing street artists have popped up across the city .
with the significant leap from outdoors to indoors already accomplished , street art fairs were bound to follow - even though these have traditionally been the domain of mainstream art forms .
street art 's answer to basel and venice is stroke.03 , held in berlin this past week . " most of the -lsb- street -rsb- artists represented here ca n't do illegal work , or they do n't want to do illegal work anymore because they can not finish a piece in five minutes without having any lights , " marco schwalbe , a co-founder of stroke.03 , told deutsche welle .
he added that moving into galleries was simply a practical step for many street artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british artist banksy has been instrumental in " legitimizing " street art schwalbe also runs the intoxicated demons urban art gallery in berlin 's alternative kreuzberg district .
as a gallerist , he saw the need for an art fair dedicated to the worldwide phenomenon of urban art and also affordable for smaller up-and-coming galleries . gaining legitimacy indoors and out danish street artist morten andersen , whose work is represented at stroke.03 , learned the art of graffiti as a hip hop-obsessed teenager in the late 1980s .
after spraying illegally for 10 years , he now only works at locations where he has permission , but has also moved indoors to work on canvas . " what i like about painting inside is you can take the raw vibe that you have from the street and put this on a canvas , " he said .
" and you can take this canvas a lot of places .
you can take it to la for a show .
you can take it to berlin for a show .
this you ca n't do with a wall . " while his lines , forms and colors clearly reference his graffiti background , the works themselves are an abstract form of urban expression . emess , a berlin-based stencil artist , appreciates the dialogue that occurs when artists paint in public spaces , rather than on canvases in isolated studios . " something i love about the street is when you put something out there and it 's trashed the next day you know it was n't worth it , " he said , " but if people paint around it , like even house owners painting the facade around your piece - that 's cool . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stencil art - like this work by snik & finbarr - is an alternative to the old-school spray can emess was inspired when he saw figurative works that communicated a message by well-known street artists like banksy and new york-based swoon . " when i saw the first banksy show , i started cutting stencils the next day , " said emess . street art is for everyone compared to many more conservative cities , the street art scene in berlin is more tolerated by both the authorities and the residents , said artist morten andersen . " there 's always been this thing with spray cans .
you know when people see it they feel like , ' shall we call the cops or clap our hands ? " ' said andersen , who added that the hype around artists like banksy has helped legitimize urban art among the general public . but with this sudden hype have come collectors and others wanting to cash in by cutting works by well-known street artists out of fences , gates and sides of buildings in order to sell them for inflated prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroke.03 attracted street artists from around the world , like american chor boogie according to stroke.03 co-founder schwalbe , " if you put something on public property , then somebody might take it .
i think that 's part of the process and i would never sue anybody who 's doing that . " but berlin-based artist emess disagreed .
" it ’ s a little bit like a lawn full of flowers .
if everybody collects one flower , in the end it 's empty , " he explained .
that 's one of the main reasons emess also sells his work in a gallery . " if you really like it , then pay the artist and the gallerist and buy something in a gallery and then you have it , " he said .
" and then you 're supporting the art form and the artist . " author : cinnamon nippard editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .
the panel of three judges handed down a sentence of life in prison for the 38-year-old officer .
korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

cities like duesseldorf and cologne , the two leading cities in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , are eager to show investors from india that they are most welcome .
they have promised that indian businessmen never have to wait longer than four weeks to obtain residence and work permits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's cheapest car ' nano ' by tata motors this policy seems to have paid off .
about 100 indian companies are based in germany 's most populous state .
90 percent of these have been acquired in recent years from german owners .
tapan chattopadhyay , the head of the indian business delegation , says that germany with its state-of-the-art technology can help indian companies enormously " in fact a lot of indian companies have invested in germany .
to be precise : tata and other leading industrialists have opted for germany , " he explains . german-indian technology transfer for the last 15 years india 's industry has been contributing 17 percent to the country 's gross domestic product .
in order to increase this share , the country is partnering with key industrial nations around the world . but there is another reason why indian politicians and business leaders are especially attracted to europe 's largest economic power .
apart from the technology transfer germany can help indian companies in upgrading knowledge .

for example , when india 's famous low-cost car , the tata nano , was developed , 35 german suppliers and technology partners were involved .
and they make money on each unit sold . india emerging economic world power according to matter , people in germany should take india seriously as an emerging economic world power .
but he adds that they should not panic when indian companies take over german firms . " due to the global financial crisis , many german companies were undervalued in 2009 .
and indian businessmen were clever enough to take the opportunity and buy into the german industrial sector .

facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .
big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .
" but at the moment , our company in germany is still in its set-up-period . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .

korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

deutsche welle spoke to geir lundestad about the reactions of the chinese leadership .
deutsche welle : some argue that it is not fair to use the nobel peace prize for political reasons .
but isn ’ t peace itself a political term ?
geir lundestad : peace has certainly something to do with politics .
it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .
and at a time when china has become so important in international affairs , i think these chinese leaders should expect to be held accountable to the treaties they have signed or ratified and to the relevant clauses in their own constitution .

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .
the panel of three judges handed down a sentence of life in prison for the 38-year-old officer .
korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
dead fish found in hungary 's danube after toxic spill this toxic spill is a reminder to all who benefit from industry that we must demand clean up which protects the environmental future of our children . - anne , canada it is inconceivable to have allowed such an amount of toxic waste to accumulate -lrb- near human habitation and crucial rivers , no less ! -rrb- .
where was the eu when prevention mattered ?
i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .
the villages downstream must be prepared to move to higher ground .
a rental company of trucks could help move materials and the train system could carry the soil to be burned .
gps should be used to send information to a command center and follow the water movement with google earth . - malcolm , canada if hungary is so concerned over the availability of drinkable water , why has it sold the rights to nestle to take water from the kali basin by the thousands of gallons daily ?
this well is only 25 miles or so from the toxic sludge spill .
i question any country 's carelessness that is so willing to sell precious resources such as drinkable water at this time . - emmie , us there is a way to manage river water flow in a way to help minimize the spread and provide ph neutralization .
but i 'll be needed to be heard at the highest levels .
this is europe 's deepwater horizon , in my view . - vivek , india while the results of investigation of the causes of the catastrophe are not yet known , it seem that the mal zrt. company must bear full responsibility for the disaster .
while it is hard to say if the measures taken by hungarian authorities have been the best possible , i am impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of hungarian catastrophe teams .
it is sad to see , however , that some actors of international media are trying to create panic rather than contribute to objective communication . - borisz , hungary of course enough is not being done to prevent a second spill if there are fears of new toxic spill .
now we can barely hear the strauss 's vals " the blue danube , " next month we will hear from a metal band : “ the toxic danube . ”
an apology for this industry is not enough , it must be closed or at least it has to pay all damages to this village or put it them in condition again . - henry , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de hungary declares state of emergency over toxic spill hungary has declared a state of emergency in three counties over a toxic sludge spill that has killed at least four people and injured more than 100 others .

facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .

big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .

according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .
big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .
" but at the moment , our company in germany is still in its set-up-period . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 11.10.2010 writing overcomes the limits of this brutal world , says book prize winner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melinda nadj abonji does n't write in her native language born to a hungarian-speaking family in a serbian part of the former yugoslavia , melinda nadj abonji moved to switzerland when she was a young child .
her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the decision was not made lightly , considering the advanced stage of development , " the company 's board chairman andreas barner said in a statement .
originally conceived as an anti-depressant , flibanserin began testing several years ago as a potential libido aid after some women in tests said it failed to help their depression but did boost their sex drive .
the pink-colored pill came to be known as " pink viagra " or " rosa viagra , " and clinical trials to test the drug 's efficacy in raising sexual desire in pre-menopausal women were held in canada , europe and the united states .

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .

do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .
the panel of three judges handed down a sentence of life in prison for the 38-year-old officer .
korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 11.10.2010 german ' viagra for women ' gets shelved großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pink pill failed to thrill in scientific tests a us health authority decision prompted the german pharmaceutical company boehringer ingelheim to stop the development of the drug flibanserin , designed to stimulate sex drive in women . germany 's second-biggest pharmaceutical firm boehringer ingelheim announced friday that it was halting the development of its sexual stimulant flibanserin , after the us food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- found little evidence that it worked .
" the decision was not made lightly , considering the advanced stage of development , " the company 's board chairman andreas barner said in a statement .
originally conceived as an anti-depressant , flibanserin began testing several years ago as a potential libido aid after some women in tests said it failed to help their depression but did boost their sex drive .
the pink-colored pill came to be known as " pink viagra " or " rosa viagra , " and clinical trials to test the drug 's efficacy in raising sexual desire in pre-menopausal women were held in canada , europe and the united states .
but the fda announced in june that in two us trials , in which the drug was compared with a placebo , flibanserin " failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement on the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low libido is the most common sexual disorder in women between 30 and 60 " neither study met the agreed-upon criteria for success in establishing the efficacy of flibanserin for the treatment of hsdd -lrb- hypoactive sexual desire disorder -rrb- , " the administration added .
as well as the poor results , the fda noted that in some patients the drug caused side effects including depression and dizziness .
company still believes in the drug barner said boehringer ingelheim was still convinced of the usefulness of the drug , which was to come on the market under the name " girosa . "
" the company continues to believe in the value that flibanserin would have for women suffering with hsdd , a significant and recognized medical condition which impacts the lives of many women around the world , " boehringer ingelheim said in a statement .
but boehringer ingelheim 's statement added the " complexity " of further questions meant that it had decided to reallocate resources to other projects .
researchers believe lack of desire , or hsdd , is the most common sexual problem in women aged 30 to 60 , just as erectile dysfunction is the most common sexual disorder among men in the same age bracket .
boehringer ingelheim say they will complete their two most advanced clinical studies to add knowledge on hsdd for the scientific community .

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" linda could have died as a result of a grenade detonated by the task force during the result , " cameron told a news conference in london .
he said that the top us commander in afghanistan , general david petraeus , had contacted him earlier on monday to inform him that after a review of the incident new information had come to light with regard to the circumstances of norgrove 's death .
" general petraeus told me that -lsb- the review -rsb- had revealed evidence to indicate that linda may not have died at the hands of her captors as originally believed . "
the announcement came a day after a british government official said norgrove was likely killed by a suicide vest held by one of the kidnappers .
no mention was made of her death being caused by the troops involved in the rescue operation .
captors ' ultimately responsible ' cameron said a us-uk investigation would be launched into the affair immediately but made it clear that his intent was not to incriminate any soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunar province is notorious for taliban activity " we should also remember that , ultimately , the responsibility for linda 's death lies with those who took her hostage .
the us forces placed their own lives in danger .
i want to thank them for their courage . "
cameron 's words were echoed by defense secretary william hague , who called the rescue operation norgrove 's " best chance " at survival .
" from the moment they took her , her life was under grave threat .
given who held her , and the danger she was in , we judged that linda 's best chance lay in attempting to rescue her , " hague told parliament after announcing her death on saturday .
norgrove had been active for the us development group dai when she was captured while travelling in kunar province , an area in eastern afghanistan known as a hotbed for taliban activity .

where was the eu when prevention mattered ?
i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .

geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute in oslo , spoke to deutsche welle about the decision and the reaction . this year 's nobel peace prize has been awarded to detained chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
deutsche welle spoke to geir lundestad about the reactions of the chinese leadership .
deutsche welle : some argue that it is not fair to use the nobel peace prize for political reasons .
but isn ’ t peace itself a political term ?
geir lundestad : peace has certainly something to do with politics .
it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .
and at a time when china has become so important in international affairs , i think these chinese leaders should expect to be held accountable to the treaties they have signed or ratified and to the relevant clauses in their own constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 11.10.2010 germany coach loew could end ' special relationship ' with podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , is the weak link in a great midfield as germany try to keep their perfect euro 2012 qualification record intact against minnows kazakhstan on tuesday , the mood in the squad is buoyant .
but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .

but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .
but klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in poland and ukraine , and it 's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt .
cacau is a different sort of forward , while stefan kiessling is injured long term , and mario gomez seems to have completely lost the plot .
and a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system loew employed to such effect in south africa .
unfortunately for loew , there are n't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the bundesliga .
if that situation does n't change , germany 's embarrassment of riches in midfield might not be enough for loew to achieve his stated aim for 2012 - leading the team to their first major international title since 1996 .

making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .
but klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in poland and ukraine , and it 's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt .
cacau is a different sort of forward , while stefan kiessling is injured long term , and mario gomez seems to have completely lost the plot .
and a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system loew employed to such effect in south africa .
unfortunately for loew , there are n't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the bundesliga .
if that situation does n't change , germany 's embarrassment of riches in midfield might not be enough for loew to achieve his stated aim for 2012 - leading the team to their first major international title since 1996 .

but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .

they cover less than 0.2 percent of the ocean floor but harbor almost a quarter of all marine species .
they 're also a key source of food , income and coastal protection for around 500 million people worldwide .
but the reefs are increasingly at risk .
a 2008 study by the global coral reef monitoring network said that a fifth of the world 's coral reefs have died or been destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coral reefs off papua new guinea are still largely intact however the situation is n't without hope .
in papua new guinea , home to 76 percent of the world 's coral species and 600 types of fish , most reefs are still considered intact and functional .
widely considered a global epicenter of marine biodiversity , the country is part of the so-called coral triangle - an area that includes the tropical marine waters of indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , timor leste and the solomon islands .
" coral reef systems in papua new guinea are still in their pristine condition , therefore it is not too late to save and protect them , " local marine biologist noel wangunu said .
" it is now important that coral reefs are given some protection so that they build up their resilience to withstand impacts . "
extreme heat bleaches coral the biggest risk comes from rising temperatures , with potentially significant impacts on food security and livelihoods in vulnerable coastal communities .
coral reefs are the foundation not only of important fishing industries but also of tourist economies . the effects of climate change are felt more directly in the oceans than on land , even if these impacts are less visible . this year 's extreme heat is putting the world 's coral reefs under severe stress .
" -lrb- global warming -rrb- impacts on coral reefs through ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperatures , driving massive coral bleaching effects , " wangunu said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-driven activities are largely to blame for the loss of corals " overfishing is a significant threat to reef systems in the pacific , " nicola barnard , acting director of the international coral reef action network , said .
" watershed pollution also affects the region , largely as a result of forest clearance , erosion and inland mining , which is a source of sediments and pollution into reef systems which can smother corals in the near shore .
moreover , urbanization has led to direct clearance of mangroves and has had indirect impacts from solid waste and sewage dumping . " raising awareness experts agree that raising community awareness is the key to conserving corals . " the majority of papua new guineans are yet to fully understand the threats facing the oceans and its consequences on biological diversity , " wanganu said .
" many coastal societies use the sea as a ' supermarket ' to support their daily livelihood .
there is general understanding of the shortage of commercially viable species and the declining biodiversity , but they lack the ability to piece together all these changes and develop management strategies to address these . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coastal communities use the sea as a " supermarket " the survival of the coral reefs depends on the local population learning how to balance its economic needs while respecting the environment .
experts say that conservation concepts need to be better explained to local communities in terms of how they will benefit from their resources .
and involving local communities in any effort to conserve the marine ecosystems is just as important .
“ there is very little in the way of a traditional conservation ethic anywhere in melanesia -lrb- a group of islands in the pacific ocean -rrb- , " simon foale from the australian research council center of excellence for coral reef studies said .
" in the modern context of rapidly burgeoning populations and markets , there is a need for good science communication about the impacts of heavy fishing on population dynamics of reef fisheries which , together with the very rich local knowledge that is present in many communities , can help people come up with their own management solutions .

they cover less than 0.2 percent of the ocean floor but harbor almost a quarter of all marine species .
they 're also a key source of food , income and coastal protection for around 500 million people worldwide .
but the reefs are increasingly at risk .
a 2008 study by the global coral reef monitoring network said that a fifth of the world 's coral reefs have died or been destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coral reefs off papua new guinea are still largely intact however the situation is n't without hope .
in papua new guinea , home to 76 percent of the world 's coral species and 600 types of fish , most reefs are still considered intact and functional .
widely considered a global epicenter of marine biodiversity , the country is part of the so-called coral triangle - an area that includes the tropical marine waters of indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , timor leste and the solomon islands .
" coral reef systems in papua new guinea are still in their pristine condition , therefore it is not too late to save and protect them , " local marine biologist noel wangunu said .
" it is now important that coral reefs are given some protection so that they build up their resilience to withstand impacts . "
extreme heat bleaches coral the biggest risk comes from rising temperatures , with potentially significant impacts on food security and livelihoods in vulnerable coastal communities .
coral reefs are the foundation not only of important fishing industries but also of tourist economies . the effects of climate change are felt more directly in the oceans than on land , even if these impacts are less visible . this year 's extreme heat is putting the world 's coral reefs under severe stress .
" -lrb- global warming -rrb- impacts on coral reefs through ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperatures , driving massive coral bleaching effects , " wangunu said .
but the more immediate causes of coral reef degradation are brought about by local economies and human-driven activities including coastal development , deforestation and unrestricted tourism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-driven activities are largely to blame for the loss of corals " overfishing is a significant threat to reef systems in the pacific , " nicola barnard , acting director of the international coral reef action network , said .
" watershed pollution also affects the region , largely as a result of forest clearance , erosion and inland mining , which is a source of sediments and pollution into reef systems which can smother corals in the near shore .
moreover , urbanization has led to direct clearance of mangroves and has had indirect impacts from solid waste and sewage dumping . " raising awareness experts agree that raising community awareness is the key to conserving corals . " the majority of papua new guineans are yet to fully understand the threats facing the oceans and its consequences on biological diversity , " wanganu said .
" many coastal societies use the sea as a ' supermarket ' to support their daily livelihood .
there is general understanding of the shortage of commercially viable species and the declining biodiversity , but they lack the ability to piece together all these changes and develop management strategies to address these . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coastal communities use the sea as a " supermarket " the survival of the coral reefs depends on the local population learning how to balance its economic needs while respecting the environment .
experts say that conservation concepts need to be better explained to local communities in terms of how they will benefit from their resources .
and involving local communities in any effort to conserve the marine ecosystems is just as important .
“ there is very little in the way of a traditional conservation ethic anywhere in melanesia -lrb- a group of islands in the pacific ocean -rrb- , " simon foale from the australian research council center of excellence for coral reef studies said .
" in the modern context of rapidly burgeoning populations and markets , there is a need for good science communication about the impacts of heavy fishing on population dynamics of reef fisheries which , together with the very rich local knowledge that is present in many communities , can help people come up with their own management solutions . "
global solution needed while coral-rich countries such as papua new guinea explore local solutions to preserve its natural wealth , experts point out that a global approach is the only way to ultimately win the fight to save corals .
the protection of coral reefs and the biodiversity they harbor are now part of international negotiations on curbing climate change .
last year at a meeting in denmark organized by the global legislators organisation for a balanced environment -lrb- globe -rrb- , researchers said that most coral reefs may not survive even if tough regulations on greenhouse gases are put in place .
some experts point out that human behavior too needs to change if the vulnerable ecosystems are to be saved .
" the most important thing we can do for coral reefs is reduce our co2 emissions , ” stephanie wear , director of coral reef conservation at the nature conservancy , an ngo supporting the papua new guinea government 's effort to conserve biodiversity , said .
“ the global community takes its toll .
for example : the choices we make in seafood impact coral reefs .
avoiding coral reef fish on the menu is something that any person can do no matter where they are in the world . "

dead fish found in hungary 's danube after toxic spill this toxic spill is a reminder to all who benefit from industry that we must demand clean up which protects the environmental future of our children . - anne , canada it is inconceivable to have allowed such an amount of toxic waste to accumulate -lrb- near human habitation and crucial rivers , no less ! -rrb- .
where was the eu when prevention mattered ?
i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .
the villages downstream must be prepared to move to higher ground .
a rental company of trucks could help move materials and the train system could carry the soil to be burned .
gps should be used to send information to a command center and follow the water movement with google earth . - malcolm , canada if hungary is so concerned over the availability of drinkable water , why has it sold the rights to nestle to take water from the kali basin by the thousands of gallons daily ?
this well is only 25 miles or so from the toxic sludge spill .
i question any country 's carelessness that is so willing to sell precious resources such as drinkable water at this time . - emmie , us there is a way to manage river water flow in a way to help minimize the spread and provide ph neutralization .
but i 'll be needed to be heard at the highest levels .
this is europe 's deepwater horizon , in my view . - vivek , india while the results of investigation of the causes of the catastrophe are not yet known , it seem that the mal zrt. company must bear full responsibility for the disaster .
while it is hard to say if the measures taken by hungarian authorities have been the best possible , i am impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of hungarian catastrophe teams .
it is sad to see , however , that some actors of international media are trying to create panic rather than contribute to objective communication . - borisz , hungary of course enough is not being done to prevent a second spill if there are fears of new toxic spill .
now we can barely hear the strauss 's vals " the blue danube , " next month we will hear from a metal band : “ the toxic danube . ”
an apology for this industry is not enough , it must be closed or at least it has to pay all damages to this village or put it them in condition again . - henry , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but isn ’ t peace itself a political term ?
geir lundestad : peace has certainly something to do with politics .
it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .
and at a time when china has become so important in international affairs , i think these chinese leaders should expect to be held accountable to the treaties they have signed or ratified and to the relevant clauses in their own constitution .

geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute in oslo , spoke to deutsche welle about the decision and the reaction . this year 's nobel peace prize has been awarded to detained chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
deutsche welle spoke to geir lundestad about the reactions of the chinese leadership .
deutsche welle : some argue that it is not fair to use the nobel peace prize for political reasons .
but isn ’ t peace itself a political term ?
geir lundestad : peace has certainly something to do with politics .
it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .
and at a time when china has become so important in international affairs , i think these chinese leaders should expect to be held accountable to the treaties they have signed or ratified and to the relevant clauses in their own constitution .

merkel said he was misconstrued . german chancellor angela merkel has defended the state premier of bavaria 's controversial call for restrictions to immigration . deputy government spokesperson sabine heimbach said merkel spoke with horst seehofer earlier on monday and that he had explained that his position had been " misrepresented . " he said his call for restrictions on immigrants from turkey or arab countries was directed " merely at skilled laborers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to improve integration merkel expressed her agreement with seehofer with regard to the process of bringing in skilled labor , saying that " existing potential had to be exhausted first " before allowing the influx of foreign skilled labor .
on the heels of merkel 's meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin , in which she reiterated that negotiations for eu membership for turkey remained " open-ended with no guarantees , " seehofer told focus magazine that some groups of immigrants should be excluded from germany . " it is clear that immigrants from foreign cultural circles , like turkey or arab countries , have a hard time , " he told the weekly news magazine focus .
" that leads me to the conclusion that we do not need any more migrants from other cultural circles , " he said . opposition demands apologies the green party 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , accused seehofer of right-wing populism and immediately demanded an apology , which seehofer refused to concede on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer ruffled more than a few feathers with his remarks the social democrat interior minister of the city-state of berlin , ehrhart koerting , accused seehofer of " stigmatizing " certain immigrants and undermining domestic peace . members of merkel 's ruling coalition , made up of the chancellor 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the free market liberals fdp and seehofer 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , also expressed doubts about the bavarian leader 's comments . " the question is whether horst seehofer wants to prevent additional immigration or get around existing law , " the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach told the daily saarbruecker zeitung .
" if it 's the latter , than i have doubts about its constitutionality . " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the fdp , called for a " rational integration and migration policy - not an intentional simplification and populist debate over an end to migration . ongoing debate since august , a debate has been raging in germany after thilo sarrazin , a prominent central banker , who later resigned , said the country was being made " dumber " by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants and their children . german president christian wulff further fanned the flames on october 3 by saying at celebrations marking 20 years of german reunification that islam had become " a part of germany , " earning him sharp rebukes from conservatives . bildunterschrift : most germans take umbrage at the perceived lack of integration by muslim immigrants the state premier of hesse , volker bouffier , rejected wulff 's assessment saying , " islam did not belong to the foundations of our republic , " and that germany did not need to change , but rather the islamic immigrants . a representative survey carried out by the emnid polling institute last week for focus magazine , prior to erdogan 's visit , revealed that 60 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey . in another poll conducted by emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper during the same period , 59 percent believed the large majority of muslims living in germany were unwilling to accept and respect the german constitution . author : gabriel borrud , gregg benzow -lrb- reuters / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 11.10.2010 ceo arrested over hungarian toxic sludge crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spillage was described as hungary 's worst ever environmental disaster police have detained the director of the company that owns the reservoir which flooded several towns with toxic red sludge last monday .
but greenpeace has condemned the government 's own handling of the crisis . hungarian police have arrested zoltan bakonyi , ceo of mal rt. , the hungarian aluminum company that owned that plant , and prime minister viktor orban told parliament in budapest that the government must now take over the company and freeze its assets .
the development comes as hundreds of volunteers , disaster-relief teams and engineers race against time to erect a new dam around a reservoir of chemical residue , which authorities fear could crumble if rain arrives as forecast later this week .
the new dam is expected to be completed on monday evening .
up to a million cubic metres of caustic red sludge poured from the waste reservoir of an alumina plant in western hungary a week ago , leaving seven dead and a large area of countryside covered in red sludge .
a five-member eu civil protection team comprising french , belgian , swedish , austrian and german experts has been dispatched to help limit the damage , the european commission said in a statement .
eu chief jose manuel barroso will also visit hungary on tuesday .
barroso is not expected to visit the site of the ecological disaster , but his previously-arranged talks with orban are " timely , " said european commission spokesman olivier bailly .
where to put the mud ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian government faces scrutiny over its handling of the mess the environmental group greenpeace , which measured the chemical content of the mud , said that the desperate efforts to contain the damage and prevent further spillage will be dwarfed by the massive clean-up operation that is yet to begin .
" they ca n't even think about cleaning up at the moment , " bernhard obermayr , greenpeace campaign director for eastern europe , told deutsche welle .
" that will be the big challenge in the next weeks , months , years . "
obermayr expects the operation to take a long time .
" they will have to remove this unbelievable quantity of poisonous mud , as well as contaminated earth , and deposit it somewhere safely , " he said .
" hungary does n't even have the deposit capacity for this quantity of toxic waste . "
since it is still unclear how much of the underlying earth has been contaminated , the extent of the clean-up operation is still pure speculation .
" one million cubic meters is more or less what has already spilled out , and another 500,000 could be added to that , " he said .
" that is an immense quantity .
we 're talking about 40 square kilometers of polluted earth . and we do n't know how deep the contamination is yet .
if it 's a meter rather than half a meter , then obviously that means twice as much earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says the clean-up could take years privatization blamed the hungarian government has been careful to lay the blame for the catastrophe squarely with the operators of the aluminum plant , but obermayr criticized the government 's own response .
" the disaster happened last monday , and we published the results of our tests last friday , " he said .
" until then , the government was silent about the extent to which the people living there were in danger .
they did n't say anything about possible water contamination or even what chemicals we 're dealing with .
that really is very negligent . "
obermayr also said that very serious questions needed to be asked of the company .
" a dam does n't just break , " he said .
" either there was too much sludge in the reservoir , or the dam was not properly maintained .
in either case the owners have a very clear responsibility . "
greenpeace has also laid the blame on hungary 's privatization policy .
" the company purchased the plant very cheaply in 1995 , and have made huge profits from this plant since then , " he said .
" apparently either they did n't adhere to the safety regulations , or they over-burdened the dam in order to maximize the profits . "
greenpeace has also raised questions about the contingency plans for such an emergency .
" we know that the company made no such plans , " said obermayr .
" we ca n't prove whether the hungarian authorities have acted negligently or not .

but greenpeace has condemned the government 's own handling of the crisis . hungarian police have arrested zoltan bakonyi , ceo of mal rt. , the hungarian aluminum company that owned that plant , and prime minister viktor orban told parliament in budapest that the government must now take over the company and freeze its assets .
the development comes as hundreds of volunteers , disaster-relief teams and engineers race against time to erect a new dam around a reservoir of chemical residue , which authorities fear could crumble if rain arrives as forecast later this week .
the new dam is expected to be completed on monday evening .
up to a million cubic metres of caustic red sludge poured from the waste reservoir of an alumina plant in western hungary a week ago , leaving seven dead and a large area of countryside covered in red sludge .
a five-member eu civil protection team comprising french , belgian , swedish , austrian and german experts has been dispatched to help limit the damage , the european commission said in a statement .
eu chief jose manuel barroso will also visit hungary on tuesday .
barroso is not expected to visit the site of the ecological disaster , but his previously-arranged talks with orban are " timely , " said european commission spokesman olivier bailly .
where to put the mud ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian government faces scrutiny over its handling of the mess the environmental group greenpeace , which measured the chemical content of the mud , said that the desperate efforts to contain the damage and prevent further spillage will be dwarfed by the massive clean-up operation that is yet to begin .
" they ca n't even think about cleaning up at the moment , " bernhard obermayr , greenpeace campaign director for eastern europe , told deutsche welle .
" that will be the big challenge in the next weeks , months , years . "
obermayr expects the operation to take a long time .
" they will have to remove this unbelievable quantity of poisonous mud , as well as contaminated earth , and deposit it somewhere safely , " he said .
" hungary does n't even have the deposit capacity for this quantity of toxic waste . "
since it is still unclear how much of the underlying earth has been contaminated , the extent of the clean-up operation is still pure speculation .
" one million cubic meters is more or less what has already spilled out , and another 500,000 could be added to that , " he said .
" that is an immense quantity .
we 're talking about 40 square kilometers of polluted earth . and we do n't know how deep the contamination is yet .
if it 's a meter rather than half a meter , then obviously that means twice as much earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says the clean-up could take years privatization blamed the hungarian government has been careful to lay the blame for the catastrophe squarely with the operators of the aluminum plant , but obermayr criticized the government 's own response .
" the disaster happened last monday , and we published the results of our tests last friday , " he said .
" until then , the government was silent about the extent to which the people living there were in danger .
they did n't say anything about possible water contamination or even what chemicals we 're dealing with .
that really is very negligent . "
obermayr also said that very serious questions needed to be asked of the company .
" a dam does n't just break , " he said .
" either there was too much sludge in the reservoir , or the dam was not properly maintained .
in either case the owners have a very clear responsibility . "
greenpeace has also laid the blame on hungary 's privatization policy .
" the company purchased the plant very cheaply in 1995 , and have made huge profits from this plant since then , " he said .
" apparently either they did n't adhere to the safety regulations , or they over-burdened the dam in order to maximize the profits . "
greenpeace has also raised questions about the contingency plans for such an emergency .
" we know that the company made no such plans , " said obermayr .
" we ca n't prove whether the hungarian authorities have acted negligently or not .
but no-one comes out of this looking good . "

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to improve integration merkel expressed her agreement with seehofer with regard to the process of bringing in skilled labor , saying that " existing potential had to be exhausted first " before allowing the influx of foreign skilled labor .
on the heels of merkel 's meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin , in which she reiterated that negotiations for eu membership for turkey remained " open-ended with no guarantees , " seehofer told focus magazine that some groups of immigrants should be excluded from germany . " it is clear that immigrants from foreign cultural circles , like turkey or arab countries , have a hard time , " he told the weekly news magazine focus .
" that leads me to the conclusion that we do not need any more migrants from other cultural circles , " he said . opposition demands apologies the green party 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , accused seehofer of right-wing populism and immediately demanded an apology , which seehofer refused to concede on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer ruffled more than a few feathers with his remarks the social democrat interior minister of the city-state of berlin , ehrhart koerting , accused seehofer of " stigmatizing " certain immigrants and undermining domestic peace . members of merkel 's ruling coalition , made up of the chancellor 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the free market liberals fdp and seehofer 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , also expressed doubts about the bavarian leader 's comments . " the question is whether horst seehofer wants to prevent additional immigration or get around existing law , " the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach told the daily saarbruecker zeitung .
" if it 's the latter , than i have doubts about its constitutionality . " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the fdp , called for a " rational integration and migration policy - not an intentional simplification and populist debate over an end to migration . ongoing debate since august , a debate has been raging in germany after thilo sarrazin , a prominent central banker , who later resigned , said the country was being made " dumber " by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants and their children . german president christian wulff further fanned the flames on october 3 by saying at celebrations marking 20 years of german reunification that islam had become " a part of germany , " earning him sharp rebukes from conservatives . bildunterschrift : most germans take umbrage at the perceived lack of integration by muslim immigrants the state premier of hesse , volker bouffier , rejected wulff 's assessment saying , " islam did not belong to the foundations of our republic , " and that germany did not need to change , but rather the islamic immigrants . a representative survey carried out by the emnid polling institute last week for focus magazine , prior to erdogan 's visit , revealed that 60 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey . in another poll conducted by emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper during the same period , 59 percent believed the large majority of muslims living in germany were unwilling to accept and respect the german constitution . author : gabriel borrud , gregg benzow -lrb- reuters / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dead fish found in hungary 's danube after toxic spill this toxic spill is a reminder to all who benefit from industry that we must demand clean up which protects the environmental future of our children . - anne , canada it is inconceivable to have allowed such an amount of toxic waste to accumulate -lrb- near human habitation and crucial rivers , no less ! -rrb- .
where was the eu when prevention mattered ?
i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .
the villages downstream must be prepared to move to higher ground .
a rental company of trucks could help move materials and the train system could carry the soil to be burned .
gps should be used to send information to a command center and follow the water movement with google earth . - malcolm , canada if hungary is so concerned over the availability of drinkable water , why has it sold the rights to nestle to take water from the kali basin by the thousands of gallons daily ?
this well is only 25 miles or so from the toxic sludge spill .
i question any country 's carelessness that is so willing to sell precious resources such as drinkable water at this time . - emmie , us there is a way to manage river water flow in a way to help minimize the spread and provide ph neutralization .
but i 'll be needed to be heard at the highest levels .
this is europe 's deepwater horizon , in my view . - vivek , india while the results of investigation of the causes of the catastrophe are not yet known , it seem that the mal zrt. company must bear full responsibility for the disaster .
while it is hard to say if the measures taken by hungarian authorities have been the best possible , i am impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of hungarian catastrophe teams .
it is sad to see , however , that some actors of international media are trying to create panic rather than contribute to objective communication . - borisz , hungary of course enough is not being done to prevent a second spill if there are fears of new toxic spill .
now we can barely hear the strauss 's vals " the blue danube , " next month we will hear from a metal band : “ the toxic danube . ”
an apology for this industry is not enough , it must be closed or at least it has to pay all damages to this village or put it them in condition again . - henry , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
dead fish found in hungary 's danube after toxic spill this toxic spill is a reminder to all who benefit from industry that we must demand clean up which protects the environmental future of our children . - anne , canada it is inconceivable to have allowed such an amount of toxic waste to accumulate -lrb- near human habitation and crucial rivers , no less ! -rrb- .
where was the eu when prevention mattered ?
i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .
the villages downstream must be prepared to move to higher ground .
a rental company of trucks could help move materials and the train system could carry the soil to be burned .
gps should be used to send information to a command center and follow the water movement with google earth . - malcolm , canada if hungary is so concerned over the availability of drinkable water , why has it sold the rights to nestle to take water from the kali basin by the thousands of gallons daily ?
this well is only 25 miles or so from the toxic sludge spill .
i question any country 's carelessness that is so willing to sell precious resources such as drinkable water at this time . - emmie , us there is a way to manage river water flow in a way to help minimize the spread and provide ph neutralization .
but i 'll be needed to be heard at the highest levels .
this is europe 's deepwater horizon , in my view . - vivek , india while the results of investigation of the causes of the catastrophe are not yet known , it seem that the mal zrt. company must bear full responsibility for the disaster .
while it is hard to say if the measures taken by hungarian authorities have been the best possible , i am impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of hungarian catastrophe teams .
it is sad to see , however , that some actors of international media are trying to create panic rather than contribute to objective communication . - borisz , hungary of course enough is not being done to prevent a second spill if there are fears of new toxic spill .
now we can barely hear the strauss 's vals " the blue danube , " next month we will hear from a metal band : “ the toxic danube . ”
an apology for this industry is not enough , it must be closed or at least it has to pay all damages to this village or put it them in condition again . - henry , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de hungary declares state of emergency over toxic spill hungary has declared a state of emergency in three counties over a toxic sludge spill that has killed at least four people and injured more than 100 others .

korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

cities like duesseldorf and cologne , the two leading cities in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , are eager to show investors from india that they are most welcome .
they have promised that indian businessmen never have to wait longer than four weeks to obtain residence and work permits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's cheapest car ' nano ' by tata motors this policy seems to have paid off .
about 100 indian companies are based in germany 's most populous state .
90 percent of these have been acquired in recent years from german owners .
tapan chattopadhyay , the head of the indian business delegation , says that germany with its state-of-the-art technology can help indian companies enormously " in fact a lot of indian companies have invested in germany .
to be precise : tata and other leading industrialists have opted for germany , " he explains . german-indian technology transfer for the last 15 years india 's industry has been contributing 17 percent to the country 's gross domestic product .
in order to increase this share , the country is partnering with key industrial nations around the world . but there is another reason why indian politicians and business leaders are especially attracted to europe 's largest economic power .
apart from the technology transfer germany can help indian companies in upgrading knowledge .
" in india , because a large slice of the population is between 20 to 30 , there is a great scope of upgrading their technological skills , " says tapan chattopadhyay , " it may be in the field of agriculture , it may be in the field of services , in the field of engineering .
and also clean technology , green technology , which india has been striving to adopt . " upgrading skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technology transfer : germany 's former president horst koehler with indian minister of science and technology prithviraj chavan outstanding vocational training is the key to germany 's success in today 's globalized economy , the indian entrepreneurs and decision-makers visiting germany kept repeating .
according to indian government figures , only 25 percent of the indian workforce is trained . dirk matter , duesseldorf representative of the indo-german chamber of commerce , thinks both countries will benefit when they ramp up their trade relations .
for example , when india 's famous low-cost car , the tata nano , was developed , 35 german suppliers and technology partners were involved .
and they make money on each unit sold . india emerging economic world power according to matter , people in germany should take india seriously as an emerging economic world power .
but he adds that they should not panic when indian companies take over german firms . " due to the global financial crisis , many german companies were undervalued in 2009 .
and indian businessmen were clever enough to take the opportunity and buy into the german industrial sector .
not to outsource and off-shore production , nor to cut back on jobs .
but to get access to german technology , to understand our marketing strategies . " excluding oil imports from arab countries , germany already ranks third behind china and the us amongst india ’ s most important suppliers .
but the fact that india is only number 26 among germany ’ s trade partners has to be changed . author : thomas kohlmann editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 11.10.2010 germany launches 2.0 fight against nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extremists are becoming increasingly savvy on social networks social network platforms in germany have launched a week-long campaign to battle right-wing extremism on the internet .
facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .
big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .
" but at the moment , our company in germany is still in its set-up-period . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

dw-world.de social factors , not political ideology , lead to extremism extremists of all political persuasions - from the molotov cocktail-throwing anarchist to the neo-nazi skinhead - have a lot in common according to a new study by germany 's criminal police agency .

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cities like duesseldorf and cologne , the two leading cities in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , are eager to show investors from india that they are most welcome .
they have promised that indian businessmen never have to wait longer than four weeks to obtain residence and work permits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's cheapest car ' nano ' by tata motors this policy seems to have paid off .
about 100 indian companies are based in germany 's most populous state .
90 percent of these have been acquired in recent years from german owners .
tapan chattopadhyay , the head of the indian business delegation , says that germany with its state-of-the-art technology can help indian companies enormously " in fact a lot of indian companies have invested in germany .
to be precise : tata and other leading industrialists have opted for germany , " he explains . german-indian technology transfer for the last 15 years india 's industry has been contributing 17 percent to the country 's gross domestic product .
in order to increase this share , the country is partnering with key industrial nations around the world . but there is another reason why indian politicians and business leaders are especially attracted to europe 's largest economic power .
apart from the technology transfer germany can help indian companies in upgrading knowledge .
" in india , because a large slice of the population is between 20 to 30 , there is a great scope of upgrading their technological skills , " says tapan chattopadhyay , " it may be in the field of agriculture , it may be in the field of services , in the field of engineering .
and also clean technology , green technology , which india has been striving to adopt . " upgrading skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technology transfer : germany 's former president horst koehler with indian minister of science and technology prithviraj chavan outstanding vocational training is the key to germany 's success in today 's globalized economy , the indian entrepreneurs and decision-makers visiting germany kept repeating .
according to indian government figures , only 25 percent of the indian workforce is trained . dirk matter , duesseldorf representative of the indo-german chamber of commerce , thinks both countries will benefit when they ramp up their trade relations .
for example , when india 's famous low-cost car , the tata nano , was developed , 35 german suppliers and technology partners were involved .
and they make money on each unit sold . india emerging economic world power according to matter , people in germany should take india seriously as an emerging economic world power .
but he adds that they should not panic when indian companies take over german firms . " due to the global financial crisis , many german companies were undervalued in 2009 .
and indian businessmen were clever enough to take the opportunity and buy into the german industrial sector .
not to outsource and off-shore production , nor to cut back on jobs .
but to get access to german technology , to understand our marketing strategies . " excluding oil imports from arab countries , germany already ranks third behind china and the us amongst india ’ s most important suppliers .
but the fact that india is only number 26 among germany ’ s trade partners has to be changed . author : thomas kohlmann editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dead fish found in hungary 's danube after toxic spill this toxic spill is a reminder to all who benefit from industry that we must demand clean up which protects the environmental future of our children . - anne , canada it is inconceivable to have allowed such an amount of toxic waste to accumulate -lrb- near human habitation and crucial rivers , no less ! -rrb- .
where was the eu when prevention mattered ?
i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .
the villages downstream must be prepared to move to higher ground .
a rental company of trucks could help move materials and the train system could carry the soil to be burned .
gps should be used to send information to a command center and follow the water movement with google earth . - malcolm , canada if hungary is so concerned over the availability of drinkable water , why has it sold the rights to nestle to take water from the kali basin by the thousands of gallons daily ?
this well is only 25 miles or so from the toxic sludge spill .
i question any country 's carelessness that is so willing to sell precious resources such as drinkable water at this time . - emmie , us there is a way to manage river water flow in a way to help minimize the spread and provide ph neutralization .
but i 'll be needed to be heard at the highest levels .
this is europe 's deepwater horizon , in my view . - vivek , india while the results of investigation of the causes of the catastrophe are not yet known , it seem that the mal zrt. company must bear full responsibility for the disaster .
while it is hard to say if the measures taken by hungarian authorities have been the best possible , i am impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of hungarian catastrophe teams .
it is sad to see , however , that some actors of international media are trying to create panic rather than contribute to objective communication . - borisz , hungary of course enough is not being done to prevent a second spill if there are fears of new toxic spill .
now we can barely hear the strauss 's vals " the blue danube , " next month we will hear from a metal band : “ the toxic danube . ”
an apology for this industry is not enough , it must be closed or at least it has to pay all damages to this village or put it them in condition again . - henry , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .
the panel of three judges handed down a sentence of life in prison for the 38-year-old officer .
korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .
big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .
" but at the moment , our company in germany is still in its set-up-period . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 11.10.2010 ceo arrested over hungarian toxic sludge crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spillage was described as hungary 's worst ever environmental disaster police have detained the director of the company that owns the reservoir which flooded several towns with toxic red sludge last monday .
but greenpeace has condemned the government 's own handling of the crisis . hungarian police have arrested zoltan bakonyi , ceo of mal rt. , the hungarian aluminum company that owned that plant , and prime minister viktor orban told parliament in budapest that the government must now take over the company and freeze its assets .
the development comes as hundreds of volunteers , disaster-relief teams and engineers race against time to erect a new dam around a reservoir of chemical residue , which authorities fear could crumble if rain arrives as forecast later this week .
the new dam is expected to be completed on monday evening .
up to a million cubic metres of caustic red sludge poured from the waste reservoir of an alumina plant in western hungary a week ago , leaving seven dead and a large area of countryside covered in red sludge .
a five-member eu civil protection team comprising french , belgian , swedish , austrian and german experts has been dispatched to help limit the damage , the european commission said in a statement .
eu chief jose manuel barroso will also visit hungary on tuesday .
barroso is not expected to visit the site of the ecological disaster , but his previously-arranged talks with orban are " timely , " said european commission spokesman olivier bailly .
where to put the mud ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian government faces scrutiny over its handling of the mess the environmental group greenpeace , which measured the chemical content of the mud , said that the desperate efforts to contain the damage and prevent further spillage will be dwarfed by the massive clean-up operation that is yet to begin .
" they ca n't even think about cleaning up at the moment , " bernhard obermayr , greenpeace campaign director for eastern europe , told deutsche welle .
" that will be the big challenge in the next weeks , months , years . "
obermayr expects the operation to take a long time .
" they will have to remove this unbelievable quantity of poisonous mud , as well as contaminated earth , and deposit it somewhere safely , " he said .
" hungary does n't even have the deposit capacity for this quantity of toxic waste . "
since it is still unclear how much of the underlying earth has been contaminated , the extent of the clean-up operation is still pure speculation .
" one million cubic meters is more or less what has already spilled out , and another 500,000 could be added to that , " he said .
" that is an immense quantity .
we 're talking about 40 square kilometers of polluted earth . and we do n't know how deep the contamination is yet .
if it 's a meter rather than half a meter , then obviously that means twice as much earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace says the clean-up could take years privatization blamed the hungarian government has been careful to lay the blame for the catastrophe squarely with the operators of the aluminum plant , but obermayr criticized the government 's own response .
" the disaster happened last monday , and we published the results of our tests last friday , " he said .
" until then , the government was silent about the extent to which the people living there were in danger .
they did n't say anything about possible water contamination or even what chemicals we 're dealing with .
that really is very negligent . "
obermayr also said that very serious questions needed to be asked of the company .
" a dam does n't just break , " he said .
" either there was too much sludge in the reservoir , or the dam was not properly maintained .
in either case the owners have a very clear responsibility . "
greenpeace has also laid the blame on hungary 's privatization policy .
" the company purchased the plant very cheaply in 1995 , and have made huge profits from this plant since then , " he said .
" apparently either they did n't adhere to the safety regulations , or they over-burdened the dam in order to maximize the profits . "
greenpeace has also raised questions about the contingency plans for such an emergency .
" we know that the company made no such plans , " said obermayr .
" we ca n't prove whether the hungarian authorities have acted negligently or not .
but no-one comes out of this looking good . "

do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 11.10.2010 csu to vote on gender quota for women in leadership roles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebler said the 40-percent quota is only a first step the christian social union of bavaria is one of germany 's most old-school conservative political parties - and it has the lowest rate of female membership .
but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .
the panel of three judges handed down a sentence of life in prison for the 38-year-old officer .
korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

merkel said he was misconstrued . german chancellor angela merkel has defended the state premier of bavaria 's controversial call for restrictions to immigration . deputy government spokesperson sabine heimbach said merkel spoke with horst seehofer earlier on monday and that he had explained that his position had been " misrepresented . " he said his call for restrictions on immigrants from turkey or arab countries was directed " merely at skilled laborers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to improve integration merkel expressed her agreement with seehofer with regard to the process of bringing in skilled labor , saying that " existing potential had to be exhausted first " before allowing the influx of foreign skilled labor .
on the heels of merkel 's meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin , in which she reiterated that negotiations for eu membership for turkey remained " open-ended with no guarantees , " seehofer told focus magazine that some groups of immigrants should be excluded from germany . " it is clear that immigrants from foreign cultural circles , like turkey or arab countries , have a hard time , " he told the weekly news magazine focus .
" that leads me to the conclusion that we do not need any more migrants from other cultural circles , " he said . opposition demands apologies the green party 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , accused seehofer of right-wing populism and immediately demanded an apology , which seehofer refused to concede on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer ruffled more than a few feathers with his remarks the social democrat interior minister of the city-state of berlin , ehrhart koerting , accused seehofer of " stigmatizing " certain immigrants and undermining domestic peace . members of merkel 's ruling coalition , made up of the chancellor 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the free market liberals fdp and seehofer 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , also expressed doubts about the bavarian leader 's comments . " the question is whether horst seehofer wants to prevent additional immigration or get around existing law , " the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach told the daily saarbruecker zeitung .
" if it 's the latter , than i have doubts about its constitutionality . " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the fdp , called for a " rational integration and migration policy - not an intentional simplification and populist debate over an end to migration . ongoing debate since august , a debate has been raging in germany after thilo sarrazin , a prominent central banker , who later resigned , said the country was being made " dumber " by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants and their children . german president christian wulff further fanned the flames on october 3 by saying at celebrations marking 20 years of german reunification that islam had become " a part of germany , " earning him sharp rebukes from conservatives . bildunterschrift : most germans take umbrage at the perceived lack of integration by muslim immigrants the state premier of hesse , volker bouffier , rejected wulff 's assessment saying , " islam did not belong to the foundations of our republic , " and that germany did not need to change , but rather the islamic immigrants . a representative survey carried out by the emnid polling institute last week for focus magazine , prior to erdogan 's visit , revealed that 60 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey . in another poll conducted by emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper during the same period , 59 percent believed the large majority of muslims living in germany were unwilling to accept and respect the german constitution . author : gabriel borrud , gregg benzow -lrb- reuters / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 11.10.2010 urban artists bring street vibe indoors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spray paint evokes mixed reactions among the general public once clandestine and illegal , street art has gone mainstream in recent years , even making its way into galleries and art fairs .
berlin is particularly fertile ground , say the artists . for decades , urban art forms involving spray cans , stencils and paste-ups have been executed under the cover of darkness .
often merging social commentary with urban beautification , artists needed to work quickly - and stay one step ahead of police and security guards . now , street art is wandering from the alley to the art gallery - thanks to star underground artists like britain 's banksy , who auctioned a piece for 288,000 pounds -lrb- around $ 460,000 -rrb- in 2007 and raised the eyebrows of gallerists the world over . recently in berlin , galleries representing street artists have popped up across the city .
with the significant leap from outdoors to indoors already accomplished , street art fairs were bound to follow - even though these have traditionally been the domain of mainstream art forms .
street art 's answer to basel and venice is stroke.03 , held in berlin this past week . " most of the -lsb- street -rsb- artists represented here ca n't do illegal work , or they do n't want to do illegal work anymore because they can not finish a piece in five minutes without having any lights , " marco schwalbe , a co-founder of stroke.03 , told deutsche welle .
he added that moving into galleries was simply a practical step for many street artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british artist banksy has been instrumental in " legitimizing " street art schwalbe also runs the intoxicated demons urban art gallery in berlin 's alternative kreuzberg district .
as a gallerist , he saw the need for an art fair dedicated to the worldwide phenomenon of urban art and also affordable for smaller up-and-coming galleries . gaining legitimacy indoors and out danish street artist morten andersen , whose work is represented at stroke.03 , learned the art of graffiti as a hip hop-obsessed teenager in the late 1980s .
after spraying illegally for 10 years , he now only works at locations where he has permission , but has also moved indoors to work on canvas . " what i like about painting inside is you can take the raw vibe that you have from the street and put this on a canvas , " he said .
" and you can take this canvas a lot of places .
you can take it to la for a show .
you can take it to berlin for a show .
this you ca n't do with a wall . " while his lines , forms and colors clearly reference his graffiti background , the works themselves are an abstract form of urban expression . emess , a berlin-based stencil artist , appreciates the dialogue that occurs when artists paint in public spaces , rather than on canvases in isolated studios . " something i love about the street is when you put something out there and it 's trashed the next day you know it was n't worth it , " he said , " but if people paint around it , like even house owners painting the facade around your piece - that 's cool . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stencil art - like this work by snik & finbarr - is an alternative to the old-school spray can emess was inspired when he saw figurative works that communicated a message by well-known street artists like banksy and new york-based swoon . " when i saw the first banksy show , i started cutting stencils the next day , " said emess . street art is for everyone compared to many more conservative cities , the street art scene in berlin is more tolerated by both the authorities and the residents , said artist morten andersen . " there 's always been this thing with spray cans .
you know when people see it they feel like , ' shall we call the cops or clap our hands ? " ' said andersen , who added that the hype around artists like banksy has helped legitimize urban art among the general public . but with this sudden hype have come collectors and others wanting to cash in by cutting works by well-known street artists out of fences , gates and sides of buildings in order to sell them for inflated prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroke.03 attracted street artists from around the world , like american chor boogie according to stroke.03 co-founder schwalbe , " if you put something on public property , then somebody might take it .
i think that 's part of the process and i would never sue anybody who 's doing that . " but berlin-based artist emess disagreed .
" it ’ s a little bit like a lawn full of flowers .
if everybody collects one flower , in the end it 's empty , " he explained .
that 's one of the main reasons emess also sells his work in a gallery . " if you really like it , then pay the artist and the gallerist and buy something in a gallery and then you have it , " he said .
" and then you 're supporting the art form and the artist . " author : cinnamon nippard editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute in oslo , spoke to deutsche welle about the decision and the reaction . this year 's nobel peace prize has been awarded to detained chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
deutsche welle spoke to geir lundestad about the reactions of the chinese leadership .
deutsche welle : some argue that it is not fair to use the nobel peace prize for political reasons .
but isn ’ t peace itself a political term ?
geir lundestad : peace has certainly something to do with politics .
it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .

merkel said he was misconstrued . german chancellor angela merkel has defended the state premier of bavaria 's controversial call for restrictions to immigration . deputy government spokesperson sabine heimbach said merkel spoke with horst seehofer earlier on monday and that he had explained that his position had been " misrepresented . " he said his call for restrictions on immigrants from turkey or arab countries was directed " merely at skilled laborers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to improve integration merkel expressed her agreement with seehofer with regard to the process of bringing in skilled labor , saying that " existing potential had to be exhausted first " before allowing the influx of foreign skilled labor .
on the heels of merkel 's meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin , in which she reiterated that negotiations for eu membership for turkey remained " open-ended with no guarantees , " seehofer told focus magazine that some groups of immigrants should be excluded from germany . " it is clear that immigrants from foreign cultural circles , like turkey or arab countries , have a hard time , " he told the weekly news magazine focus .
" that leads me to the conclusion that we do not need any more migrants from other cultural circles , " he said . opposition demands apologies the green party 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , accused seehofer of right-wing populism and immediately demanded an apology , which seehofer refused to concede on monday .

" the question is whether horst seehofer wants to prevent additional immigration or get around existing law , " the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach told the daily saarbruecker zeitung .
" if it 's the latter , than i have doubts about its constitutionality . " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the fdp , called for a " rational integration and migration policy - not an intentional simplification and populist debate over an end to migration . ongoing debate since august , a debate has been raging in germany after thilo sarrazin , a prominent central banker , who later resigned , said the country was being made " dumber " by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants and their children . german president christian wulff further fanned the flames on october 3 by saying at celebrations marking 20 years of german reunification that islam had become " a part of germany , " earning him sharp rebukes from conservatives . bildunterschrift : most germans take umbrage at the perceived lack of integration by muslim immigrants the state premier of hesse , volker bouffier , rejected wulff 's assessment saying , " islam did not belong to the foundations of our republic , " and that germany did not need to change , but rather the islamic immigrants . a representative survey carried out by the emnid polling institute last week for focus magazine , prior to erdogan 's visit , revealed that 60 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey . in another poll conducted by emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper during the same period , 59 percent believed the large majority of muslims living in germany were unwilling to accept and respect the german constitution . author : gabriel borrud , gregg benzow -lrb- reuters / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

facebook has been criticized for not taking part . the initiative " social networks against nazis " was launched on monday in berlin by 20 social networks such as myspace , youtube and studivz .
the aim is to mobilize users of social networks to join the battle against neo-nazi ideas on the web by reporting extremist content .
" right-wing extremists are part of all social networks in germany and they are trying to place their hateful , racist and inhuman statements , " a spokesperson for the initiative told reporters .
" nazis try to recruit online , and they have been more subtle than they used to be , which makes it harder to identify them right away . "
german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner launched the campaign together with the organizers the online portal " netz-gegen-nazis " , -lrb- " net against nazis " -rrb- , the amadeu-antonio foundation and the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
aigner said that " enemies of the constitution - right-wing extremists as well as left-wing extremists - should not find a place on these platforms . " she also encouraged the social networks to make use of their " domestic authority " and use it as a way to get rid of nazis .
big player facebook not on board since a broad range of social networks are taking part in the week-long campaign , critics have mentioned the fact that the big player in the social networking world - facebook - is not among them .
" we appreciate the initiative " netz-gegen-nazis " and we are looking forward to a cooperation in the future , " a spokesperson for facebook told deutsche welle .
" but at the moment , our company in germany is still in its set-up-period . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast amount of data makes a screening beforehand impossible huge amount of data causes problems one big problem for social networks is the amount of data uploaded to their sites .
according to youtube , 24 hours of video material gets uploaded every minute which makes a pre-screening of all material impossible .
but once a video was recognized as containing nazi content and was taken down , the user can not upload it again even if he renames it , said youtube - thanks to a special video recognition software .
simone rafael from " netz-gegen-nazis " said right-wing extremists had become cleverer and refrain from posting obvious notes .
instead , they raise a controversial issue such as " death penalty for child abusers " in order to gather people in a group and bring them closer to their ideas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 11.10.2010 csu to vote on gender quota for women in leadership roles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebler said the 40-percent quota is only a first step the christian social union of bavaria is one of germany 's most old-school conservative political parties - and it has the lowest rate of female membership .
but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

they cover less than 0.2 percent of the ocean floor but harbor almost a quarter of all marine species .
they 're also a key source of food , income and coastal protection for around 500 million people worldwide .
but the reefs are increasingly at risk .
a 2008 study by the global coral reef monitoring network said that a fifth of the world 's coral reefs have died or been destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coral reefs off papua new guinea are still largely intact however the situation is n't without hope .
in papua new guinea , home to 76 percent of the world 's coral species and 600 types of fish , most reefs are still considered intact and functional .
widely considered a global epicenter of marine biodiversity , the country is part of the so-called coral triangle - an area that includes the tropical marine waters of indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , timor leste and the solomon islands .
" coral reef systems in papua new guinea are still in their pristine condition , therefore it is not too late to save and protect them , " local marine biologist noel wangunu said .
" it is now important that coral reefs are given some protection so that they build up their resilience to withstand impacts . "
extreme heat bleaches coral the biggest risk comes from rising temperatures , with potentially significant impacts on food security and livelihoods in vulnerable coastal communities .
coral reefs are the foundation not only of important fishing industries but also of tourist economies . the effects of climate change are felt more directly in the oceans than on land , even if these impacts are less visible . this year 's extreme heat is putting the world 's coral reefs under severe stress .
" -lrb- global warming -rrb- impacts on coral reefs through ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperatures , driving massive coral bleaching effects , " wangunu said .
but the more immediate causes of coral reef degradation are brought about by local economies and human-driven activities including coastal development , deforestation and unrestricted tourism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human-driven activities are largely to blame for the loss of corals " overfishing is a significant threat to reef systems in the pacific , " nicola barnard , acting director of the international coral reef action network , said .
" watershed pollution also affects the region , largely as a result of forest clearance , erosion and inland mining , which is a source of sediments and pollution into reef systems which can smother corals in the near shore .
moreover , urbanization has led to direct clearance of mangroves and has had indirect impacts from solid waste and sewage dumping . " raising awareness experts agree that raising community awareness is the key to conserving corals . " the majority of papua new guineans are yet to fully understand the threats facing the oceans and its consequences on biological diversity , " wanganu said .
" many coastal societies use the sea as a ' supermarket ' to support their daily livelihood .
there is general understanding of the shortage of commercially viable species and the declining biodiversity , but they lack the ability to piece together all these changes and develop management strategies to address these . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coastal communities use the sea as a " supermarket " the survival of the coral reefs depends on the local population learning how to balance its economic needs while respecting the environment .
experts say that conservation concepts need to be better explained to local communities in terms of how they will benefit from their resources .
and involving local communities in any effort to conserve the marine ecosystems is just as important .
“ there is very little in the way of a traditional conservation ethic anywhere in melanesia -lrb- a group of islands in the pacific ocean -rrb- , " simon foale from the australian research council center of excellence for coral reef studies said .
" in the modern context of rapidly burgeoning populations and markets , there is a need for good science communication about the impacts of heavy fishing on population dynamics of reef fisheries which , together with the very rich local knowledge that is present in many communities , can help people come up with their own management solutions . "
global solution needed while coral-rich countries such as papua new guinea explore local solutions to preserve its natural wealth , experts point out that a global approach is the only way to ultimately win the fight to save corals .
the protection of coral reefs and the biodiversity they harbor are now part of international negotiations on curbing climate change .
last year at a meeting in denmark organized by the global legislators organisation for a balanced environment -lrb- globe -rrb- , researchers said that most coral reefs may not survive even if tough regulations on greenhouse gases are put in place .
some experts point out that human behavior too needs to change if the vulnerable ecosystems are to be saved .
" the most important thing we can do for coral reefs is reduce our co2 emissions , ” stephanie wear , director of coral reef conservation at the nature conservancy , an ngo supporting the papua new guinea government 's effort to conserve biodiversity , said .
“ the global community takes its toll .
for example : the choices we make in seafood impact coral reefs .
avoiding coral reef fish on the menu is something that any person can do no matter where they are in the world . "

geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute in oslo , spoke to deutsche welle about the decision and the reaction . this year 's nobel peace prize has been awarded to detained chinese dissident liu xiaobo .
deutsche welle spoke to geir lundestad about the reactions of the chinese leadership .
deutsche welle : some argue that it is not fair to use the nobel peace prize for political reasons .
but isn ’ t peace itself a political term ?
geir lundestad : peace has certainly something to do with politics .
it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .
and at a time when china has become so important in international affairs , i think these chinese leaders should expect to be held accountable to the treaties they have signed or ratified and to the relevant clauses in their own constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 11.10.2010 urban artists bring street vibe indoors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spray paint evokes mixed reactions among the general public once clandestine and illegal , street art has gone mainstream in recent years , even making its way into galleries and art fairs .
berlin is particularly fertile ground , say the artists . for decades , urban art forms involving spray cans , stencils and paste-ups have been executed under the cover of darkness .
often merging social commentary with urban beautification , artists needed to work quickly - and stay one step ahead of police and security guards . now , street art is wandering from the alley to the art gallery - thanks to star underground artists like britain 's banksy , who auctioned a piece for 288,000 pounds -lrb- around $ 460,000 -rrb- in 2007 and raised the eyebrows of gallerists the world over . recently in berlin , galleries representing street artists have popped up across the city .
with the significant leap from outdoors to indoors already accomplished , street art fairs were bound to follow - even though these have traditionally been the domain of mainstream art forms .
street art 's answer to basel and venice is stroke.03 , held in berlin this past week . " most of the -lsb- street -rsb- artists represented here ca n't do illegal work , or they do n't want to do illegal work anymore because they can not finish a piece in five minutes without having any lights , " marco schwalbe , a co-founder of stroke.03 , told deutsche welle .
he added that moving into galleries was simply a practical step for many street artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british artist banksy has been instrumental in " legitimizing " street art schwalbe also runs the intoxicated demons urban art gallery in berlin 's alternative kreuzberg district .
as a gallerist , he saw the need for an art fair dedicated to the worldwide phenomenon of urban art and also affordable for smaller up-and-coming galleries . gaining legitimacy indoors and out danish street artist morten andersen , whose work is represented at stroke.03 , learned the art of graffiti as a hip hop-obsessed teenager in the late 1980s .
after spraying illegally for 10 years , he now only works at locations where he has permission , but has also moved indoors to work on canvas . " what i like about painting inside is you can take the raw vibe that you have from the street and put this on a canvas , " he said .
" and you can take this canvas a lot of places .
you can take it to la for a show .
you can take it to berlin for a show .
this you ca n't do with a wall . " while his lines , forms and colors clearly reference his graffiti background , the works themselves are an abstract form of urban expression . emess , a berlin-based stencil artist , appreciates the dialogue that occurs when artists paint in public spaces , rather than on canvases in isolated studios . " something i love about the street is when you put something out there and it 's trashed the next day you know it was n't worth it , " he said , " but if people paint around it , like even house owners painting the facade around your piece - that 's cool . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stencil art - like this work by snik & finbarr - is an alternative to the old-school spray can emess was inspired when he saw figurative works that communicated a message by well-known street artists like banksy and new york-based swoon . " when i saw the first banksy show , i started cutting stencils the next day , " said emess . street art is for everyone compared to many more conservative cities , the street art scene in berlin is more tolerated by both the authorities and the residents , said artist morten andersen . " there 's always been this thing with spray cans .
you know when people see it they feel like , ' shall we call the cops or clap our hands ? " ' said andersen , who added that the hype around artists like banksy has helped legitimize urban art among the general public . but with this sudden hype have come collectors and others wanting to cash in by cutting works by well-known street artists out of fences , gates and sides of buildings in order to sell them for inflated prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroke.03 attracted street artists from around the world , like american chor boogie according to stroke.03 co-founder schwalbe , " if you put something on public property , then somebody might take it .
i think that 's part of the process and i would never sue anybody who 's doing that . " but berlin-based artist emess disagreed .
" it ’ s a little bit like a lawn full of flowers .
if everybody collects one flower , in the end it 's empty , " he explained .
that 's one of the main reasons emess also sells his work in a gallery . " if you really like it , then pay the artist and the gallerist and buy something in a gallery and then you have it , " he said .
" and then you 're supporting the art form and the artist . " author : cinnamon nippard editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said he was misconstrued . german chancellor angela merkel has defended the state premier of bavaria 's controversial call for restrictions to immigration . deputy government spokesperson sabine heimbach said merkel spoke with horst seehofer earlier on monday and that he had explained that his position had been " misrepresented . " he said his call for restrictions on immigrants from turkey or arab countries was directed " merely at skilled laborers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to improve integration merkel expressed her agreement with seehofer with regard to the process of bringing in skilled labor , saying that " existing potential had to be exhausted first " before allowing the influx of foreign skilled labor .
on the heels of merkel 's meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin , in which she reiterated that negotiations for eu membership for turkey remained " open-ended with no guarantees , " seehofer told focus magazine that some groups of immigrants should be excluded from germany . " it is clear that immigrants from foreign cultural circles , like turkey or arab countries , have a hard time , " he told the weekly news magazine focus .
" that leads me to the conclusion that we do not need any more migrants from other cultural circles , " he said . opposition demands apologies the green party 's parliamentary leader , renate kuenast , accused seehofer of right-wing populism and immediately demanded an apology , which seehofer refused to concede on monday .

" the question is whether horst seehofer wants to prevent additional immigration or get around existing law , " the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach told the daily saarbruecker zeitung .
" if it 's the latter , than i have doubts about its constitutionality . " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the fdp , called for a " rational integration and migration policy - not an intentional simplification and populist debate over an end to migration . ongoing debate since august , a debate has been raging in germany after thilo sarrazin , a prominent central banker , who later resigned , said the country was being made " dumber " by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants and their children . german president christian wulff further fanned the flames on october 3 by saying at celebrations marking 20 years of german reunification that islam had become " a part of germany , " earning him sharp rebukes from conservatives . bildunterschrift : most germans take umbrage at the perceived lack of integration by muslim immigrants the state premier of hesse , volker bouffier , rejected wulff 's assessment saying , " islam did not belong to the foundations of our republic , " and that germany did not need to change , but rather the islamic immigrants . a representative survey carried out by the emnid polling institute last week for focus magazine , prior to erdogan 's visit , revealed that 60 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey . in another poll conducted by emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper during the same period , 59 percent believed the large majority of muslims living in germany were unwilling to accept and respect the german constitution . author : gabriel borrud , gregg benzow -lrb- reuters / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one can not look excessively at bilateral exchange rates , " mersch said in an interview with the business newspaper financial times deutschland .
" what is decisive is the effective exchange rate and there in the third quarter we were not above the second quarter . " optimistic about growth mersch also warned about reading too much into the combination of the euro 's rise and rising interbank rates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 11.10.2010 csu to vote on gender quota for women in leadership roles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebler said the 40-percent quota is only a first step the christian social union of bavaria is one of germany 's most old-school conservative political parties - and it has the lowest rate of female membership .
but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

they cover less than 0.2 percent of the ocean floor but harbor almost a quarter of all marine species .
they 're also a key source of food , income and coastal protection for around 500 million people worldwide .
but the reefs are increasingly at risk .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coral reefs off papua new guinea are still largely intact however the situation is n't without hope .
in papua new guinea , home to 76 percent of the world 's coral species and 600 types of fish , most reefs are still considered intact and functional .
widely considered a global epicenter of marine biodiversity , the country is part of the so-called coral triangle - an area that includes the tropical marine waters of indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , timor leste and the solomon islands .
" coral reef systems in papua new guinea are still in their pristine condition , therefore it is not too late to save and protect them , " local marine biologist noel wangunu said .

he was given a life sentence . the policeman , epaminondas korkoneas , was found guilty by the court in amfissa , greece , over the fatal shooting of a teenage schoolboy , alexis grigoropoulos , while on night patrol in december 2008 .
the panel of three judges handed down a sentence of life in prison for the 38-year-old officer .
korkoneas 's patrol partner , vassilios saraliotis was found guilty of complicity in the crime , given a 10-year jail term .
the defense pledged to appeal the sentences .
the defense argued that the incident had been a tragic accident which arose as the police fired warning shots to disperse youngsters hurling objects at them .
the boy 's autopsy report even indicated that he had been hit by a bullet that ricocheted on to him , but lawyers for his family presented witness testimony claiming the policeman had taken aim and fired .
the teenager 's death sparked major riots in athens and other greek cities , which lasted for two weeks and caused extensive damage to government buildings , private businesses and automobiles .
a far-left extremist group threatened to kill korkoneas , prompting authorities to relocate the trial from athens to amfissa , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 11.10.2010 csu to vote on gender quota for women in leadership roles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebler said the 40-percent quota is only a first step the christian social union of bavaria is one of germany 's most old-school conservative political parties - and it has the lowest rate of female membership .
but party leaders are hoping to change that . a poll released by focus magazine on sunday found that 72 of germans support quotas for women in businesses and 69 percent support quotas in politics .
the results may be important news for the christian social union party in bavaria , which will vote at its party conference in munich on oct .
29 and 30 on whether to introduce a 40 percent quota for women in county- and state-level leadership positions .
state premier horst seehofer has supported the quota and said he is confident he can get a large majority to vote in favor of the quota .
the csu is the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer believes the proposal will pass with a large majority the quota would not apply to local-level positions , where seehofer said a 40-percent quota would be unfeasible .
but the csu 's women 's committee chairwoman angelika niebler said the proposal was only a first step .
" you have to start somewhere , " she said .
" what matters for me is that we as a party are moving forward , we 're bringing more women into leadership roles .
and everything that 's being discussed right now is headed in the right direction . "
other methods fail the csu has the lowest female membership of all political parties in the german parliament .
nineteen percent of members are women , and only 10 percent of leadership roles filled by women .
the greens were the first party in germany to introduce a gender quota , setting a non-binding goal of filling 50 percent of leadership roles with women in 1979 and making it official policy in 1986 .
the social democrats followed suit two years later with a 40-percent quota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has had a 40-percent quota since 1988 the ideas were pioneering at the time , but many young women in the csu now see gender quotas as outdated .
the csu 's youth organization has denounced the proposal as " discriminatory " and " undemocratic , " calling for a women 's mentoring program and a media campaign as alternative solutions .
but dr. isabelle kuerschner , a women 's specialist at the csu-affiliated hanns-seidel foundation , said those methods have been tested - and failed .
" the only effective measure that has been tested and really brought more women into parties is the gender quota , " she told deutsche welle .
" you need some kind of pressure .
so the quota is the pressure parties need to really get more women into leadership positions . "
younger women opposed the csu is not entirely without women in high-level positions .
barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .
but both women support the gender quota as a way of ensuring that future generations of women are included in politics .
bildunterschrift : stamm is one of the few women in the csu who has risen to a high leadership position " i used to be strictly against gender quotas , " stamm told public broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk .
" but unfortunately we have n't caught up yet ... and now i think we as a party have to go in the direction that is necessary . "
the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .
the party needs them to present a fresh face and attract more voters .
but these positions do n't have very much power .
and many of the young women in the csu have not been around long enough to experience real discrimination .
" they have the feeling , ' i can get whatever i want , i can achieve whatever i want to , i just have to work hard and i will be rewarded , " ' she said .
" but that 's not the case , and it takes some time to find that out . "

her writing draws heavily on this experience . last week , writer melinda nadj abonji became the first non-german to win the german book prize .
born in 1968 in vojvodina , a serbian province with a hungarian minority , she moved to switzerland in 1974 .
nadj abonji 's winning novel " falcons without falconers " addresses emigration and longing for home . deutsche welle spoke with nadj abonji at the frankfurt book fair .
click on the audio link below to listen to the author read from " falcons without falconers . " deutsche welle : melinda nadj abonji , you 've won the german book prize for your novel " falcons without falconers . "
do you consider yourself a german writer ? melinda nadj abonji : i am a german writer because i write in german .
i am happy that the germans have given me the prize because i do not live here and because it is the first time someone with a funny name from switzerland with a small swiss publisher has won the german prize for literature ! you write in german , but your first language is hungarian and in " falcons without falconers , " your characters are constantly struggling to find their place within the new language they have chosen to adopt . everything goes through language .
i was without a voice for almost a year , because when i came to switzerland i was living with a swiss family and this family could not speak hungarian .
i was completely lonely .
it was a terrible time for me . i think this is a very important experience for me because i was always aware that you have to fight for language , that language is never certain .
you have to find out what language is , what words mean .
if you make mistakes , then people do n't understand you .
for me , this is a very difficult but also a very basic experience . it 's also taught me that language is something you can play with - in the book this is very important - that language is a field of experience . when your book begins , switzerland and yugoslavia do not seem so very far away .
then war breaks out , and the two worlds become severed from one another .
is this what it felt like living in switzerland during the yugoslavian wars of the 1990s ? yes , this is the reality .
you could not reach certain parts , it was extremely difficult to go to serbia and people were really isolated .
and a lot of things were spread through the media , that the serbians are the cruelest people in the world , etc . we had a lot of experts in switzerland who said “ the war is like this ” and “ the war is like that . ”
they were so convinced they knew everything about this war and this was extremely irritating for me because i felt i did not know anything , and yet it was a really dramatic time for me and my family because we could not reach our family , we did not know about them because we could not reach them , we could not phone .
you had no contact by telephone , no internet , nothing .
if you wrote a letter you did not know if it had reached your family or not .
it was a terrible time . at the time i felt i could not write about it .
later , i thought , this is a very big topic , it 's a very intimate and terrible thing and i want to go through it again , but in another way .
i felt the need to write . despite the traumatic events it deals with , “ falconers without falconers ” is a very warm book , full of love and affection for its characters .
the figure of the grandmother seems to have been drawn with particular warmth .
can you tell us a bit more about her ? the book is homage to my grandmother .
it 's homage to my grandmother , to my grandfather and to another grandmother , both of whom i did not get to know .
i think this is one of the wonderful things about writing , because you can get near to a figure or a person who you would like to know but you did not get the chance because the brutality of the world did not make it possible . interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a very political question .
how do you achieve peace ?
what we have focused on this year is the connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
and the nobel committee has argued for many years that there is such a connection .
we have been very encouraged to see that peace researchers and political scientists have very much have come to the same conclusion .
you can obtain peace through many different ways , for instance through a stable state .
now the chinese government argues that if someone disturbs the stable state , you can not maintain a peaceful society ...
this is what many governments say - that the nobel committee is disturbing peace .
this is what hitler said when we gave the prize to carl von ossietzky .
this is what the kremlin said when we gave the peace prize to andrei sakharov and lech walesa .
this is what they said in south africa , in burma and this is what they say in iran .
they all say that this is disturbing the peace .
in the long run , there is this connection between human rights , democracy and peace .
you can not have a more permanent peace if we have governments that more or less systematically suppress their population .
what do you reply when china says : we still have peace in china .
why do you give the peace prize to a person who disturbs the existing peace ?
let me say in a broader perspective that the norwegian nobel committee believes in many different roads to peace .
this is why we have many different kinds of peace prize laureates .
we believe that the statesmen and the politicians can certainly contribute .
we believe that the human rights activists can contribute and the great humanitarians and humanitarian organizations – those who work for arms control and disarmament .
there is even a connection between the environment and peace .
so there are many different individuals , many different ideas that can contribute to peace .
do you think that the chinese government is not contributing to peace if they try to silence critical voices within the country ?
china has made tremendous progress , which i think we all appreciate .
the economic growth in china has been tremendous .
and china has now become the second largest economy in the world .
hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty .
there is more openness than there was some decades ago .
but there are certain international treaties and there are clauses even in the chinese constitution – i am referring to article 35 and 41 in particular – where the chinese government itself addresses the importance of human rights .
and at a time when china has become so important in international affairs , i think these chinese leaders should expect to be held accountable to the treaties they have signed or ratified and to the relevant clauses in their own constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 11.10.2010 germany coach loew could end ' special relationship ' with podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , left , is the weak link in a great midfield as germany try to keep their perfect euro 2012 qualification record intact against minnows kazakhstan on tuesday , the mood in the squad is buoyant .
but not everything 's hunky-dory in the house of loew . with one exception , joachim loew 's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat turkey 3-0 last friday .
in the 70th minute , the germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the turkish goal .
the culprit was lukas podolski .
the cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the turks , and that must have been particularly irritating to loew , who 's stayed loyal to podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the bundesliga .
it wasn ’ t just that podolski squandered the chance to seal the match , in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0 .
he was also generally ineffective on the left side , failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right , thomas mueller .
podolski - once one of german football 's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 world cup , raising the question of how long loew can stick with him .
and the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers .
bidding for spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against turkey , kroos probably collected some plus points with loew one player who definitely did impress on friday was toni kroos .
the bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured bastian schweinsteiger in a defensive , holding role .
the 20-year-old was playing out of position , but you would n't have known that , as he combined perfectly with real madrid 's sami khedira to disrupt the turks ' faltering thrusts forward .
with khedira , mueller and mesut oezil having cemented their places in germany 's starting eleven , schweinsteiger 's return will mean someone will have to yield .
after friday 's match , it was easy to see kroos , who 's good with both feet , being moved further upfield - and poldi being switched to the bench .
making matters worse for the player formerly known as prince poldi , there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time , but who could command a look next march , when loew will nominate a new team .
midfielder lewis holtby and winger andre schuerrle are currently ripping the bundesliga apart with mainz and have been mainstays of germany 's under-21 team .
loew boldly promoted youngsters like mueller and holger badstuber ahead of germany 's world cup campaign , and it would be in keeping with the coach 's stated philosophy , if he bet again on youth for poland and ukraine .
other problem areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann was adequate , but no more , on friday germany 's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for euro 2012 .
loew also has to put together a team capable of beating spain , the nation that has dumped the nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments .
as good as germany 's midfield is , the squad wo n't be able to better the spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as xavi and iniesta .
if the germans are to put this bete noire - or perhaps better still bete rouge - behind them , they will have to excel all over the pitch .
and the squad still has some notable weaknesses .
heiko westermann did an okay job at left back against turkey , but that 's clearly not his natural position .
the same applies to badstuber and jerome boateng , who 's only starting to recover his form after injury .
that problem dogged germany at the world cup , and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason loew 's men came up short against spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is irreplaceable right now another potential concern is center-forward .
despite a prolonged goal drought in the bundesliga , miroslav klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt .
but klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in poland and ukraine , and it 's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt .
cacau is a different sort of forward , while stefan kiessling is injured long term , and mario gomez seems to have completely lost the plot .
and a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system loew employed to such effect in south africa .
unfortunately for loew , there are n't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the bundesliga .
if that situation does n't change , germany 's embarrassment of riches in midfield might not be enough for loew to achieve his stated aim for 2012 - leading the team to their first major international title since 1996 .

" german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the fdp , called for a " rational integration and migration policy - not an intentional simplification and populist debate over an end to migration . ongoing debate since august , a debate has been raging in germany after thilo sarrazin , a prominent central banker , who later resigned , said the country was being made " dumber " by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants and their children . german president christian wulff further fanned the flames on october 3 by saying at celebrations marking 20 years of german reunification that islam had become " a part of germany , " earning him sharp rebukes from conservatives . bildunterschrift : most germans take umbrage at the perceived lack of integration by muslim immigrants the state premier of hesse , volker bouffier , rejected wulff 's assessment saying , " islam did not belong to the foundations of our republic , " and that germany did not need to change , but rather the islamic immigrants . a representative survey carried out by the emnid polling institute last week for focus magazine , prior to erdogan 's visit , revealed that 60 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey . in another poll conducted by emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper during the same period , 59 percent believed the large majority of muslims living in germany were unwilling to accept and respect the german constitution . author : gabriel borrud , gregg benzow -lrb- reuters / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

where was the eu when prevention mattered ?
i do hope that all hungarian officials will face severe penalties , including jail , for their horrible acts of neglect , abuse and murder ! - emma , us please bring in the army to help .
the villages downstream must be prepared to move to higher ground .
a rental company of trucks could help move materials and the train system could carry the soil to be burned .
gps should be used to send information to a command center and follow the water movement with google earth . - malcolm , canada if hungary is so concerned over the availability of drinkable water , why has it sold the rights to nestle to take water from the kali basin by the thousands of gallons daily ?
this well is only 25 miles or so from the toxic sludge spill .
i question any country 's carelessness that is so willing to sell precious resources such as drinkable water at this time . - emmie , us there is a way to manage river water flow in a way to help minimize the spread and provide ph neutralization .
but i 'll be needed to be heard at the highest levels .
this is europe 's deepwater horizon , in my view . - vivek , india while the results of investigation of the causes of the catastrophe are not yet known , it seem that the mal zrt. company must bear full responsibility for the disaster .
while it is hard to say if the measures taken by hungarian authorities have been the best possible , i am impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of hungarian catastrophe teams .
it is sad to see , however , that some actors of international media are trying to create panic rather than contribute to objective communication . - borisz , hungary of course enough is not being done to prevent a second spill if there are fears of new toxic spill .
now we can barely hear the strauss 's vals " the blue danube , " next month we will hear from a metal band : “ the toxic danube . ”

cities like duesseldorf and cologne , the two leading cities in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , are eager to show investors from india that they are most welcome .
they have promised that indian businessmen never have to wait longer than four weeks to obtain residence and work permits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's cheapest car ' nano ' by tata motors this policy seems to have paid off .
about 100 indian companies are based in germany 's most populous state .
90 percent of these have been acquired in recent years from german owners .
tapan chattopadhyay , the head of the indian business delegation , says that germany with its state-of-the-art technology can help indian companies enormously " in fact a lot of indian companies have invested in germany .
to be precise : tata and other leading industrialists have opted for germany , " he explains . german-indian technology transfer for the last 15 years india 's industry has been contributing 17 percent to the country 's gross domestic product .
in order to increase this share , the country is partnering with key industrial nations around the world . but there is another reason why indian politicians and business leaders are especially attracted to europe 's largest economic power .
apart from the technology transfer germany can help indian companies in upgrading knowledge .
" in india , because a large slice of the population is between 20 to 30 , there is a great scope of upgrading their technological skills , " says tapan chattopadhyay , " it may be in the field of agriculture , it may be in the field of services , in the field of engineering .
and also clean technology , green technology , which india has been striving to adopt . " upgrading skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technology transfer : germany 's former president horst koehler with indian minister of science and technology prithviraj chavan outstanding vocational training is the key to germany 's success in today 's globalized economy , the indian entrepreneurs and decision-makers visiting germany kept repeating .
according to indian government figures , only 25 percent of the indian workforce is trained . dirk matter , duesseldorf representative of the indo-german chamber of commerce , thinks both countries will benefit when they ramp up their trade relations .
for example , when india 's famous low-cost car , the tata nano , was developed , 35 german suppliers and technology partners were involved .
and they make money on each unit sold . india emerging economic world power according to matter , people in germany should take india seriously as an emerging economic world power .
but he adds that they should not panic when indian companies take over german firms . " due to the global financial crisis , many german companies were undervalued in 2009 .
and indian businessmen were clever enough to take the opportunity and buy into the german industrial sector .
not to outsource and off-shore production , nor to cut back on jobs .
but to get access to german technology , to understand our marketing strategies . " excluding oil imports from arab countries , germany already ranks third behind china and the us amongst india ’ s most important suppliers .

economic growth , he added , is expected to be between 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent . mersch also rejected the notion that that ecb would not be able to continue with an exit from its current accommodative monetary policy if other central banks did not follow .

cities like duesseldorf and cologne , the two leading cities in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , are eager to show investors from india that they are most welcome .
they have promised that indian businessmen never have to wait longer than four weeks to obtain residence and work permits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's cheapest car ' nano ' by tata motors this policy seems to have paid off .
about 100 indian companies are based in germany 's most populous state .
90 percent of these have been acquired in recent years from german owners .
tapan chattopadhyay , the head of the indian business delegation , says that germany with its state-of-the-art technology can help indian companies enormously " in fact a lot of indian companies have invested in germany .
to be precise : tata and other leading industrialists have opted for germany , " he explains . german-indian technology transfer for the last 15 years india 's industry has been contributing 17 percent to the country 's gross domestic product .
in order to increase this share , the country is partnering with key industrial nations around the world . but there is another reason why indian politicians and business leaders are especially attracted to europe 's largest economic power .
apart from the technology transfer germany can help indian companies in upgrading knowledge .
" in india , because a large slice of the population is between 20 to 30 , there is a great scope of upgrading their technological skills , " says tapan chattopadhyay , " it may be in the field of agriculture , it may be in the field of services , in the field of engineering .
and also clean technology , green technology , which india has been striving to adopt . " upgrading skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technology transfer : germany 's former president horst koehler with indian minister of science and technology prithviraj chavan outstanding vocational training is the key to germany 's success in today 's globalized economy , the indian entrepreneurs and decision-makers visiting germany kept repeating .
according to indian government figures , only 25 percent of the indian workforce is trained . dirk matter , duesseldorf representative of the indo-german chamber of commerce , thinks both countries will benefit when they ramp up their trade relations .
for example , when india 's famous low-cost car , the tata nano , was developed , 35 german suppliers and technology partners were involved .
and they make money on each unit sold . india emerging economic world power according to matter , people in germany should take india seriously as an emerging economic world power .
but he adds that they should not panic when indian companies take over german firms . " due to the global financial crisis , many german companies were undervalued in 2009 .
and indian businessmen were clever enough to take the opportunity and buy into the german industrial sector .
not to outsource and off-shore production , nor to cut back on jobs .
but to get access to german technology , to understand our marketing strategies . " excluding oil imports from arab countries , germany already ranks third behind china and the us amongst india ’ s most important suppliers .
but the fact that india is only number 26 among germany ’ s trade partners has to be changed . author : thomas kohlmann editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barbara stamm , president of the bavarian state parliament , and gerda hasselfeldt , vice-president of the bundestag , are two examples of csu women who rose through the ranks without a quota to help them .

the fact that some of the strongest opposition to gender quotas comes from young women might seem ironic , but kuerschner says it is relatively easy for young women to get into leadership roles on the local level .

we take a last look around the museum before its closure .
the museum sits on the banks of the river clyde at braehead , part of the scottish maritime museum .
artefacts including the coaster mv kyles will be moved to the main museum in irvine when clydebuilt closes .
clydebuilt celebrates the shipbuilding and seafaring heritage of the river clyde .
maritime activity on the clyde can be easily glimpsed from the museum .
mv kyles was built in 1862 .
the diesel-powered coaster was used for a number of roles in her history - cargo transporter , fishing fleet tender and sand and sludge dredger .
clydebuilt was built by capital shopping centres in 2000 , a condition of the braehead shopping centre lease .
funding has now been withdrawn by the firm due to the economic downturn .
museum displays give an insight into the heyday of scottish shipbuilding .
this model of mv rangitane shows an example of the type of ships built on the clyde .
the mv rangitane , built in 1949 , was broken up in 1976 .
all that remains is this model and the records of her construction .
clydebuilt is ideally located to give a flavour of the history of shipbuilding on the clyde .
steam engines , models and the sounds of the shipyards help illustrate the shipbuilding heritage of scotland 's west coast .

the list was drawn up from nominations from members of the public .
it follows a nationwide appeal to find the country 's best and most threatened victorian and edwardian buildings .
but the owners of the school have said it is not at risk and is being refurbished .
hammerton street school was built on ouseburn road in 1904 for the sheffield school board by local architect , wj hale .
also known as kettlebridge school , the building was grade ii listed in 1995 .
built in honey-coloured stone , in the arts and crafts style , the school also has some baroque features .
director of the victorian society , dr ian dungavell , believes it is a fine example of the architecture of the period : " once they are gone historic buildings like these can not be replaced .
" hammerton street school is an absolute treasure .
" it 's got really nice details , like very prominent chimneys or ventilation shafts and little roundels - a round ornament with leaves around it and words in it , saying what they hoped to achieve by the education .
roundels above the school entrances stated some of the qualities pupils were expected to display " at that stage , there were separate entrances for the girls and the boys .
" above the girls ' entrance were written virtues like purity , sincerity and modesty .
" and the boys ' entrance had things like courage and chivalry .
" it tells us quite a lot about our history and what education was aiming for then . "
" it 's vital that a new use is found for the school , as the longer it lies empty the harder it will be to save . "
the building ceased to be a school in 1994 and was used as a community centre for a while but was badly damaged in a fire in 1997 .
the current owners are the madni trust , an educational charity , which operates schools in tinsley and in nottingham .
zaheer rhaman , operations manager , rejected the victorian society 's claims that the building is endangered and said work has been carried out to repair the school : " when we purchased the building from the city council , it was in a dilapidated state .
" all the windows were put through and there was actually a fire prior to us purchasing the property .
" since then we 've put a brand new roof on the building , costing hundreds of thousands of pounds .
" because the building is listed , we could n't put aluminium window frames in , we had to have a special type of wood and a joiner who could build the victorian style windows .
the building was badly damaged by fire in 1997 " so that took us a while to find a suitable joiner who knew what he was doing .
" and we 're a charity so we 've had to raise the funds to do this .
" all of this takes time but we 've been working closely with the city council for the last few years to bring the building back into use .
" the roof is completed and internal works have started , plastering , rendering , heating .
zaheer rahman estimates the repairs will be finished by easter 2011 and then a decision will be made on how the building will be used : " we have plans to put it back into community use .

the victorian society has listed the wedgwood institute in burslem as one of the 10 most endangered buildings in england and wales .
the society says the grade ii-listed building , which has been empty since the library moved out two years ago , has been badly neglected .
they have now called on the city council to do emergency repairs .
" our heritage is a finite resource and even in harsh economic times , historic buildings like the wedgwood institute need to be cared for or they wo n't survive for future generations , " said dr ian dungavell , director of the victorian society .
remarkable building dr dungavell told bbc radio stoke : " it is the most remarkable building .
do n't forget , this is the wedgwood institute and wedgwood is perhaps the potter that people know best in this country .
" and this was put up as a memorial to him in the 1860s and was paid for by public subscriptions , so in a way , it is a building that belongs to all of us . "
video bbc midlands today report about the wedgwood institute featuring local historian fred hughes " this is a building which desperately needs to be brought back into use , " he added .
the victorian society campaigns to preserve important victorian and edwardian buildings and landscapes .
to be eligible for the list , a building has to be at risk , whether from demolition , insensitive development or as in the case of the wedgwood institute , lack of use and neglect .
the list was drawn up from nominations from members of the public .
it follows a nationwide appeal to find the country 's best and most threatened buildings .
english heritage many weeds are now growing out of brickwork in response , the city council says that english heritage has carried out a survey on the building and they 've been told that the original frontage is fine but there are certain parts of the building , which were added on in the 19th century , that are n't up to the standard .
and while they may look nice , they 're effectively beyond restoration because of how many millions it would cost .
the council says that english heritage has now given them permission to demolish those parts .
stoke-on-trent city council insist that they 're trying to attract developers and make it worth their while to restore for commercial use .
julian read , regeneration manager for burslem , told bbc radio stoke : " the condition of the building is a concern for the council and at the moment we are bringing forward a regeneration package where we 're actually asking for designers and developers to come forward with ideas to help us regenerate this building . "
it 's part of a wider project for burslem , including the victorian indoor market and the old town hall .
institute factfile the wedgwood institute was built by r. edgar and john lockwood kipling - the father of rudyard kipling - and took six years to complete .
incredibly detailed tiles adorn the front of the building it stands on the site of the brick house pottery works which was rented by josiah wedgwood from 1762 to 1770 - this was the second of his potworks in burslem .
the foundation stone was laid by the future prime minister - william gladstone in 1863 .
on the front there are twelve huge terracotta tiles depicting the months of the year -lrb- pictured right -rrb- - as well as carvings of the people of the potteries and a statue of josiah wedgwood .
the institute was built with public funds - with the aim of making arts , science and literature available to all - and was designed to be the main centre for arts activity in the six towns of the potteries .
during the late 19th century the institute played its part in producing the ceramic artist , william moorcroft ; the author , arnold bennett ; and the pioneer of radio , oliver lodge .
it continued as a successful seat of learning in its own right through most of the 20th century - before becoming an annex for staffordshire university and then stoke-on-trent college .
until recently the wedgwood institute was home to burslem 's public library , but two years ago it closed due to structural problems .

bbc news - simmonds shares her success stories with school report british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news news front page school report teachers ' resources student reports school report 2012 school report first click project news useful links contact us related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 15:53 gmt , monday , 11 october 2010 16:53 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version simmonds shares her success stories with school report ellie simmonds , winner of bbc young sports personality of the year 2008 , shares some of her sporting success stories with school reporters by megan , macsen , elin and sarah from ysgol gyfun gwyr and gymraeg bryn tawe , swansea they say that good things come in small packages and , after meeting ellie simmonds , it 's clearly true !
ellie is a paralympic swimmer and world champion .
at just 15 years old , she can say she has won two gold medals , broken numerous world records , won the bbc young sports personality of the year and met the queen - and she 's only in her fourth year of secondary school .
at the 2008 paralympics games in beijing , ellie broke the 100m and 400m women 's freestyle at the tender age of 13 - an amazing achievement , we 're sure you 'll agree !
recently , we were lucky enough to catch up with ellie at our national pool in swansea - the centre of her world .
training schedule ellie trains at the 50m pool nine times a week for two hours at a time , yet she still finds time for school and friends .
originally from walsall , she now lives in swansea with her mum for training purposes and travels to walsall at the weekend .
we asked her how she felt about the distance between swansea and her family .
she said : " it 's just my mum and i in the week and the routine is that we travel home on the weekend .
it 's a three-hour trip which is hard but it 's worth it . "
it 's hard to imagine how a 15-year old can handle such a busy life while still studying for her gcses , swimming nine times a week and making time for a social life .
but as ellie explains , she " juggles " everything .
teenage confession she also confesses to taking time out to watch big brother : " i know it 's really bad to admit but i used to be addicted to it , i used to watch it all the time ! " .
we all laughed about it and decided her addiction is a normal teenage thing !
ellie was awarded an mbe in the 2009 new year 's honours list , becoming the youngest person to have ever received one .
" it was very exciting " she explained .
" at first i received a letter and was only allowed to tell two people - my mum and dad .
it was hard because it 's the sort of thing you want to tell everyone ! "
ellie 's rise to public awareness has been somewhat meteoric following her astounding success at the beijing paralympics in 2008 .
she describes her wins as overwhelming : " the buzz you get is amazing ! "
ellie won two gold medals in the pool at the paralympics in beijing ellie went on to tell us that she keeps her medals " in a box somewhere " and explained how she is looking forward to the london 2012 : " yes , i 'm very excited about london 2012 , " she said , " and if the british crowd respond to team gb like the chinese responded to their team , the buzz will be amazing . "
award winner the bbc award is something ellie is obviously very proud of .
she won the bbc young sports personality award in 2008 , beating another young sporting sensation , tom daley .
ellie said " winning it was great , it was really shocking actually " .
she told us about her excitement the night she won , about meeting lewis hamilton and the glitz and glamour of the award .
" it 's really nice getting all dressed up with the make-up and fancy hair and stuff , " she said .
despite being a record-breaking gold medallist ellie simmonds is refreshingly down to earth and humble .
we are sure she 'll go on to do even greater things in the future because as we said , good things come in small packages !

adam has had dogs , and a number of other animals , around him all his life - and has worked with the rspca for around 10 years .
at the moment , he is waiting for his own dog to join him from new zealand - so this one , " fargo " kept him company for the day .
the state-of-the-art kennels are currently full and can cater for 36 dogs .
twelve of the kennels specifically care for cruelty-case animals which can often need to be housed for protracted periods .
the staff give all the love , care and attention that is needed to bring some of the animals back from the brink - but this dog is swiftly improving .
a close record of daily life is kept on all of the dogs and cats at the centre .
the dogs here can have all manner of secrets of their former homes , but the rspca staff are there to re-train them back to home life .
anyone who would like to re-home a dog or cat should get in touch with their office on 0300 123 0708 .
" rocky " , a male rottweiler-type dog , came into rspca care after being found abandoned in wheatley hill , county durham .
he had a thick metal chain embedded in his neck and needed an immediate operation to remove it - but all 's well that ends well ...
today , " rocky " is a healthy dog once again , after a great deal of love and attention from the rspca .
anyone interested in meeting any of the dogs available for adoption should call rspca felledge animal centre on 0300 123 0708 or drop in .
opening hours are 11.30 - 3.00 every day apart from wednesdays .
the felledge animal centre also has excellent facilities for cats - they too are looking for homes .
close by , is the rspca felledge equine centre where a number of horses that have been maltreated are stabled .
if anyone is interested in re-homing one , then they can only be seen through an appointment .
of course , the centre does n't run itself - there is an extremely dedicated team of highly skilled people to ensure the very best for all the animals that pass through their gates .

the water was rising rapidly and it was a race against time to get to safety .
ruth was trying to collect her children from their grandparents ' house .
in the end , it would take her three days .
she was the last person across the town 's central phoenix bridge before it was closed - too treacherous to cross .
" frightening " to many people in lewes , the days of torrential rain in october 2000 , which led to 600 homes being evacuated , are often known as simply " the flood " .
barrels of beer went floating up the river ouse , cars were completely submerged and emergency workers were forced to smash their way into people 's homes to rescue them from the rising water .
in pictures : the lewes floods of 2000 - images from local people .
ruth was with her eldest daughter , who was 12 at the time .
anyone in lewes who was n't actually flooded probably felt quite guilty about it , like the survivors of an aeroplane crash ruth o 'keeffe " my daughter siobhan and i got in this police van and he started driving , " she said .
" as he came round the corner into orchard road , the ambulance that was ahead of us radioed back - ' we 're floating mate , we 're floating , ' and they sounded really panicky .
" then he said ' look i 'm sorry , if they 're floating in the ambulance we ca n't go down there , we 'll have to go back down the hill ' .
" so we went back down the hill which by now had a puddle at the bottom of it as well .
we were standing around and someone went off to rescue the people in the ambulance which was in the most deeply flooded bit and we were standing by the roundabout wondering what to do next . "
the picture of the floating ambulance later became synonymous with the floods and was even used by the wwf on a poster highlighting climate change .
then things got even more dramatic .
" the voice came through on the radio again - the policeman said the water was coming up the cuilfail tunnel and we 'd have to move fast .
we looked down it and you could see this shimmery dark thing coming up the tunnel towards us .
" the policeman grabbed my daughter 's hand and then we ran , across the phoenix bridge back toward lewes . '
" my daughter was 12 at the time , but she remembers it quite clearly .
she said as she was running across it was so frightening but she could n't resist looking down .
" you could see the water was almost up to the top of the archway , the pavement and the road .
we ran across and did n't realise we were the last people to cross that bridge for quite some time because they said it was unsafe . "
" big scar " after that , ruth 's daughter refused to go back to their house and sought higher ground , at the home of a school friend and her parents .
ruth , though , stayed up , watching the water encroach from all directions , and later went to the town hall to hand out blankets and comfort those whose possessions were now floating in a sea of mud .
a year on , many people who had been evacuated were still not back home .
millions of pounds has since been spent on flood defence work ruth said : " i think anyone in lewes who was n't actually flooded probably felt quite guilty about it , like the survivors of an aeroplane crash .
" it leaves a big scar on you forever if you 've had to go back to a property where all your belongings are floating round in scummy water , especially for older people who had photo albums , things they could n't restore digitally or rescue or find again . "
the town had been hit by flooding in november 1960 , although not to the same extent .
since 2000 , millions of pounds has been spent on defences by the environment agency , but when heavy rain is predicted people still cast a wary eye at the river ouse .
ruth adds : " the problem is , of course , unless you have a flood defence for absolutely everywhere the water does n't really respect it , it will go round it .
" we are better off than we were and there are quite large bits of the town with what is supposed to be one in 200 year flood protection - but of course every year it 's a one in 200 chance - it does n't mean it 'll take 200 years before the town floods again . "
to mark the anniversary an exhibition has been organised in the town by artemis arts .
the iconic photos of harveys , the brewery , with its infamous floating beer barrels , and lifeboat crews paddling down the streets in an inflatable dinghy , are all on display - to " celebrate the courage and resilience of the people who lived though it " , says ruth .
