one search engine has a remedy . sitting at your computer looking for gossip on lady gaga , plane flights to bangkok , or whether those worrying symptoms of yours really are signs of a deadly disease might seem harmless enough .
but with each click on google , you are actually pumping more co2 into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
“ conducting a search produces carbon dioxide because search engines operate with huge servers , ” said sophie fabricius of co2-online , a consultancy that looks at climate questions as they relate to the internet .
those servers , she adds , run on energy generated with fossil fuels .
the carbon footprint is gigantic .
but for those wishing to bring their own carbon footprint down to size and do a bit for the environment , the german search engine ecosia promises guilt-free clicking .
launched during the copenhagen climate conference in december 2009 , for almost a year ecosia has been attempting to carve green space out of the huge market share enjoyed by the california-based giant , which is so ubiquitous that it has become a verb .
while no one is ecosia-ing just yet , over 100,000 people a day are using its searches to save the amazon rain forest .
click and donate ecosia was founded by 26-year-old christian kroll , who has set up his search engine 's servers to run on green energy .
the site uses the technology of yahoo and bing , and as with most search inquiries , users see regular results along with so-called " sponsored links , " or advertising .
when someone clicks on one of these sponsored links , yahoo , bing and ecosia earn money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google servers are responsible for a good deal of co2 however , ecosia is donating 80 percent of its revenue to the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- and its amazon rainforest project .
kroll hopes to counteract the damage done by search engine servers with a contribution to protect the amazon rainforest , which plays a major role in absorbing co2 from the atmosphere , thus slowing global warming .
" the cutting down of rain forests is behind some 20 percent of the rise in co2 emissions , " kroll said .
" so i asked myself if i could n't use my knowledge about search engines to protect the rainforest . "
ecosia is not his first eco-venture .
he had previously founded another environmentally conscious website called forestle , which was popular in germany , but failed to gain international traction .
according to ecosia , each green search saves almost two square meters of the amazon rainforest .
and over a year , through ecosia searches an average internet user can protect about 2,000 square meters of forest - a little more than the size of an ice hockey rink .
the company reports it has donated close to 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 162,000 -rrb- to the wwf and , in total , saved over 207,250,000 square meters of the amazon .
" imagine what you can do with 130,000 euros in a protected area like this , a lot , " said christian plaep , a manager of the wwf 's amazon project in brazil .
bildunterschrift : destruction of the amazon rainforest damages a crucial co2 sink for example , he added that , it can finance carpentry training workshops and trainers to help the local population develop alternative income sources that do not harm the ecosystem .
ecosia calls its search engine the world 's greenest , although it operates in an increasingly crowded field .
the green search sector includes players like ecosearch , goodsearch and goodtree , which all donate to environmental causes .
sites like treehoo and ecocho allow uses the possibility to carbon-offset their searches .
greenwashing ?
some have been critical of these green sites , saying some of their claims are more of a marketing gimmick than anything else .
a review on the website search engine news from earlier this year complained that ecosia 's claims that each click on its search engine was saving the rain forest could not be verified , and was misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each ecosia search will save a chunk of rainforest , the company says telling users that each click on a sponsored link results in a donation to wwf , and , perhaps , saves some of the amazon would have been more accurate , the review said .
" the claim is excessive , and should n't be as simplified , " wrote reviewer joe eitel .
" many factors go into these types of donations including ultimately , how successful they end up being . "
new models , different strategies still , christian kroll is determined to do something for the environment , and in addition he is interested in exploring new business models .
" i find this thinking about social business very interesting , " he said .
" it helps make the market economy - perhaps even capitalism itself - sustainable .
we can solve problems using the existing -lrb- market-oriented -rrb- system that otherwise would have to be solved using donations . "
no one is claiming ecosia.org is going to save the environment , and one has to wonder if it can even survive against a giant like google or if it will end up in the search engine graveyard , or at least obscurity , with the likes of altavista or lycos .
" we estimate that on average a german generates 10 to 12 tons of co2 per year , " said consultant fabricius .
" if we calculate what one saves by doing searches on ecosia , the reduction is about 15 to 20 kilos . "
that 's a tiny toe on a very big carbon footprint .
" people have to think of other ways to save co2 in their daily lives as well , " she said .

but non-us firms are already legally giving money to both parties . us president barack obama has hit out at the republican party for allegedly accepting funds from foreign companies .
he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .

steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .

the blue-eyed soul singer says he wo n't stop performing till people do n't want to see him , but he " has n't got there yet . " four decades since joe cocker 's legendary breakthrough at woodstock , he still captivates audiences .
his wild days of drug and alcohol addiction are behind him , replaced by more pastoral pursuits , like running an ice cream parlor , vegetable farming and visits to the doctor .
but even at 66 , the rocker still loves the energy he feels onstage . joe cocker spoke with deutsche welle about his 21st studio album , " hard knocks , ” and his special relationship to german fans . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring joe cocker . deutsche welle : " hard knocks " is n't just the name of a song .
it 's also the title of your new album .
could it also be a kind of caption describing your eventful life and career ? joe cocker : that song got the ball rolling for the album .
a guy named marc broussard from new orleans wrote it .
he worked with crayfish for a living before becoming a singer .
we modified the original words , and he rewrote some of the second verse .
there are lines like " i got my education on the street . "
in sheffield , england , when i was growing up , i spent around five years just playing the pubs .
it was n't a gang-land kind of street life but that kind of streetwise thing you developed when you were hanging out all the time .
so it 's a bit autobiographical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocker 's performance at woodstock in 1969 was a career breakthrough how did your youth shape who you 've come to be ? i did n't go to university .
i had an older brother who was really bright and became the head of the water company .
we grew up in a very northern , working-class house .
my parents kind of gave up on me .
they thought " he 'll do this for a bit and then get a regular job . "
i had a record out in ' 64 , and i did an early cover of the beatles called " i 'll cry instead . "
it did n't even chart . it was a bit like the old days of -lsb- tv talent shows -rsb- german idol or american idol .
people said , " you 've had your go .
hard luck . "
i fear for a lot of these kids in those competitions because suddenly after all that attention , there 's nothing .
but i 'd had a taste of that life and hung in until later in the 60 's when the scene changed . how did you feel receiving the royal honor of " officer of the order of the british empire " a few years ago ? i went to buckingham palace and did my little bow .
prince charles stands on a box you know , which is kind of strange .
my brother had received " commander of the order of the british empire . "
but i was totally staggered because i 'd been living in america for so long .
i did n't really think they would bestow that kind of thing upon a " foreigner . "
they said it was for my contribution to music . afterwards , i imagined all those guys in sheffield in the pub seeing the announcement on tv .
they probably spewed out their beer .
that was kind of a cheeky afterthought . what happened to your eyesight while recording your recent album ? i was in the middle of doing a session in which i was singing a song in two different keys .
i always keep a chart on the side and when i looked over , i could n't see .
the words just went away from the page .
everyone in the studio said , " you 'll be fine , do n't worry about it . " so i carried on working , and the morning after , the doctor told me i 'd had a stroke of the eye .
the experts think it 'll eventually sort itself out but i know it 's a rock ' n ' roll wound .
the doctors insisted that it could n't have been the singing that caused it .
but in my heart , i think that brought it on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans thanked cocker by taking his new album to number one in the charts you have nearly 20 shows scheduled in germany .
is this country especially important to you ? definitely .
in those rough years , the german fans were remarkable .
i used to have nights where i 'd do shows with terrible hangovers that used to make it really hard to perform back then .
i 'd have a couple of really great nights , then a couple of bad ones .
through the bad ones , the german fans would always be there .
i kind of owe them something back . by the time i got to " unchain my heart , " i got this following .
i could n't believe that i 'd gotten through the dark patch and suddenly everything was rosy again .
the fans were great .
i 've had this rapport with them ever since .
we go to other countries .
now we do a lot in russia , latvia , we go into all those new territories .
but there 's something about a german audience . my band all agree .
i think it 's my affinity with oompah music .
i love those shows that i always see on german tv with the guys with all the bavarian rig on .
everything 's got that straight beat .
i do n't know if that affinity 's got to do with that thing that 's inside you all or not , but i 'm just grateful for it . interview : deborah friedman editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .

i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .

" italy has a dignity that can not be jeopardized across the world , " bersani added .

the italian premier admitted to helping ruby after her arrest , but denied having interfered with the justice system .
scandals about berlusconi 's private life have hit the headlines regularly in italy , with a series of scandals in 2009 leading to his wife veronica lario filing for divorce .
while berlusconi 's approval ratings have fallen gradually to below 40 percent , his minority right-wing government remains comfortably ahead of its left-wing opposition in the polls .

italian media reports say that the girl , a dancer , told officers she had attended several sex parties in at berlusconi 's villa in arcore , near milan , although she denies having a sexual relationship with the italian premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers are again filled with allegations it is also alleged that the prime minister intervened to secure her release from custody .

wulff praised gorbachev 's current work and likened his efforts to change attitudes to the environment to his policy of " perestroika " - or restructuring - in the former soviet union during the 1980s .
" today you work with an admirable passion for a global ecological perestroika , for a move to a greater conservation of resources and more energy efficiency and for a way of living in harmony with nature rather than against it , " said wulff . climate change and contamination after the collapse of the ussr , gorbachev turned his focus to environmental issues .

the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .

he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .
the suspect , an alleged al qaeda bomb maker from saudi arabia , has been known to work with petn before .
he is believed to be linked to a failed attack on a us-bound passenger plane last christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach said more terrorists are hiding out in yemen petn is considered highly explosive and can be detonated using extreme heat or a detonator . the suspect is thought to be hiding in yemen and is wanted for a series of high-profile attacks linked to al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula . wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the bundestag 's standing committee on interior affairs , said yemen is increasingly in focus when it comes to questions of security . " yemen has been developing into a fall-back location for terrorists , like the area on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung newspaper . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dapd , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one employee of the mail delivery service was taken to the hospital with light burns on her hands .
police said the two men , aged 22 and 24 , are believed to be linked to the greek far-left militant group whose name has been translated as fire conspiracy cells .
they were reportedly carrying handguns and wearing bullet-proof vests .
attacks targeting the government or the police are relatively frequent in greece and far-left groups have been blamed for a series of attacks since police killed a teenager in athens in december 2008 .
" the incident seems rather ridiculous , " police spokesman thanassis kokalakis told the afp wire service .
" in sarkozy 's case it 's quite evident that this parcel would never have reached its destination . "
earlier this year a letter bomb killed a government aide at the greek public order ministry .

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .
in an interview in monday 's tagesspiegel newspaper , herbert bodner , head of the federation of german industry , called for a review of takeover legislation .
" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .
" in germany we have a very liberal approach . "
but economics minister rainer bruederle , who last week ruled out any government intervention in the hochtief case , reiterated his position in monday 's edition of the leipziger volkszeitung .
" i think we would damage ourselves through short-sighted deliberation , " bruederle said .
" the important thing is that every company has the same chances in every country . "

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton began her visit of phnom penh with a trip to the tuol sleng genocide museum , where thousands were imprisoned , tortured and killed last week , hun sen told un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who was visiting , that the tribunal ’ s second case – that of four aging senior leaders of the khmer rouge – would be its last . the tribunal , of course , is meant to base its decisions on who to prosecute on the evidence , not on politicians ’ whims . focus on finding funding for case two clinton said the focus for now would be to secure funding for the next trial , which is scheduled to start next year . " we are in full agreement with the government of cambodia that case 002 should be brought to trial as soon as possible .
that is our first and most pressing piece of business .
there is not yet the funding available to do that trial .
the estimate is that somewhere between 46 and 50 million dollars will be needed . " however , the secretary of state failed to outline a us position on cambodia ’ s decision to end the tribunal after case two .
she said only that the international community , which funds the bulk of the tribunal ’ s work , should " consult closely " with phnom penh . " peace and stability in jeopardy " meanwhile , cambodian foreign minister hor namhong outlined the government ’ s concerns about further cases . " there is question of expanding prosecutions beyond case two to include lower-level khmer rouge cadres .
if the cases incorporate the next five people that could jeopardize the country ’ s peace and stability – and who would be responsible for that ? " if clinton failed to come out with an endorsement of the court ’ s supposed independence , she did go to bat for the un ’ s local human rights office .
she said it was a valuable resource and cited the technical assistance that it provides the government and ngos operating in cambodia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said she was impressed by cambodia 's ability to grapple with its past " the high commissioner 's office is active in ways that we think are very complementary to what the cambodian government is committed to doing , and we think the work is important and we would like to see it continue . " thorny issue of debt mentioned clinton also spoke about another thorny issue – what to do about the 445-million dollar debt phnom penh has owed washington for almost four decades . the debt stems from assistance given to the lon nol regime , which the us bankrolled prior to the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia in 1975 and cambodia has long called on the us to cancel it . clinton said a team of experts would head to cambodia to discuss the matter , adding that the us had no preconceived notions about the form a deal might take , but that there were a number of areas , which could be pursued . clinton 's next leg of her tour of the asia-pacific will see her in malaysia . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one employee of the mail delivery service was taken to the hospital with light burns on her hands .
police said the two men , aged 22 and 24 , are believed to be linked to the greek far-left militant group whose name has been translated as fire conspiracy cells .
they were reportedly carrying handguns and wearing bullet-proof vests .
attacks targeting the government or the police are relatively frequent in greece and far-left groups have been blamed for a series of attacks since police killed a teenager in athens in december 2008 .
" the incident seems rather ridiculous , " police spokesman thanassis kokalakis told the afp wire service .
" in sarkozy 's case it 's quite evident that this parcel would never have reached its destination . "
earlier this year a letter bomb killed a government aide at the greek public order ministry .

the blue-eyed soul singer says he wo n't stop performing till people do n't want to see him , but he " has n't got there yet . " four decades since joe cocker 's legendary breakthrough at woodstock , he still captivates audiences .
his wild days of drug and alcohol addiction are behind him , replaced by more pastoral pursuits , like running an ice cream parlor , vegetable farming and visits to the doctor .
but even at 66 , the rocker still loves the energy he feels onstage . joe cocker spoke with deutsche welle about his 21st studio album , " hard knocks , ” and his special relationship to german fans . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring joe cocker . deutsche welle : " hard knocks " is n't just the name of a song .
it 's also the title of your new album .
could it also be a kind of caption describing your eventful life and career ? joe cocker : that song got the ball rolling for the album .
a guy named marc broussard from new orleans wrote it .
he worked with crayfish for a living before becoming a singer .
we modified the original words , and he rewrote some of the second verse .
there are lines like " i got my education on the street . "
in sheffield , england , when i was growing up , i spent around five years just playing the pubs .
it was n't a gang-land kind of street life but that kind of streetwise thing you developed when you were hanging out all the time .
so it 's a bit autobiographical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocker 's performance at woodstock in 1969 was a career breakthrough how did your youth shape who you 've come to be ? i did n't go to university .
i had an older brother who was really bright and became the head of the water company .
we grew up in a very northern , working-class house .
my parents kind of gave up on me .
they thought " he 'll do this for a bit and then get a regular job . "
i had a record out in ' 64 , and i did an early cover of the beatles called " i 'll cry instead . "
it did n't even chart . it was a bit like the old days of -lsb- tv talent shows -rsb- german idol or american idol .
people said , " you 've had your go .
hard luck . "
i fear for a lot of these kids in those competitions because suddenly after all that attention , there 's nothing .
but i 'd had a taste of that life and hung in until later in the 60 's when the scene changed . how did you feel receiving the royal honor of " officer of the order of the british empire " a few years ago ? i went to buckingham palace and did my little bow .
prince charles stands on a box you know , which is kind of strange .
my brother had received " commander of the order of the british empire . "
but i was totally staggered because i 'd been living in america for so long .
i did n't really think they would bestow that kind of thing upon a " foreigner . "
they said it was for my contribution to music . afterwards , i imagined all those guys in sheffield in the pub seeing the announcement on tv .
they probably spewed out their beer .
that was kind of a cheeky afterthought . what happened to your eyesight while recording your recent album ? i was in the middle of doing a session in which i was singing a song in two different keys .
i always keep a chart on the side and when i looked over , i could n't see .
the words just went away from the page .
everyone in the studio said , " you 'll be fine , do n't worry about it . " so i carried on working , and the morning after , the doctor told me i 'd had a stroke of the eye .
the experts think it 'll eventually sort itself out but i know it 's a rock ' n ' roll wound .
the doctors insisted that it could n't have been the singing that caused it .
but in my heart , i think that brought it on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans thanked cocker by taking his new album to number one in the charts you have nearly 20 shows scheduled in germany .
is this country especially important to you ? definitely .
in those rough years , the german fans were remarkable .
i used to have nights where i 'd do shows with terrible hangovers that used to make it really hard to perform back then .
i 'd have a couple of really great nights , then a couple of bad ones .
through the bad ones , the german fans would always be there .
i kind of owe them something back . by the time i got to " unchain my heart , " i got this following .
i could n't believe that i 'd gotten through the dark patch and suddenly everything was rosy again .
the fans were great .
i 've had this rapport with them ever since .
we go to other countries .
now we do a lot in russia , latvia , we go into all those new territories .
but there 's something about a german audience . my band all agree .
i think it 's my affinity with oompah music .
i love those shows that i always see on german tv with the guys with all the bavarian rig on .
everything 's got that straight beat .
i do n't know if that affinity 's got to do with that thing that 's inside you all or not , but i 'm just grateful for it . interview : deborah friedman editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blue-eyed soul singer says he wo n't stop performing till people do n't want to see him , but he " has n't got there yet . " four decades since joe cocker 's legendary breakthrough at woodstock , he still captivates audiences .
his wild days of drug and alcohol addiction are behind him , replaced by more pastoral pursuits , like running an ice cream parlor , vegetable farming and visits to the doctor .
but even at 66 , the rocker still loves the energy he feels onstage . joe cocker spoke with deutsche welle about his 21st studio album , " hard knocks , ” and his special relationship to german fans . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring joe cocker . deutsche welle : " hard knocks " is n't just the name of a song .
it 's also the title of your new album .
could it also be a kind of caption describing your eventful life and career ? joe cocker : that song got the ball rolling for the album .
a guy named marc broussard from new orleans wrote it .
he worked with crayfish for a living before becoming a singer .
we modified the original words , and he rewrote some of the second verse .
there are lines like " i got my education on the street . "
in sheffield , england , when i was growing up , i spent around five years just playing the pubs .
it was n't a gang-land kind of street life but that kind of streetwise thing you developed when you were hanging out all the time .
so it 's a bit autobiographical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocker 's performance at woodstock in 1969 was a career breakthrough how did your youth shape who you 've come to be ? i did n't go to university .
i had an older brother who was really bright and became the head of the water company .
we grew up in a very northern , working-class house .
my parents kind of gave up on me .
they thought " he 'll do this for a bit and then get a regular job . "
i had a record out in ' 64 , and i did an early cover of the beatles called " i 'll cry instead . "
it did n't even chart . it was a bit like the old days of -lsb- tv talent shows -rsb- german idol or american idol .
people said , " you 've had your go .
hard luck . "
i fear for a lot of these kids in those competitions because suddenly after all that attention , there 's nothing .
but i 'd had a taste of that life and hung in until later in the 60 's when the scene changed . how did you feel receiving the royal honor of " officer of the order of the british empire " a few years ago ? i went to buckingham palace and did my little bow .
prince charles stands on a box you know , which is kind of strange .
my brother had received " commander of the order of the british empire . "
but i was totally staggered because i 'd been living in america for so long .
i did n't really think they would bestow that kind of thing upon a " foreigner . "
they said it was for my contribution to music . afterwards , i imagined all those guys in sheffield in the pub seeing the announcement on tv .
they probably spewed out their beer .
that was kind of a cheeky afterthought . what happened to your eyesight while recording your recent album ? i was in the middle of doing a session in which i was singing a song in two different keys .
i always keep a chart on the side and when i looked over , i could n't see .
the words just went away from the page .
everyone in the studio said , " you 'll be fine , do n't worry about it . " so i carried on working , and the morning after , the doctor told me i 'd had a stroke of the eye .
the experts think it 'll eventually sort itself out but i know it 's a rock ' n ' roll wound .
the doctors insisted that it could n't have been the singing that caused it .
but in my heart , i think that brought it on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans thanked cocker by taking his new album to number one in the charts you have nearly 20 shows scheduled in germany .
is this country especially important to you ? definitely .
in those rough years , the german fans were remarkable .
i used to have nights where i 'd do shows with terrible hangovers that used to make it really hard to perform back then .
i 'd have a couple of really great nights , then a couple of bad ones .
through the bad ones , the german fans would always be there .
i kind of owe them something back . by the time i got to " unchain my heart , " i got this following .
i could n't believe that i 'd gotten through the dark patch and suddenly everything was rosy again .
the fans were great .
i 've had this rapport with them ever since .
we go to other countries .
now we do a lot in russia , latvia , we go into all those new territories .
but there 's something about a german audience . my band all agree .
i think it 's my affinity with oompah music .
i love those shows that i always see on german tv with the guys with all the bavarian rig on .
everything 's got that straight beat .
i do n't know if that affinity 's got to do with that thing that 's inside you all or not , but i 'm just grateful for it . interview : deborah friedman editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 01.11.2010 acs head promises not to dismantle hochtief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is closer to being taken over than it would like spanish construction giant acs seeks to reassure hochtief workers that it will not break up the german company if its hostile takeover bid is successful . " we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .
in an interview in monday 's tagesspiegel newspaper , herbert bodner , head of the federation of german industry , called for a review of takeover legislation .
" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .
" in germany we have a very liberal approach . "
but economics minister rainer bruederle , who last week ruled out any government intervention in the hochtief case , reiterated his position in monday 's edition of the leipziger volkszeitung .
" i think we would damage ourselves through short-sighted deliberation , " bruederle said .
" the important thing is that every company has the same chances in every country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 01.11.2010 france begins sending out online piracy warning e-mails großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french fines could reach 1,500 euros after warnings the french agency hadopi may eventually cut users ' connection to the internet as punishment .
meanwhile , french internet advocacy groups say that there are alternatives to this litigious scheme . within the last few weeks , hadopi , the new french government agency charged with combating online piracy , has begun sending out thousands of warning e-mails on a daily basis to illegal file sharers around the country .
the controversial law works on a three-strike system .
after two warning letters , the hadopi agency then refers each case to a judge who can fine the offender up to 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,100 -rrb- and order the user 's internet connection to be cut for up to a month . the agency initially identifies possible copyright infringements via an industry-funded private company that monitors internet traffic and activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french music industry says that 700 million euros are lost to piracy every year legal battles brewing at least one person is already seeking legal advice after receiving an email , according to renaud veeckman , co-founder of sos hadopi , a group set up to defend people against the new law .
other internet freedom groups say the legislation is a dangerous step towards online censorship , and that trying to stop people sharing is hopeless task .
hadopi 's proponents say the aim is to change ordinary people 's attitude to file-sharing .
" pirates are not our target , " says david el sayegh , the director general of france 's biggest music trade organisation , snep .
" our target is the mainstream user who used to download illegally because it was more convenient for him .
the majority understand there are new legal offers . "
in france , there are many legal online venues for digital music , like apple 's itunes , and also , more recently , the french government 's new plan to offer a " music card " for 12-25 year-olds to buy digital music subsidized by the government .
despite those offerings , the scpp , a french trade association that represents companies including vivendi sa 's universal music group , sony music france and warner music france have said that internet piracy costs the french music industry 700 million euros -lrb- $ 978 million -rrb- per year .
online activists propose alternative still , even hadopi 's critics agree that artists need to be paid for their work .
" sharing is a benefit for most artists , " said maxime rouget , a spokesperson from the french pirate party .
" discovering an artist should not be illegal .
we suggest , for example , global licence ids where every citizen who wants to support artists can give a small amount of money each month . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are legal digital music alternatives , such as apple 's itunes service it 's not a battle between file-sharers who believe in the goodness of people versus authorities .
jérémie zimmermann , co-founder of la quadrature du net , another french internet advocacy group , believes the problem requires an economic rather than a legal solution .
" the internet must be seen as one big copy machine , " he says .
" the business model to fund creation based on selling copies is outdated .
when an industry brings on the market a service with an added value people buy it . "
he adds that more people will create virtual private networks and encrypt content , making it harder for police to find more serious criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy has spearheaded the hadopi law and agency other countries remain interested foreign governments are watching france 's progress with interest , and a certain ambivalence .
a conference on the internet and freedom of expression due to be co-hosted by france and the netherlands was postponed last week after two documents were leaked .
one was a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy to foreign minister bernard kouchner saying he relied on him to promote france 's pedagogical approach - the language often used to describe hadopi .
the other was a draft of a resolution that included references to online policing and was due to be put before delegates .
dutch internet users have pressured their government not to sign it , though the postponement was attributed to an agenda clash .
hadopi 's critics also maintain that the law is part of a larger plan to surveil the internet .
another related law , loppsi , is designed to catch terrorists and pedophiles , using more invasive online surveillance methods .
" we can see what will be the next step , " added rouget . " of course the aim is to extend the scope of the law .
first it will be child pornography , then terrorism , then copyrighted materials . "
but eric walter , hadopi ’ s secretary general , added that the agency wo n't go that far , and noted that hadopi is still in the early stages .
" that is a fear not a fact , " he said . " we have the obligation to make an evaluation of all the possibilities to protect content .
we 're just at the beginning of this work . "

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

but non-us firms are already legally giving money to both parties . us president barack obama has hit out at the republican party for allegedly accepting funds from foreign companies .
he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .

that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .
in an interview in monday 's tagesspiegel newspaper , herbert bodner , head of the federation of german industry , called for a review of takeover legislation .
" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .
" in germany we have a very liberal approach . "
but economics minister rainer bruederle , who last week ruled out any government intervention in the hochtief case , reiterated his position in monday 's edition of the leipziger volkszeitung .
" i think we would damage ourselves through short-sighted deliberation , " bruederle said .
" the important thing is that every company has the same chances in every country . "

but media activists say turkey continues to block thousands of other websites . on saturday , a turkish court lifted a three-year ban on youtube after material viewed as demeaning to the country 's modern founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , was taken off of the video-sharing website , according to the turkish state-run news agency , anatolian .
the ban had been widely criticized by internet advocates , free speech activists , and even the turkish president abdullah gul .
" we 've received reports that some users in turkey are once again able to access youtube , " the company , which is owned by google , wrote in a statement .
" we want to be clear that a third party , not youtube , has apparently removed some of the videos that have caused the blocking of youtube in turkey using our automated copyright complaint process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul had previously denounced the youtube ban turkey has continued to block other sites on june 4 , 2010 , turkey also blocked access to more than 30 google sites , some of which had been reconfigured so that turkish users could access youtube .
turkey has also fined youtube 15.6 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for not paying taxes in turkey on the advertising revenue generated by turkish youtube users prior to the ban .
some media organizations , and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a human rights group , have also urged turkey to pull back the country 's internet law , which was also adopted in june .
that piece of legislation was originally intended to block pornography and other content not suitable for children , but has since been expanded to encompass more than 5,000 websites .
" i ask the turkish authorities to revoke the blocking provisions that prevent citizens from being part of today 's global information society , " said dunja mijatovic , the osce 's media freedom representative , in a june message to turkey 's foreign minister ahmet davutoglu , adding that the law " considerably limits freedom of expression and severely restricts citizens ' right to access information .

but media activists say turkey continues to block thousands of other websites . on saturday , a turkish court lifted a three-year ban on youtube after material viewed as demeaning to the country 's modern founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , was taken off of the video-sharing website , according to the turkish state-run news agency , anatolian .
the ban had been widely criticized by internet advocates , free speech activists , and even the turkish president abdullah gul .

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

but non-us firms are already legally giving money to both parties . us president barack obama has hit out at the republican party for allegedly accepting funds from foreign companies .
he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .

one employee of the mail delivery service was taken to the hospital with light burns on her hands .
police said the two men , aged 22 and 24 , are believed to be linked to the greek far-left militant group whose name has been translated as fire conspiracy cells .
they were reportedly carrying handguns and wearing bullet-proof vests .
attacks targeting the government or the police are relatively frequent in greece and far-left groups have been blamed for a series of attacks since police killed a teenager in athens in december 2008 .
" the incident seems rather ridiculous , " police spokesman thanassis kokalakis told the afp wire service .
" in sarkozy 's case it 's quite evident that this parcel would never have reached its destination . "
earlier this year a letter bomb killed a government aide at the greek public order ministry .

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .

last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .

" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .

so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans .

he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .

" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .
" in germany we have a very liberal approach . "
but economics minister rainer bruederle , who last week ruled out any government intervention in the hochtief case , reiterated his position in monday 's edition of the leipziger volkszeitung .
" i think we would damage ourselves through short-sighted deliberation , " bruederle said .
" the important thing is that every company has the same chances in every country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '

it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .
the suspect , an alleged al qaeda bomb maker from saudi arabia , has been known to work with petn before .
he is believed to be linked to a failed attack on a us-bound passenger plane last christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach said more terrorists are hiding out in yemen petn is considered highly explosive and can be detonated using extreme heat or a detonator . the suspect is thought to be hiding in yemen and is wanted for a series of high-profile attacks linked to al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula . wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the bundestag 's standing committee on interior affairs , said yemen is increasingly in focus when it comes to questions of security . " yemen has been developing into a fall-back location for terrorists , like the area on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung newspaper . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dapd , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton began her visit of phnom penh with a trip to the tuol sleng genocide museum , where thousands were imprisoned , tortured and killed last week , hun sen told un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who was visiting , that the tribunal ’ s second case – that of four aging senior leaders of the khmer rouge – would be its last . the tribunal , of course , is meant to base its decisions on who to prosecute on the evidence , not on politicians ’ whims . focus on finding funding for case two clinton said the focus for now would be to secure funding for the next trial , which is scheduled to start next year . " we are in full agreement with the government of cambodia that case 002 should be brought to trial as soon as possible .
that is our first and most pressing piece of business .
there is not yet the funding available to do that trial .
the estimate is that somewhere between 46 and 50 million dollars will be needed . " however , the secretary of state failed to outline a us position on cambodia ’ s decision to end the tribunal after case two .
she said only that the international community , which funds the bulk of the tribunal ’ s work , should " consult closely " with phnom penh . " peace and stability in jeopardy " meanwhile , cambodian foreign minister hor namhong outlined the government ’ s concerns about further cases . " there is question of expanding prosecutions beyond case two to include lower-level khmer rouge cadres .
if the cases incorporate the next five people that could jeopardize the country ’ s peace and stability – and who would be responsible for that ? " if clinton failed to come out with an endorsement of the court ’ s supposed independence , she did go to bat for the un ’ s local human rights office .
she said it was a valuable resource and cited the technical assistance that it provides the government and ngos operating in cambodia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said she was impressed by cambodia 's ability to grapple with its past " the high commissioner 's office is active in ways that we think are very complementary to what the cambodian government is committed to doing , and we think the work is important and we would like to see it continue . " thorny issue of debt mentioned clinton also spoke about another thorny issue – what to do about the 445-million dollar debt phnom penh has owed washington for almost four decades . the debt stems from assistance given to the lon nol regime , which the us bankrolled prior to the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia in 1975 and cambodia has long called on the us to cancel it . clinton said a team of experts would head to cambodia to discuss the matter , adding that the us had no preconceived notions about the form a deal might take , but that there were a number of areas , which could be pursued . clinton 's next leg of her tour of the asia-pacific will see her in malaysia . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blue-eyed soul singer says he wo n't stop performing till people do n't want to see him , but he " has n't got there yet . " four decades since joe cocker 's legendary breakthrough at woodstock , he still captivates audiences .
his wild days of drug and alcohol addiction are behind him , replaced by more pastoral pursuits , like running an ice cream parlor , vegetable farming and visits to the doctor .
but even at 66 , the rocker still loves the energy he feels onstage . joe cocker spoke with deutsche welle about his 21st studio album , " hard knocks , ” and his special relationship to german fans . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring joe cocker . deutsche welle : " hard knocks " is n't just the name of a song .
it 's also the title of your new album .
could it also be a kind of caption describing your eventful life and career ? joe cocker : that song got the ball rolling for the album .
a guy named marc broussard from new orleans wrote it .
he worked with crayfish for a living before becoming a singer .
we modified the original words , and he rewrote some of the second verse .
there are lines like " i got my education on the street . "
in sheffield , england , when i was growing up , i spent around five years just playing the pubs .
it was n't a gang-land kind of street life but that kind of streetwise thing you developed when you were hanging out all the time .
so it 's a bit autobiographical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocker 's performance at woodstock in 1969 was a career breakthrough how did your youth shape who you 've come to be ? i did n't go to university .
i had an older brother who was really bright and became the head of the water company .
we grew up in a very northern , working-class house .
my parents kind of gave up on me .
they thought " he 'll do this for a bit and then get a regular job . "
i had a record out in ' 64 , and i did an early cover of the beatles called " i 'll cry instead . "
it did n't even chart . it was a bit like the old days of -lsb- tv talent shows -rsb- german idol or american idol .
people said , " you 've had your go .
hard luck . "
i fear for a lot of these kids in those competitions because suddenly after all that attention , there 's nothing .
but i 'd had a taste of that life and hung in until later in the 60 's when the scene changed . how did you feel receiving the royal honor of " officer of the order of the british empire " a few years ago ? i went to buckingham palace and did my little bow .
prince charles stands on a box you know , which is kind of strange .
my brother had received " commander of the order of the british empire . "
but i was totally staggered because i 'd been living in america for so long .
i did n't really think they would bestow that kind of thing upon a " foreigner . "
they said it was for my contribution to music . afterwards , i imagined all those guys in sheffield in the pub seeing the announcement on tv .
they probably spewed out their beer .
that was kind of a cheeky afterthought . what happened to your eyesight while recording your recent album ? i was in the middle of doing a session in which i was singing a song in two different keys .
i always keep a chart on the side and when i looked over , i could n't see .
the words just went away from the page .
everyone in the studio said , " you 'll be fine , do n't worry about it . " so i carried on working , and the morning after , the doctor told me i 'd had a stroke of the eye .
the experts think it 'll eventually sort itself out but i know it 's a rock ' n ' roll wound .
the doctors insisted that it could n't have been the singing that caused it .
but in my heart , i think that brought it on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans thanked cocker by taking his new album to number one in the charts you have nearly 20 shows scheduled in germany .
is this country especially important to you ? definitely .
in those rough years , the german fans were remarkable .
i used to have nights where i 'd do shows with terrible hangovers that used to make it really hard to perform back then .
i 'd have a couple of really great nights , then a couple of bad ones .
through the bad ones , the german fans would always be there .
i kind of owe them something back . by the time i got to " unchain my heart , " i got this following .
i could n't believe that i 'd gotten through the dark patch and suddenly everything was rosy again .
the fans were great .
i 've had this rapport with them ever since .
we go to other countries .
now we do a lot in russia , latvia , we go into all those new territories .
but there 's something about a german audience . my band all agree .
i think it 's my affinity with oompah music .
i love those shows that i always see on german tv with the guys with all the bavarian rig on .
everything 's got that straight beat .
i do n't know if that affinity 's got to do with that thing that 's inside you all or not , but i 'm just grateful for it . interview : deborah friedman editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .
the suspect , an alleged al qaeda bomb maker from saudi arabia , has been known to work with petn before .
he is believed to be linked to a failed attack on a us-bound passenger plane last christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach said more terrorists are hiding out in yemen petn is considered highly explosive and can be detonated using extreme heat or a detonator . the suspect is thought to be hiding in yemen and is wanted for a series of high-profile attacks linked to al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula . wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the bundestag 's standing committee on interior affairs , said yemen is increasingly in focus when it comes to questions of security . " yemen has been developing into a fall-back location for terrorists , like the area on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung newspaper . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dapd , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but non-us firms are already legally giving money to both parties . us president barack obama has hit out at the republican party for allegedly accepting funds from foreign companies .
he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

one employee of the mail delivery service was taken to the hospital with light burns on her hands .
police said the two men , aged 22 and 24 , are believed to be linked to the greek far-left militant group whose name has been translated as fire conspiracy cells .
they were reportedly carrying handguns and wearing bullet-proof vests .
attacks targeting the government or the police are relatively frequent in greece and far-left groups have been blamed for a series of attacks since police killed a teenager in athens in december 2008 .
" the incident seems rather ridiculous , " police spokesman thanassis kokalakis told the afp wire service .
" in sarkozy 's case it 's quite evident that this parcel would never have reached its destination . "
earlier this year a letter bomb killed a government aide at the greek public order ministry .

wulff praised gorbachev 's current work and likened his efforts to change attitudes to the environment to his policy of " perestroika " - or restructuring - in the former soviet union during the 1980s .
" today you work with an admirable passion for a global ecological perestroika , for a move to a greater conservation of resources and more energy efficiency and for a way of living in harmony with nature rather than against it , " said wulff . climate change and contamination after the collapse of the ussr , gorbachev turned his focus to environmental issues .

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 01.11.2010 france begins sending out online piracy warning e-mails großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french fines could reach 1,500 euros after warnings the french agency hadopi may eventually cut users ' connection to the internet as punishment .
meanwhile , french internet advocacy groups say that there are alternatives to this litigious scheme . within the last few weeks , hadopi , the new french government agency charged with combating online piracy , has begun sending out thousands of warning e-mails on a daily basis to illegal file sharers around the country .
the controversial law works on a three-strike system .
after two warning letters , the hadopi agency then refers each case to a judge who can fine the offender up to 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,100 -rrb- and order the user 's internet connection to be cut for up to a month . the agency initially identifies possible copyright infringements via an industry-funded private company that monitors internet traffic and activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french music industry says that 700 million euros are lost to piracy every year legal battles brewing at least one person is already seeking legal advice after receiving an email , according to renaud veeckman , co-founder of sos hadopi , a group set up to defend people against the new law .
other internet freedom groups say the legislation is a dangerous step towards online censorship , and that trying to stop people sharing is hopeless task .
hadopi 's proponents say the aim is to change ordinary people 's attitude to file-sharing .
" pirates are not our target , " says david el sayegh , the director general of france 's biggest music trade organisation , snep .
" our target is the mainstream user who used to download illegally because it was more convenient for him .
the majority understand there are new legal offers . "
in france , there are many legal online venues for digital music , like apple 's itunes , and also , more recently , the french government 's new plan to offer a " music card " for 12-25 year-olds to buy digital music subsidized by the government .
despite those offerings , the scpp , a french trade association that represents companies including vivendi sa 's universal music group , sony music france and warner music france have said that internet piracy costs the french music industry 700 million euros -lrb- $ 978 million -rrb- per year .
online activists propose alternative still , even hadopi 's critics agree that artists need to be paid for their work .
" sharing is a benefit for most artists , " said maxime rouget , a spokesperson from the french pirate party .
" discovering an artist should not be illegal .
we suggest , for example , global licence ids where every citizen who wants to support artists can give a small amount of money each month . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are legal digital music alternatives , such as apple 's itunes service it 's not a battle between file-sharers who believe in the goodness of people versus authorities .
jérémie zimmermann , co-founder of la quadrature du net , another french internet advocacy group , believes the problem requires an economic rather than a legal solution .
" the internet must be seen as one big copy machine , " he says .
" the business model to fund creation based on selling copies is outdated .
when an industry brings on the market a service with an added value people buy it . "
he adds that more people will create virtual private networks and encrypt content , making it harder for police to find more serious criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy has spearheaded the hadopi law and agency other countries remain interested foreign governments are watching france 's progress with interest , and a certain ambivalence .
a conference on the internet and freedom of expression due to be co-hosted by france and the netherlands was postponed last week after two documents were leaked .
one was a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy to foreign minister bernard kouchner saying he relied on him to promote france 's pedagogical approach - the language often used to describe hadopi .
the other was a draft of a resolution that included references to online policing and was due to be put before delegates .
dutch internet users have pressured their government not to sign it , though the postponement was attributed to an agenda clash .
hadopi 's critics also maintain that the law is part of a larger plan to surveil the internet .
another related law , loppsi , is designed to catch terrorists and pedophiles , using more invasive online surveillance methods .
" we can see what will be the next step , " added rouget . " of course the aim is to extend the scope of the law .
first it will be child pornography , then terrorism , then copyrighted materials . "
but eric walter , hadopi ’ s secretary general , added that the agency wo n't go that far , and noted that hadopi is still in the early stages .
" that is a fear not a fact , " he said . " we have the obligation to make an evaluation of all the possibilities to protect content .
we 're just at the beginning of this work . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

the 74-year-old silvio berlusconi is unapologetic over stories about an alleged relationship with a 17-year-old dancer . italian opposition parties are calling for the resignation of prime minister silvio berlusconi after new accusations about his private life came to light .
the allegations relate to the relationship berluscoini is reported to have with a 17-year-old moroccan girl known as ruby , who was arrested by police for theft .
italian media reports say that the girl , a dancer , told officers she had attended several sex parties in at berlusconi 's villa in arcore , near milan , although she denies having a sexual relationship with the italian premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers are again filled with allegations it is also alleged that the prime minister intervened to secure her release from custody .
opposition party leaders now say berlusconi must step down , claiming that successive allegations have become a source of national embarrassment .
" berlusconi ca n't stay a minute longer in a public role that he has betrayed in an indecent manner , " said pier luigi bersani , leader of the opposition center-left democratic party -lrb- pd -rrb- .
" italy has a dignity that can not be jeopardized across the world , " bersani added .
fellow pd lawmaker enrico letta said berlusconi 's resignation was " unavoidable " if he had personally intervened with police .

the italian premier admitted to helping ruby after her arrest , but denied having interfered with the justice system .
scandals about berlusconi 's private life have hit the headlines regularly in italy , with a series of scandals in 2009 leading to his wife veronica lario filing for divorce .
while berlusconi 's approval ratings have fallen gradually to below 40 percent , his minority right-wing government remains comfortably ahead of its left-wing opposition in the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.11.2010 a greener search engine seeks to save the rainforest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecosia donates money to amazon rainforest protection with every click while we all know that planes , cars and motorcycles release harmful gases into the atmosphere , one might be surprised to learn that even doing a google search can hurt the environment .
one search engine has a remedy . sitting at your computer looking for gossip on lady gaga , plane flights to bangkok , or whether those worrying symptoms of yours really are signs of a deadly disease might seem harmless enough .
but with each click on google , you are actually pumping more co2 into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
“ conducting a search produces carbon dioxide because search engines operate with huge servers , ” said sophie fabricius of co2-online , a consultancy that looks at climate questions as they relate to the internet .
those servers , she adds , run on energy generated with fossil fuels .
the carbon footprint is gigantic .
but for those wishing to bring their own carbon footprint down to size and do a bit for the environment , the german search engine ecosia promises guilt-free clicking .
launched during the copenhagen climate conference in december 2009 , for almost a year ecosia has been attempting to carve green space out of the huge market share enjoyed by the california-based giant , which is so ubiquitous that it has become a verb .
while no one is ecosia-ing just yet , over 100,000 people a day are using its searches to save the amazon rain forest .
click and donate ecosia was founded by 26-year-old christian kroll , who has set up his search engine 's servers to run on green energy .
the site uses the technology of yahoo and bing , and as with most search inquiries , users see regular results along with so-called " sponsored links , " or advertising .
when someone clicks on one of these sponsored links , yahoo , bing and ecosia earn money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google servers are responsible for a good deal of co2 however , ecosia is donating 80 percent of its revenue to the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- and its amazon rainforest project .
kroll hopes to counteract the damage done by search engine servers with a contribution to protect the amazon rainforest , which plays a major role in absorbing co2 from the atmosphere , thus slowing global warming .
" the cutting down of rain forests is behind some 20 percent of the rise in co2 emissions , " kroll said .
" so i asked myself if i could n't use my knowledge about search engines to protect the rainforest . "
ecosia is not his first eco-venture .
he had previously founded another environmentally conscious website called forestle , which was popular in germany , but failed to gain international traction .
according to ecosia , each green search saves almost two square meters of the amazon rainforest .
and over a year , through ecosia searches an average internet user can protect about 2,000 square meters of forest - a little more than the size of an ice hockey rink .
the company reports it has donated close to 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 162,000 -rrb- to the wwf and , in total , saved over 207,250,000 square meters of the amazon .
" imagine what you can do with 130,000 euros in a protected area like this , a lot , " said christian plaep , a manager of the wwf 's amazon project in brazil .

ecosia calls its search engine the world 's greenest , although it operates in an increasingly crowded field .
the green search sector includes players like ecosearch , goodsearch and goodtree , which all donate to environmental causes .
sites like treehoo and ecocho allow uses the possibility to carbon-offset their searches .
greenwashing ?
some have been critical of these green sites , saying some of their claims are more of a marketing gimmick than anything else .
a review on the website search engine news from earlier this year complained that ecosia 's claims that each click on its search engine was saving the rain forest could not be verified , and was misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each ecosia search will save a chunk of rainforest , the company says telling users that each click on a sponsored link results in a donation to wwf , and , perhaps , saves some of the amazon would have been more accurate , the review said .
" the claim is excessive , and should n't be as simplified , " wrote reviewer joe eitel .
" many factors go into these types of donations including ultimately , how successful they end up being . "
new models , different strategies still , christian kroll is determined to do something for the environment , and in addition he is interested in exploring new business models .
" i find this thinking about social business very interesting , " he said .
" it helps make the market economy - perhaps even capitalism itself - sustainable .
we can solve problems using the existing -lrb- market-oriented -rrb- system that otherwise would have to be solved using donations . "
no one is claiming ecosia.org is going to save the environment , and one has to wonder if it can even survive against a giant like google or if it will end up in the search engine graveyard , or at least obscurity , with the likes of altavista or lycos .
" we estimate that on average a german generates 10 to 12 tons of co2 per year , " said consultant fabricius .
" if we calculate what one saves by doing searches on ecosia , the reduction is about 15 to 20 kilos . "
that 's a tiny toe on a very big carbon footprint .
" people have to think of other ways to save co2 in their daily lives as well , " she said .

the allegations relate to the relationship berluscoini is reported to have with a 17-year-old moroccan girl known as ruby , who was arrested by police for theft .
italian media reports say that the girl , a dancer , told officers she had attended several sex parties in at berlusconi 's villa in arcore , near milan , although she denies having a sexual relationship with the italian premier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian newspapers are again filled with allegations it is also alleged that the prime minister intervened to secure her release from custody .
opposition party leaders now say berlusconi must step down , claiming that successive allegations have become a source of national embarrassment .

" italy has a dignity that can not be jeopardized across the world , " bersani added .

the italian premier admitted to helping ruby after her arrest , but denied having interfered with the justice system .
scandals about berlusconi 's private life have hit the headlines regularly in italy , with a series of scandals in 2009 leading to his wife veronica lario filing for divorce .

the very notion of training for funerals raises as many questions as it answers , but after five years in operation , the academy is well-equipped for the job , which entails counseling , embalming , organizing and sometimes even grave-digging .
in the modern world , and at the academy , what used to amount to back-breaking work with a shovel is now done with special excavators , small enough to fit between existing graves without making too much of a mess .
operating the machines at the school 's training cemetery is an essential part of the young funeral directors ' course .
but there 's more to it than simply pressing a few buttons .
as instructor stefan rommel told deutsche welle , there is a lot that can go wrong when digging a grave .
it 's not uncommon for walls to collapse or tombstones to topple over , and in order to prevent that from happening , students have to learn how to assess the structure of the ground and the properties of the soil .
practice makes perfect , and so they stage mock funerals in which the only thing missing is the corpse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students must learn about soil structure and safety regulations " we pretend that a funeral has taken place , ” rommel explains .

although the job of grave digging falls to the cemetery management in his local area , he has to learn how to do it if he wants to graduate from the academy as a state-certified funeral director .
grave-digging for beginners is no mean feat .
" we have 90 minutes time to erect the container which the earth goes into , to measure the grave and then dismantle everything afterwards , ” altmann says .
“ we 've been practicing for three hours and still have n't got much done . ”

“ there are commercial , medical , manual , interpersonal and decorative aspects to the job and many more besides , ” student marcel van baars explains .
“ the scope of duties means you 're never stuck in one place , and that 's why i fell in love with the profession . ”
hygiene first one thing aspiring funeral directors have to be able to do is a good make-up job . away from the practice cemetery and back in the hygiene room at the academy , heiko maecherle is dressed in green surgical scrubs and is swabbing a plastic head as he gives his students invaluable tips about how to treat a dead body .

" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

but media activists say turkey continues to block thousands of other websites . on saturday , a turkish court lifted a three-year ban on youtube after material viewed as demeaning to the country 's modern founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , was taken off of the video-sharing website , according to the turkish state-run news agency , anatolian .
the ban had been widely criticized by internet advocates , free speech activists , and even the turkish president abdullah gul .
" we 've received reports that some users in turkey are once again able to access youtube , " the company , which is owned by google , wrote in a statement .
" we want to be clear that a third party , not youtube , has apparently removed some of the videos that have caused the blocking of youtube in turkey using our automated copyright complaint process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul had previously denounced the youtube ban turkey has continued to block other sites on june 4 , 2010 , turkey also blocked access to more than 30 google sites , some of which had been reconfigured so that turkish users could access youtube .
turkey has also fined youtube 15.6 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for not paying taxes in turkey on the advertising revenue generated by turkish youtube users prior to the ban .
some media organizations , and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a human rights group , have also urged turkey to pull back the country 's internet law , which was also adopted in june .
that piece of legislation was originally intended to block pornography and other content not suitable for children , but has since been expanded to encompass more than 5,000 websites .
" i ask the turkish authorities to revoke the blocking provisions that prevent citizens from being part of today 's global information society , " said dunja mijatovic , the osce 's media freedom representative , in a june message to turkey 's foreign minister ahmet davutoglu , adding that the law " considerably limits freedom of expression and severely restricts citizens ' right to access information .

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

meanwhile , french internet advocacy groups say that there are alternatives to this litigious scheme . within the last few weeks , hadopi , the new french government agency charged with combating online piracy , has begun sending out thousands of warning e-mails on a daily basis to illegal file sharers around the country .
the controversial law works on a three-strike system .
after two warning letters , the hadopi agency then refers each case to a judge who can fine the offender up to 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,100 -rrb- and order the user 's internet connection to be cut for up to a month . the agency initially identifies possible copyright infringements via an industry-funded private company that monitors internet traffic and activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french music industry says that 700 million euros are lost to piracy every year legal battles brewing at least one person is already seeking legal advice after receiving an email , according to renaud veeckman , co-founder of sos hadopi , a group set up to defend people against the new law .
other internet freedom groups say the legislation is a dangerous step towards online censorship , and that trying to stop people sharing is hopeless task .
hadopi 's proponents say the aim is to change ordinary people 's attitude to file-sharing .
" pirates are not our target , " says david el sayegh , the director general of france 's biggest music trade organisation , snep .
" our target is the mainstream user who used to download illegally because it was more convenient for him .
the majority understand there are new legal offers . "
in france , there are many legal online venues for digital music , like apple 's itunes , and also , more recently , the french government 's new plan to offer a " music card " for 12-25 year-olds to buy digital music subsidized by the government .
despite those offerings , the scpp , a french trade association that represents companies including vivendi sa 's universal music group , sony music france and warner music france have said that internet piracy costs the french music industry 700 million euros -lrb- $ 978 million -rrb- per year .
online activists propose alternative still , even hadopi 's critics agree that artists need to be paid for their work .
" sharing is a benefit for most artists , " said maxime rouget , a spokesperson from the french pirate party .
" discovering an artist should not be illegal .
we suggest , for example , global licence ids where every citizen who wants to support artists can give a small amount of money each month . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are legal digital music alternatives , such as apple 's itunes service it 's not a battle between file-sharers who believe in the goodness of people versus authorities .
jérémie zimmermann , co-founder of la quadrature du net , another french internet advocacy group , believes the problem requires an economic rather than a legal solution .
" the internet must be seen as one big copy machine , " he says .
" the business model to fund creation based on selling copies is outdated .
when an industry brings on the market a service with an added value people buy it . "
he adds that more people will create virtual private networks and encrypt content , making it harder for police to find more serious criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy has spearheaded the hadopi law and agency other countries remain interested foreign governments are watching france 's progress with interest , and a certain ambivalence .
a conference on the internet and freedom of expression due to be co-hosted by france and the netherlands was postponed last week after two documents were leaked .
one was a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy to foreign minister bernard kouchner saying he relied on him to promote france 's pedagogical approach - the language often used to describe hadopi .
the other was a draft of a resolution that included references to online policing and was due to be put before delegates .
dutch internet users have pressured their government not to sign it , though the postponement was attributed to an agenda clash .
hadopi 's critics also maintain that the law is part of a larger plan to surveil the internet .
another related law , loppsi , is designed to catch terrorists and pedophiles , using more invasive online surveillance methods .
" we can see what will be the next step , " added rouget . " of course the aim is to extend the scope of the law .
first it will be child pornography , then terrorism , then copyrighted materials . "
but eric walter , hadopi ’ s secretary general , added that the agency wo n't go that far , and noted that hadopi is still in the early stages .
" that is a fear not a fact , " he said . " we have the obligation to make an evaluation of all the possibilities to protect content .
we 're just at the beginning of this work . "

the accolade , only the third of its kind , was to recognize his efforts to promote environmental protection . former soviet union president mikhail gorbachev was awarded a rare special prize at the 2010 german environmental awards in bremen on sunday .
this was only the third time that a special honor has been presented as part of the awards - with gorbachev selected for his work on environmental protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev 's organization is concerned with issues such as climate change gorbachev , who is chairman of the environmental group green cross international , was handed the award , which includes a financial prize of 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,900 -rrb- , by german president christian wulff .
wulff praised gorbachev 's current work and likened his efforts to change attitudes to the environment to his policy of " perestroika " - or restructuring - in the former soviet union during the 1980s .
" today you work with an admirable passion for a global ecological perestroika , for a move to a greater conservation of resources and more energy efficiency and for a way of living in harmony with nature rather than against it , " said wulff . climate change and contamination after the collapse of the ussr , gorbachev turned his focus to environmental issues .
following the united nations rio conference of environment and development in 1992 , the former leader launched green cross international , which is concerned with issues such as climate change and chemical contamination .
he is also chairman of the european green belt initiative , which aims to provide a green backbone from north to south across europe along the length of the cold war iron curtain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : griesshammer was one of three to win the lucrative main prizes speaking at the ceremony , wulff said that moves towards sustainable lifestyles were more pressing than ever , adding that environmental technology had the potential to be a leading industry of the 21st century .
most lucrative green prizes the main german environmental award prize was shared among three individuals , who each received 245,000 euros .
business partners dr. winfried barkhausen and edwin buechter from near aachen in western germany were honored for developing an environmentally-friendly cleaning technique using lasers instead of chemicals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.11.2010 a greener search engine seeks to save the rainforest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecosia donates money to amazon rainforest protection with every click while we all know that planes , cars and motorcycles release harmful gases into the atmosphere , one might be surprised to learn that even doing a google search can hurt the environment .
one search engine has a remedy . sitting at your computer looking for gossip on lady gaga , plane flights to bangkok , or whether those worrying symptoms of yours really are signs of a deadly disease might seem harmless enough .
but with each click on google , you are actually pumping more co2 into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
“ conducting a search produces carbon dioxide because search engines operate with huge servers , ” said sophie fabricius of co2-online , a consultancy that looks at climate questions as they relate to the internet .
those servers , she adds , run on energy generated with fossil fuels .
the carbon footprint is gigantic .
but for those wishing to bring their own carbon footprint down to size and do a bit for the environment , the german search engine ecosia promises guilt-free clicking .
launched during the copenhagen climate conference in december 2009 , for almost a year ecosia has been attempting to carve green space out of the huge market share enjoyed by the california-based giant , which is so ubiquitous that it has become a verb .
while no one is ecosia-ing just yet , over 100,000 people a day are using its searches to save the amazon rain forest .
click and donate ecosia was founded by 26-year-old christian kroll , who has set up his search engine 's servers to run on green energy .
the site uses the technology of yahoo and bing , and as with most search inquiries , users see regular results along with so-called " sponsored links , " or advertising .
when someone clicks on one of these sponsored links , yahoo , bing and ecosia earn money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google servers are responsible for a good deal of co2 however , ecosia is donating 80 percent of its revenue to the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- and its amazon rainforest project .
kroll hopes to counteract the damage done by search engine servers with a contribution to protect the amazon rainforest , which plays a major role in absorbing co2 from the atmosphere , thus slowing global warming .
" the cutting down of rain forests is behind some 20 percent of the rise in co2 emissions , " kroll said .
" so i asked myself if i could n't use my knowledge about search engines to protect the rainforest . "
ecosia is not his first eco-venture .
he had previously founded another environmentally conscious website called forestle , which was popular in germany , but failed to gain international traction .
according to ecosia , each green search saves almost two square meters of the amazon rainforest .
and over a year , through ecosia searches an average internet user can protect about 2,000 square meters of forest - a little more than the size of an ice hockey rink .
the company reports it has donated close to 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 162,000 -rrb- to the wwf and , in total , saved over 207,250,000 square meters of the amazon .
" imagine what you can do with 130,000 euros in a protected area like this , a lot , " said christian plaep , a manager of the wwf 's amazon project in brazil .
bildunterschrift : destruction of the amazon rainforest damages a crucial co2 sink for example , he added that , it can finance carpentry training workshops and trainers to help the local population develop alternative income sources that do not harm the ecosystem .
ecosia calls its search engine the world 's greenest , although it operates in an increasingly crowded field .
the green search sector includes players like ecosearch , goodsearch and goodtree , which all donate to environmental causes .
sites like treehoo and ecocho allow uses the possibility to carbon-offset their searches .
greenwashing ?
some have been critical of these green sites , saying some of their claims are more of a marketing gimmick than anything else .
a review on the website search engine news from earlier this year complained that ecosia 's claims that each click on its search engine was saving the rain forest could not be verified , and was misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each ecosia search will save a chunk of rainforest , the company says telling users that each click on a sponsored link results in a donation to wwf , and , perhaps , saves some of the amazon would have been more accurate , the review said .
" the claim is excessive , and should n't be as simplified , " wrote reviewer joe eitel .
" many factors go into these types of donations including ultimately , how successful they end up being . "
new models , different strategies still , christian kroll is determined to do something for the environment , and in addition he is interested in exploring new business models .
" i find this thinking about social business very interesting , " he said .
" it helps make the market economy - perhaps even capitalism itself - sustainable .
we can solve problems using the existing -lrb- market-oriented -rrb- system that otherwise would have to be solved using donations . "
no one is claiming ecosia.org is going to save the environment , and one has to wonder if it can even survive against a giant like google or if it will end up in the search engine graveyard , or at least obscurity , with the likes of altavista or lycos .
" we estimate that on average a german generates 10 to 12 tons of co2 per year , " said consultant fabricius .
" if we calculate what one saves by doing searches on ecosia , the reduction is about 15 to 20 kilos . "
that 's a tiny toe on a very big carbon footprint .
" people have to think of other ways to save co2 in their daily lives as well , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 01.11.2010 acs head promises not to dismantle hochtief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is closer to being taken over than it would like spanish construction giant acs seeks to reassure hochtief workers that it will not break up the german company if its hostile takeover bid is successful . " we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .
in an interview in monday 's tagesspiegel newspaper , herbert bodner , head of the federation of german industry , called for a review of takeover legislation .
" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .
" in germany we have a very liberal approach . "
but economics minister rainer bruederle , who last week ruled out any government intervention in the hochtief case , reiterated his position in monday 's edition of the leipziger volkszeitung .
" i think we would damage ourselves through short-sighted deliberation , " bruederle said .
" the important thing is that every company has the same chances in every country . "

but non-us firms are already legally giving money to both parties . us president barack obama has hit out at the republican party for allegedly accepting funds from foreign companies .
he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .

" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .

but non-us firms are already legally giving money to both parties . us president barack obama has hit out at the republican party for allegedly accepting funds from foreign companies .
he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.11.2010 a greener search engine seeks to save the rainforest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecosia donates money to amazon rainforest protection with every click while we all know that planes , cars and motorcycles release harmful gases into the atmosphere , one might be surprised to learn that even doing a google search can hurt the environment .
one search engine has a remedy . sitting at your computer looking for gossip on lady gaga , plane flights to bangkok , or whether those worrying symptoms of yours really are signs of a deadly disease might seem harmless enough .
but with each click on google , you are actually pumping more co2 into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
“ conducting a search produces carbon dioxide because search engines operate with huge servers , ” said sophie fabricius of co2-online , a consultancy that looks at climate questions as they relate to the internet .
those servers , she adds , run on energy generated with fossil fuels .
the carbon footprint is gigantic .
but for those wishing to bring their own carbon footprint down to size and do a bit for the environment , the german search engine ecosia promises guilt-free clicking .
launched during the copenhagen climate conference in december 2009 , for almost a year ecosia has been attempting to carve green space out of the huge market share enjoyed by the california-based giant , which is so ubiquitous that it has become a verb .
while no one is ecosia-ing just yet , over 100,000 people a day are using its searches to save the amazon rain forest .
click and donate ecosia was founded by 26-year-old christian kroll , who has set up his search engine 's servers to run on green energy .
the site uses the technology of yahoo and bing , and as with most search inquiries , users see regular results along with so-called " sponsored links , " or advertising .
when someone clicks on one of these sponsored links , yahoo , bing and ecosia earn money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google servers are responsible for a good deal of co2 however , ecosia is donating 80 percent of its revenue to the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- and its amazon rainforest project .
kroll hopes to counteract the damage done by search engine servers with a contribution to protect the amazon rainforest , which plays a major role in absorbing co2 from the atmosphere , thus slowing global warming .
" the cutting down of rain forests is behind some 20 percent of the rise in co2 emissions , " kroll said .
" so i asked myself if i could n't use my knowledge about search engines to protect the rainforest . "
ecosia is not his first eco-venture .
he had previously founded another environmentally conscious website called forestle , which was popular in germany , but failed to gain international traction .
according to ecosia , each green search saves almost two square meters of the amazon rainforest .
and over a year , through ecosia searches an average internet user can protect about 2,000 square meters of forest - a little more than the size of an ice hockey rink .
the company reports it has donated close to 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 162,000 -rrb- to the wwf and , in total , saved over 207,250,000 square meters of the amazon .
" imagine what you can do with 130,000 euros in a protected area like this , a lot , " said christian plaep , a manager of the wwf 's amazon project in brazil .
bildunterschrift : destruction of the amazon rainforest damages a crucial co2 sink for example , he added that , it can finance carpentry training workshops and trainers to help the local population develop alternative income sources that do not harm the ecosystem .
ecosia calls its search engine the world 's greenest , although it operates in an increasingly crowded field .
the green search sector includes players like ecosearch , goodsearch and goodtree , which all donate to environmental causes .
sites like treehoo and ecocho allow uses the possibility to carbon-offset their searches .
greenwashing ?
some have been critical of these green sites , saying some of their claims are more of a marketing gimmick than anything else .
a review on the website search engine news from earlier this year complained that ecosia 's claims that each click on its search engine was saving the rain forest could not be verified , and was misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each ecosia search will save a chunk of rainforest , the company says telling users that each click on a sponsored link results in a donation to wwf , and , perhaps , saves some of the amazon would have been more accurate , the review said .
" the claim is excessive , and should n't be as simplified , " wrote reviewer joe eitel .
" many factors go into these types of donations including ultimately , how successful they end up being . "
new models , different strategies still , christian kroll is determined to do something for the environment , and in addition he is interested in exploring new business models .
" i find this thinking about social business very interesting , " he said .
" it helps make the market economy - perhaps even capitalism itself - sustainable .
we can solve problems using the existing -lrb- market-oriented -rrb- system that otherwise would have to be solved using donations . "
no one is claiming ecosia.org is going to save the environment , and one has to wonder if it can even survive against a giant like google or if it will end up in the search engine graveyard , or at least obscurity , with the likes of altavista or lycos .
" we estimate that on average a german generates 10 to 12 tons of co2 per year , " said consultant fabricius .
" if we calculate what one saves by doing searches on ecosia , the reduction is about 15 to 20 kilos . "
that 's a tiny toe on a very big carbon footprint .
" people have to think of other ways to save co2 in their daily lives as well , " she said .

the very notion of training for funerals raises as many questions as it answers , but after five years in operation , the academy is well-equipped for the job , which entails counseling , embalming , organizing and sometimes even grave-digging .
in the modern world , and at the academy , what used to amount to back-breaking work with a shovel is now done with special excavators , small enough to fit between existing graves without making too much of a mess .
operating the machines at the school 's training cemetery is an essential part of the young funeral directors ' course .
but there 's more to it than simply pressing a few buttons .
as instructor stefan rommel told deutsche welle , there is a lot that can go wrong when digging a grave .

the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .
the suspect , an alleged al qaeda bomb maker from saudi arabia , has been known to work with petn before .
he is believed to be linked to a failed attack on a us-bound passenger plane last christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach said more terrorists are hiding out in yemen petn is considered highly explosive and can be detonated using extreme heat or a detonator . the suspect is thought to be hiding in yemen and is wanted for a series of high-profile attacks linked to al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula . wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the bundestag 's standing committee on interior affairs , said yemen is increasingly in focus when it comes to questions of security . " yemen has been developing into a fall-back location for terrorists , like the area on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung newspaper . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dapd , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , french internet advocacy groups say that there are alternatives to this litigious scheme . within the last few weeks , hadopi , the new french government agency charged with combating online piracy , has begun sending out thousands of warning e-mails on a daily basis to illegal file sharers around the country .
the controversial law works on a three-strike system .
after two warning letters , the hadopi agency then refers each case to a judge who can fine the offender up to 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,100 -rrb- and order the user 's internet connection to be cut for up to a month . the agency initially identifies possible copyright infringements via an industry-funded private company that monitors internet traffic and activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french music industry says that 700 million euros are lost to piracy every year legal battles brewing at least one person is already seeking legal advice after receiving an email , according to renaud veeckman , co-founder of sos hadopi , a group set up to defend people against the new law .
other internet freedom groups say the legislation is a dangerous step towards online censorship , and that trying to stop people sharing is hopeless task .
hadopi 's proponents say the aim is to change ordinary people 's attitude to file-sharing .
" pirates are not our target , " says david el sayegh , the director general of france 's biggest music trade organisation , snep .
" our target is the mainstream user who used to download illegally because it was more convenient for him .
the majority understand there are new legal offers . "
in france , there are many legal online venues for digital music , like apple 's itunes , and also , more recently , the french government 's new plan to offer a " music card " for 12-25 year-olds to buy digital music subsidized by the government .
despite those offerings , the scpp , a french trade association that represents companies including vivendi sa 's universal music group , sony music france and warner music france have said that internet piracy costs the french music industry 700 million euros -lrb- $ 978 million -rrb- per year .
online activists propose alternative still , even hadopi 's critics agree that artists need to be paid for their work .
" sharing is a benefit for most artists , " said maxime rouget , a spokesperson from the french pirate party .
" discovering an artist should not be illegal .
we suggest , for example , global licence ids where every citizen who wants to support artists can give a small amount of money each month . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are legal digital music alternatives , such as apple 's itunes service it 's not a battle between file-sharers who believe in the goodness of people versus authorities .
jérémie zimmermann , co-founder of la quadrature du net , another french internet advocacy group , believes the problem requires an economic rather than a legal solution .
" the internet must be seen as one big copy machine , " he says .
" the business model to fund creation based on selling copies is outdated .
when an industry brings on the market a service with an added value people buy it . "
he adds that more people will create virtual private networks and encrypt content , making it harder for police to find more serious criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy has spearheaded the hadopi law and agency other countries remain interested foreign governments are watching france 's progress with interest , and a certain ambivalence .
a conference on the internet and freedom of expression due to be co-hosted by france and the netherlands was postponed last week after two documents were leaked .
one was a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy to foreign minister bernard kouchner saying he relied on him to promote france 's pedagogical approach - the language often used to describe hadopi .
the other was a draft of a resolution that included references to online policing and was due to be put before delegates .
dutch internet users have pressured their government not to sign it , though the postponement was attributed to an agenda clash .
hadopi 's critics also maintain that the law is part of a larger plan to surveil the internet .
another related law , loppsi , is designed to catch terrorists and pedophiles , using more invasive online surveillance methods .
" we can see what will be the next step , " added rouget . " of course the aim is to extend the scope of the law .
first it will be child pornography , then terrorism , then copyrighted materials . "
but eric walter , hadopi ’ s secretary general , added that the agency wo n't go that far , and noted that hadopi is still in the early stages .
" that is a fear not a fact , " he said . " we have the obligation to make an evaluation of all the possibilities to protect content .
we 're just at the beginning of this work . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 01.11.2010 france begins sending out online piracy warning e-mails großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french fines could reach 1,500 euros after warnings the french agency hadopi may eventually cut users ' connection to the internet as punishment .
meanwhile , french internet advocacy groups say that there are alternatives to this litigious scheme . within the last few weeks , hadopi , the new french government agency charged with combating online piracy , has begun sending out thousands of warning e-mails on a daily basis to illegal file sharers around the country .
the controversial law works on a three-strike system .
after two warning letters , the hadopi agency then refers each case to a judge who can fine the offender up to 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,100 -rrb- and order the user 's internet connection to be cut for up to a month . the agency initially identifies possible copyright infringements via an industry-funded private company that monitors internet traffic and activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french music industry says that 700 million euros are lost to piracy every year legal battles brewing at least one person is already seeking legal advice after receiving an email , according to renaud veeckman , co-founder of sos hadopi , a group set up to defend people against the new law .
other internet freedom groups say the legislation is a dangerous step towards online censorship , and that trying to stop people sharing is hopeless task .
hadopi 's proponents say the aim is to change ordinary people 's attitude to file-sharing .
" pirates are not our target , " says david el sayegh , the director general of france 's biggest music trade organisation , snep .
" our target is the mainstream user who used to download illegally because it was more convenient for him .
the majority understand there are new legal offers . "
in france , there are many legal online venues for digital music , like apple 's itunes , and also , more recently , the french government 's new plan to offer a " music card " for 12-25 year-olds to buy digital music subsidized by the government .
despite those offerings , the scpp , a french trade association that represents companies including vivendi sa 's universal music group , sony music france and warner music france have said that internet piracy costs the french music industry 700 million euros -lrb- $ 978 million -rrb- per year .
online activists propose alternative still , even hadopi 's critics agree that artists need to be paid for their work .
" sharing is a benefit for most artists , " said maxime rouget , a spokesperson from the french pirate party .
" discovering an artist should not be illegal .
we suggest , for example , global licence ids where every citizen who wants to support artists can give a small amount of money each month . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are legal digital music alternatives , such as apple 's itunes service it 's not a battle between file-sharers who believe in the goodness of people versus authorities .
jérémie zimmermann , co-founder of la quadrature du net , another french internet advocacy group , believes the problem requires an economic rather than a legal solution .
" the internet must be seen as one big copy machine , " he says .
" the business model to fund creation based on selling copies is outdated .
when an industry brings on the market a service with an added value people buy it . "
he adds that more people will create virtual private networks and encrypt content , making it harder for police to find more serious criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy has spearheaded the hadopi law and agency other countries remain interested foreign governments are watching france 's progress with interest , and a certain ambivalence .
a conference on the internet and freedom of expression due to be co-hosted by france and the netherlands was postponed last week after two documents were leaked .
one was a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy to foreign minister bernard kouchner saying he relied on him to promote france 's pedagogical approach - the language often used to describe hadopi .
the other was a draft of a resolution that included references to online policing and was due to be put before delegates .
dutch internet users have pressured their government not to sign it , though the postponement was attributed to an agenda clash .
hadopi 's critics also maintain that the law is part of a larger plan to surveil the internet .
another related law , loppsi , is designed to catch terrorists and pedophiles , using more invasive online surveillance methods .
" we can see what will be the next step , " added rouget . " of course the aim is to extend the scope of the law .

but media activists say turkey continues to block thousands of other websites . on saturday , a turkish court lifted a three-year ban on youtube after material viewed as demeaning to the country 's modern founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , was taken off of the video-sharing website , according to the turkish state-run news agency , anatolian .
the ban had been widely criticized by internet advocates , free speech activists , and even the turkish president abdullah gul .
" we 've received reports that some users in turkey are once again able to access youtube , " the company , which is owned by google , wrote in a statement .
" we want to be clear that a third party , not youtube , has apparently removed some of the videos that have caused the blocking of youtube in turkey using our automated copyright complaint process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul had previously denounced the youtube ban turkey has continued to block other sites on june 4 , 2010 , turkey also blocked access to more than 30 google sites , some of which had been reconfigured so that turkish users could access youtube .
turkey has also fined youtube 15.6 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for not paying taxes in turkey on the advertising revenue generated by turkish youtube users prior to the ban .
some media organizations , and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a human rights group , have also urged turkey to pull back the country 's internet law , which was also adopted in june .
that piece of legislation was originally intended to block pornography and other content not suitable for children , but has since been expanded to encompass more than 5,000 websites .
" i ask the turkish authorities to revoke the blocking provisions that prevent citizens from being part of today 's global information society , " said dunja mijatovic , the osce 's media freedom representative , in a june message to turkey 's foreign minister ahmet davutoglu , adding that the law " considerably limits freedom of expression and severely restricts citizens ' right to access information .

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 01.11.2010 acs head promises not to dismantle hochtief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is closer to being taken over than it would like spanish construction giant acs seeks to reassure hochtief workers that it will not break up the german company if its hostile takeover bid is successful . " we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

it 's also the title of your new album .
could it also be a kind of caption describing your eventful life and career ? joe cocker : that song got the ball rolling for the album .
a guy named marc broussard from new orleans wrote it .
he worked with crayfish for a living before becoming a singer .
we modified the original words , and he rewrote some of the second verse .
there are lines like " i got my education on the street . "
in sheffield , england , when i was growing up , i spent around five years just playing the pubs .
it was n't a gang-land kind of street life but that kind of streetwise thing you developed when you were hanging out all the time .
so it 's a bit autobiographical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocker 's performance at woodstock in 1969 was a career breakthrough how did your youth shape who you 've come to be ? i did n't go to university .
i had an older brother who was really bright and became the head of the water company .
we grew up in a very northern , working-class house .
my parents kind of gave up on me .
they thought " he 'll do this for a bit and then get a regular job . "
i had a record out in ' 64 , and i did an early cover of the beatles called " i 'll cry instead . "
it did n't even chart . it was a bit like the old days of -lsb- tv talent shows -rsb- german idol or american idol .
people said , " you 've had your go .
hard luck . "
i fear for a lot of these kids in those competitions because suddenly after all that attention , there 's nothing .
but i 'd had a taste of that life and hung in until later in the 60 's when the scene changed . how did you feel receiving the royal honor of " officer of the order of the british empire " a few years ago ? i went to buckingham palace and did my little bow .
prince charles stands on a box you know , which is kind of strange .
my brother had received " commander of the order of the british empire . "
but i was totally staggered because i 'd been living in america for so long .
i did n't really think they would bestow that kind of thing upon a " foreigner . "
they said it was for my contribution to music . afterwards , i imagined all those guys in sheffield in the pub seeing the announcement on tv .
they probably spewed out their beer .
that was kind of a cheeky afterthought . what happened to your eyesight while recording your recent album ? i was in the middle of doing a session in which i was singing a song in two different keys .
i always keep a chart on the side and when i looked over , i could n't see .
the words just went away from the page .
everyone in the studio said , " you 'll be fine , do n't worry about it . " so i carried on working , and the morning after , the doctor told me i 'd had a stroke of the eye .
the experts think it 'll eventually sort itself out but i know it 's a rock ' n ' roll wound .
the doctors insisted that it could n't have been the singing that caused it .
but in my heart , i think that brought it on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans thanked cocker by taking his new album to number one in the charts you have nearly 20 shows scheduled in germany .
is this country especially important to you ? definitely .
in those rough years , the german fans were remarkable .
i used to have nights where i 'd do shows with terrible hangovers that used to make it really hard to perform back then .
i 'd have a couple of really great nights , then a couple of bad ones .
through the bad ones , the german fans would always be there .
i kind of owe them something back . by the time i got to " unchain my heart , " i got this following .
i could n't believe that i 'd gotten through the dark patch and suddenly everything was rosy again .
the fans were great .
i 've had this rapport with them ever since .
we go to other countries .
now we do a lot in russia , latvia , we go into all those new territories .
but there 's something about a german audience . my band all agree .
i think it 's my affinity with oompah music .
i love those shows that i always see on german tv with the guys with all the bavarian rig on .
everything 's got that straight beat .
i do n't know if that affinity 's got to do with that thing that 's inside you all or not , but i 'm just grateful for it . interview : deborah friedman editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but media activists say turkey continues to block thousands of other websites . on saturday , a turkish court lifted a three-year ban on youtube after material viewed as demeaning to the country 's modern founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , was taken off of the video-sharing website , according to the turkish state-run news agency , anatolian .
the ban had been widely criticized by internet advocates , free speech activists , and even the turkish president abdullah gul .
" we 've received reports that some users in turkey are once again able to access youtube , " the company , which is owned by google , wrote in a statement .
" we want to be clear that a third party , not youtube , has apparently removed some of the videos that have caused the blocking of youtube in turkey using our automated copyright complaint process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul had previously denounced the youtube ban turkey has continued to block other sites on june 4 , 2010 , turkey also blocked access to more than 30 google sites , some of which had been reconfigured so that turkish users could access youtube .
turkey has also fined youtube 15.6 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for not paying taxes in turkey on the advertising revenue generated by turkish youtube users prior to the ban .
some media organizations , and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a human rights group , have also urged turkey to pull back the country 's internet law , which was also adopted in june .
that piece of legislation was originally intended to block pornography and other content not suitable for children , but has since been expanded to encompass more than 5,000 websites .
" i ask the turkish authorities to revoke the blocking provisions that prevent citizens from being part of today 's global information society , " said dunja mijatovic , the osce 's media freedom representative , in a june message to turkey 's foreign minister ahmet davutoglu , adding that the law " considerably limits freedom of expression and severely restricts citizens ' right to access information .

meanwhile , french internet advocacy groups say that there are alternatives to this litigious scheme . within the last few weeks , hadopi , the new french government agency charged with combating online piracy , has begun sending out thousands of warning e-mails on a daily basis to illegal file sharers around the country .
the controversial law works on a three-strike system .
after two warning letters , the hadopi agency then refers each case to a judge who can fine the offender up to 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,100 -rrb- and order the user 's internet connection to be cut for up to a month . the agency initially identifies possible copyright infringements via an industry-funded private company that monitors internet traffic and activity .

other internet freedom groups say the legislation is a dangerous step towards online censorship , and that trying to stop people sharing is hopeless task .
hadopi 's proponents say the aim is to change ordinary people 's attitude to file-sharing .
" pirates are not our target , " says david el sayegh , the director general of france 's biggest music trade organisation , snep .
" our target is the mainstream user who used to download illegally because it was more convenient for him .
the majority understand there are new legal offers . "
in france , there are many legal online venues for digital music , like apple 's itunes , and also , more recently , the french government 's new plan to offer a " music card " for 12-25 year-olds to buy digital music subsidized by the government .
despite those offerings , the scpp , a french trade association that represents companies including vivendi sa 's universal music group , sony music france and warner music france have said that internet piracy costs the french music industry 700 million euros -lrb- $ 978 million -rrb- per year .
online activists propose alternative still , even hadopi 's critics agree that artists need to be paid for their work .
" sharing is a benefit for most artists , " said maxime rouget , a spokesperson from the french pirate party .

jérémie zimmermann , co-founder of la quadrature du net , another french internet advocacy group , believes the problem requires an economic rather than a legal solution .
" the internet must be seen as one big copy machine , " he says .
" the business model to fund creation based on selling copies is outdated .
when an industry brings on the market a service with an added value people buy it . "
he adds that more people will create virtual private networks and encrypt content , making it harder for police to find more serious criminals .

the other was a draft of a resolution that included references to online policing and was due to be put before delegates .

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

but non-us firms are already legally giving money to both parties . us president barack obama has hit out at the republican party for allegedly accepting funds from foreign companies .
he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .
in an interview in monday 's tagesspiegel newspaper , herbert bodner , head of the federation of german industry , called for a review of takeover legislation .
" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .
" in germany we have a very liberal approach . "
but economics minister rainer bruederle , who last week ruled out any government intervention in the hochtief case , reiterated his position in monday 's edition of the leipziger volkszeitung .
" i think we would damage ourselves through short-sighted deliberation , " bruederle said .
" the important thing is that every company has the same chances in every country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 01.11.2010 turkey lifts three-year-old ban on youtube großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban had been put in place since september 2007 a turkish court has lifted a ban on youtube after anti-ataturk material was removed from the site .
but media activists say turkey continues to block thousands of other websites . on saturday , a turkish court lifted a three-year ban on youtube after material viewed as demeaning to the country 's modern founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , was taken off of the video-sharing website , according to the turkish state-run news agency , anatolian .
the ban had been widely criticized by internet advocates , free speech activists , and even the turkish president abdullah gul .
" we 've received reports that some users in turkey are once again able to access youtube , " the company , which is owned by google , wrote in a statement .
" we want to be clear that a third party , not youtube , has apparently removed some of the videos that have caused the blocking of youtube in turkey using our automated copyright complaint process . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul had previously denounced the youtube ban turkey has continued to block other sites on june 4 , 2010 , turkey also blocked access to more than 30 google sites , some of which had been reconfigured so that turkish users could access youtube .
turkey has also fined youtube 15.6 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for not paying taxes in turkey on the advertising revenue generated by turkish youtube users prior to the ban .
some media organizations , and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a human rights group , have also urged turkey to pull back the country 's internet law , which was also adopted in june .
that piece of legislation was originally intended to block pornography and other content not suitable for children , but has since been expanded to encompass more than 5,000 websites .
" i ask the turkish authorities to revoke the blocking provisions that prevent citizens from being part of today 's global information society , " said dunja mijatovic , the osce 's media freedom representative , in a june message to turkey 's foreign minister ahmet davutoglu , adding that the law " considerably limits freedom of expression and severely restricts citizens ' right to access information .

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

but non-us firms are already legally giving money to both parties . us president barack obama has hit out at the republican party for allegedly accepting funds from foreign companies .
he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.11.2010 a greener search engine seeks to save the rainforest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecosia donates money to amazon rainforest protection with every click while we all know that planes , cars and motorcycles release harmful gases into the atmosphere , one might be surprised to learn that even doing a google search can hurt the environment .
one search engine has a remedy . sitting at your computer looking for gossip on lady gaga , plane flights to bangkok , or whether those worrying symptoms of yours really are signs of a deadly disease might seem harmless enough .
but with each click on google , you are actually pumping more co2 into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
“ conducting a search produces carbon dioxide because search engines operate with huge servers , ” said sophie fabricius of co2-online , a consultancy that looks at climate questions as they relate to the internet .
those servers , she adds , run on energy generated with fossil fuels .
the carbon footprint is gigantic .
but for those wishing to bring their own carbon footprint down to size and do a bit for the environment , the german search engine ecosia promises guilt-free clicking .
launched during the copenhagen climate conference in december 2009 , for almost a year ecosia has been attempting to carve green space out of the huge market share enjoyed by the california-based giant , which is so ubiquitous that it has become a verb .
while no one is ecosia-ing just yet , over 100,000 people a day are using its searches to save the amazon rain forest .
click and donate ecosia was founded by 26-year-old christian kroll , who has set up his search engine 's servers to run on green energy .
the site uses the technology of yahoo and bing , and as with most search inquiries , users see regular results along with so-called " sponsored links , " or advertising .
when someone clicks on one of these sponsored links , yahoo , bing and ecosia earn money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google servers are responsible for a good deal of co2 however , ecosia is donating 80 percent of its revenue to the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- and its amazon rainforest project .
kroll hopes to counteract the damage done by search engine servers with a contribution to protect the amazon rainforest , which plays a major role in absorbing co2 from the atmosphere , thus slowing global warming .
" the cutting down of rain forests is behind some 20 percent of the rise in co2 emissions , " kroll said .
" so i asked myself if i could n't use my knowledge about search engines to protect the rainforest . "
ecosia is not his first eco-venture .
he had previously founded another environmentally conscious website called forestle , which was popular in germany , but failed to gain international traction .
according to ecosia , each green search saves almost two square meters of the amazon rainforest .
and over a year , through ecosia searches an average internet user can protect about 2,000 square meters of forest - a little more than the size of an ice hockey rink .
the company reports it has donated close to 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 162,000 -rrb- to the wwf and , in total , saved over 207,250,000 square meters of the amazon .

the green search sector includes players like ecosearch , goodsearch and goodtree , which all donate to environmental causes .

greenwashing ?
some have been critical of these green sites , saying some of their claims are more of a marketing gimmick than anything else .
a review on the website search engine news from earlier this year complained that ecosia 's claims that each click on its search engine was saving the rain forest could not be verified , and was misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each ecosia search will save a chunk of rainforest , the company says telling users that each click on a sponsored link results in a donation to wwf , and , perhaps , saves some of the amazon would have been more accurate , the review said .

" many factors go into these types of donations including ultimately , how successful they end up being . "
new models , different strategies still , christian kroll is determined to do something for the environment , and in addition he is interested in exploring new business models .
" i find this thinking about social business very interesting , " he said .
" it helps make the market economy - perhaps even capitalism itself - sustainable .
we can solve problems using the existing -lrb- market-oriented -rrb- system that otherwise would have to be solved using donations . "
no one is claiming ecosia.org is going to save the environment , and one has to wonder if it can even survive against a giant like google or if it will end up in the search engine graveyard , or at least obscurity , with the likes of altavista or lycos .
" we estimate that on average a german generates 10 to 12 tons of co2 per year , " said consultant fabricius .
" if we calculate what one saves by doing searches on ecosia , the reduction is about 15 to 20 kilos . "
that 's a tiny toe on a very big carbon footprint .

one search engine has a remedy . sitting at your computer looking for gossip on lady gaga , plane flights to bangkok , or whether those worrying symptoms of yours really are signs of a deadly disease might seem harmless enough .
but with each click on google , you are actually pumping more co2 into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
“ conducting a search produces carbon dioxide because search engines operate with huge servers , ” said sophie fabricius of co2-online , a consultancy that looks at climate questions as they relate to the internet .
those servers , she adds , run on energy generated with fossil fuels .
the carbon footprint is gigantic .
but for those wishing to bring their own carbon footprint down to size and do a bit for the environment , the german search engine ecosia promises guilt-free clicking .
launched during the copenhagen climate conference in december 2009 , for almost a year ecosia has been attempting to carve green space out of the huge market share enjoyed by the california-based giant , which is so ubiquitous that it has become a verb .
while no one is ecosia-ing just yet , over 100,000 people a day are using its searches to save the amazon rain forest .
click and donate ecosia was founded by 26-year-old christian kroll , who has set up his search engine 's servers to run on green energy .
the site uses the technology of yahoo and bing , and as with most search inquiries , users see regular results along with so-called " sponsored links , " or advertising .
when someone clicks on one of these sponsored links , yahoo , bing and ecosia earn money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google servers are responsible for a good deal of co2 however , ecosia is donating 80 percent of its revenue to the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- and its amazon rainforest project .
kroll hopes to counteract the damage done by search engine servers with a contribution to protect the amazon rainforest , which plays a major role in absorbing co2 from the atmosphere , thus slowing global warming .
" the cutting down of rain forests is behind some 20 percent of the rise in co2 emissions , " kroll said .
" so i asked myself if i could n't use my knowledge about search engines to protect the rainforest . "
ecosia is not his first eco-venture .
he had previously founded another environmentally conscious website called forestle , which was popular in germany , but failed to gain international traction .
according to ecosia , each green search saves almost two square meters of the amazon rainforest .
and over a year , through ecosia searches an average internet user can protect about 2,000 square meters of forest - a little more than the size of an ice hockey rink .
the company reports it has donated close to 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 162,000 -rrb- to the wwf and , in total , saved over 207,250,000 square meters of the amazon .

the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .

the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .
the suspect , an alleged al qaeda bomb maker from saudi arabia , has been known to work with petn before .
he is believed to be linked to a failed attack on a us-bound passenger plane last christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach said more terrorists are hiding out in yemen petn is considered highly explosive and can be detonated using extreme heat or a detonator . the suspect is thought to be hiding in yemen and is wanted for a series of high-profile attacks linked to al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula . wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the bundestag 's standing committee on interior affairs , said yemen is increasingly in focus when it comes to questions of security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 01.11.2010 france begins sending out online piracy warning e-mails großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french fines could reach 1,500 euros after warnings the french agency hadopi may eventually cut users ' connection to the internet as punishment .
meanwhile , french internet advocacy groups say that there are alternatives to this litigious scheme . within the last few weeks , hadopi , the new french government agency charged with combating online piracy , has begun sending out thousands of warning e-mails on a daily basis to illegal file sharers around the country .
the controversial law works on a three-strike system .
after two warning letters , the hadopi agency then refers each case to a judge who can fine the offender up to 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,100 -rrb- and order the user 's internet connection to be cut for up to a month . the agency initially identifies possible copyright infringements via an industry-funded private company that monitors internet traffic and activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french music industry says that 700 million euros are lost to piracy every year legal battles brewing at least one person is already seeking legal advice after receiving an email , according to renaud veeckman , co-founder of sos hadopi , a group set up to defend people against the new law .
other internet freedom groups say the legislation is a dangerous step towards online censorship , and that trying to stop people sharing is hopeless task .
hadopi 's proponents say the aim is to change ordinary people 's attitude to file-sharing .
" pirates are not our target , " says david el sayegh , the director general of france 's biggest music trade organisation , snep .
" our target is the mainstream user who used to download illegally because it was more convenient for him .
the majority understand there are new legal offers . "
in france , there are many legal online venues for digital music , like apple 's itunes , and also , more recently , the french government 's new plan to offer a " music card " for 12-25 year-olds to buy digital music subsidized by the government .
despite those offerings , the scpp , a french trade association that represents companies including vivendi sa 's universal music group , sony music france and warner music france have said that internet piracy costs the french music industry 700 million euros -lrb- $ 978 million -rrb- per year .
online activists propose alternative still , even hadopi 's critics agree that artists need to be paid for their work .
" sharing is a benefit for most artists , " said maxime rouget , a spokesperson from the french pirate party .
" discovering an artist should not be illegal .
we suggest , for example , global licence ids where every citizen who wants to support artists can give a small amount of money each month . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are legal digital music alternatives , such as apple 's itunes service it 's not a battle between file-sharers who believe in the goodness of people versus authorities .
jérémie zimmermann , co-founder of la quadrature du net , another french internet advocacy group , believes the problem requires an economic rather than a legal solution .
" the internet must be seen as one big copy machine , " he says .
" the business model to fund creation based on selling copies is outdated .
when an industry brings on the market a service with an added value people buy it . "
he adds that more people will create virtual private networks and encrypt content , making it harder for police to find more serious criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy has spearheaded the hadopi law and agency other countries remain interested foreign governments are watching france 's progress with interest , and a certain ambivalence .
a conference on the internet and freedom of expression due to be co-hosted by france and the netherlands was postponed last week after two documents were leaked .
one was a letter from french president nicolas sarkozy to foreign minister bernard kouchner saying he relied on him to promote france 's pedagogical approach - the language often used to describe hadopi .
the other was a draft of a resolution that included references to online policing and was due to be put before delegates .
dutch internet users have pressured their government not to sign it , though the postponement was attributed to an agenda clash .
hadopi 's critics also maintain that the law is part of a larger plan to surveil the internet .
another related law , loppsi , is designed to catch terrorists and pedophiles , using more invasive online surveillance methods .
" we can see what will be the next step , " added rouget . " of course the aim is to extend the scope of the law .
first it will be child pornography , then terrorism , then copyrighted materials . "
but eric walter , hadopi ’ s secretary general , added that the agency wo n't go that far , and noted that hadopi is still in the early stages .
" that is a fear not a fact , " he said . " we have the obligation to make an evaluation of all the possibilities to protect content .
we 're just at the beginning of this work . "

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .
in an interview in monday 's tagesspiegel newspaper , herbert bodner , head of the federation of german industry , called for a review of takeover legislation .
" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .
" in germany we have a very liberal approach . "
but economics minister rainer bruederle , who last week ruled out any government intervention in the hochtief case , reiterated his position in monday 's edition of the leipziger volkszeitung .
" i think we would damage ourselves through short-sighted deliberation , " bruederle said .
" the important thing is that every company has the same chances in every country . "

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

the ban had been widely criticized by internet advocates , free speech activists , and even the turkish president abdullah gul .
" we 've received reports that some users in turkey are once again able to access youtube , " the company , which is owned by google , wrote in a statement .

turkey has also fined youtube 15.6 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for not paying taxes in turkey on the advertising revenue generated by turkish youtube users prior to the ban .
some media organizations , and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a human rights group , have also urged turkey to pull back the country 's internet law , which was also adopted in june .
that piece of legislation was originally intended to block pornography and other content not suitable for children , but has since been expanded to encompass more than 5,000 websites .

the allegations relate to the relationship berluscoini is reported to have with a 17-year-old moroccan girl known as ruby , who was arrested by police for theft .
italian media reports say that the girl , a dancer , told officers she had attended several sex parties in at berlusconi 's villa in arcore , near milan , although she denies having a sexual relationship with the italian premier .

" we will not shatter hochtief , because the group as a sum is worth more than its parts , " acs head florentino perez told the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag .
he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .
in an interview in monday 's tagesspiegel newspaper , herbert bodner , head of the federation of german industry , called for a review of takeover legislation .
" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .
" in germany we have a very liberal approach . "
but economics minister rainer bruederle , who last week ruled out any government intervention in the hochtief case , reiterated his position in monday 's edition of the leipziger volkszeitung .
" i think we would damage ourselves through short-sighted deliberation , " bruederle said .
" the important thing is that every company has the same chances in every country . "

he went on to say that his company , actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , would not deviate from its stated intention and would be happy to add it in writing to any agreement between the two companies .
in response to last week 's demonstration of 2,000 hochtief workers protesting the hostile takeover bid , perez , who is also president of the soccer club real madrid , said there was a lot of misunderstanding about his company 's plans . " i do n't need another trophy , " he said , stressing that hochtief would remain headquartered in the western german city of essen , and would still be listed on the frankfurt stock exchange .
" and the current board would also still be responsible for daily business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florentino perez is trying to allay fears not one , but many perez , whose debt-ridden acs currently holds a 29-percent stake in hochtief , said he was not interested in creating one large construction company , but in having subsidiaries which flew their own flags .
" hochtief should remain german , leighton australian , turner and flatiron american , " he said , adding that he wanted to create a group so dominant that it would be the obvious choice for any billion-dollar construction contract .
the spanish ceo told the newspaper of his surprise at hochtief 's negative response to the takeover bid , which is due to be submitted this month .
" hochtief workers do n't need to fear for their jobs , " he stressed .
" they have nothing to worry about .
we have always treated our employees fairly . "
seeking alternatives but hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter is fighting on all fronts to save his company from falling under the umbrella of acs .
last week , he was reported to be in talks with the qatari finance minister about his country becoming a " white knight " investor .
he is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , for help .
hochtief has made an application to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which makes up some 80 percent of hochtief 's overall earnings .
leighton itself has also applied to the takeovers panel to block the bid on the grounds that it would damage the company 's independence and would not be in the interests of its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert luetkestratkoetter is seeking alternative solutions for hochtief government role back in germany , there is continuing debate over the role berlin should or should not play in hostile takeover battles .
in an interview in monday 's tagesspiegel newspaper , herbert bodner , head of the federation of german industry , called for a review of takeover legislation .
" we need to check whether we have chosen a legal path that makes hostile takeovers too easy , " he said .
" in germany we have a very liberal approach . "
but economics minister rainer bruederle , who last week ruled out any government intervention in the hochtief case , reiterated his position in monday 's edition of the leipziger volkszeitung .
" i think we would damage ourselves through short-sighted deliberation , " bruederle said .
" the important thing is that every company has the same chances in every country . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton began her visit of phnom penh with a trip to the tuol sleng genocide museum , where thousands were imprisoned , tortured and killed last week , hun sen told un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who was visiting , that the tribunal ’ s second case – that of four aging senior leaders of the khmer rouge – would be its last . the tribunal , of course , is meant to base its decisions on who to prosecute on the evidence , not on politicians ’ whims . focus on finding funding for case two clinton said the focus for now would be to secure funding for the next trial , which is scheduled to start next year . " we are in full agreement with the government of cambodia that case 002 should be brought to trial as soon as possible .
that is our first and most pressing piece of business .
there is not yet the funding available to do that trial .
the estimate is that somewhere between 46 and 50 million dollars will be needed . " however , the secretary of state failed to outline a us position on cambodia ’ s decision to end the tribunal after case two .
she said only that the international community , which funds the bulk of the tribunal ’ s work , should " consult closely " with phnom penh . " peace and stability in jeopardy " meanwhile , cambodian foreign minister hor namhong outlined the government ’ s concerns about further cases . " there is question of expanding prosecutions beyond case two to include lower-level khmer rouge cadres .
if the cases incorporate the next five people that could jeopardize the country ’ s peace and stability – and who would be responsible for that ? " if clinton failed to come out with an endorsement of the court ’ s supposed independence , she did go to bat for the un ’ s local human rights office .
she said it was a valuable resource and cited the technical assistance that it provides the government and ngos operating in cambodia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said she was impressed by cambodia 's ability to grapple with its past " the high commissioner 's office is active in ways that we think are very complementary to what the cambodian government is committed to doing , and we think the work is important and we would like to see it continue . " thorny issue of debt mentioned clinton also spoke about another thorny issue – what to do about the 445-million dollar debt phnom penh has owed washington for almost four decades . the debt stems from assistance given to the lon nol regime , which the us bankrolled prior to the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia in 1975 and cambodia has long called on the us to cancel it . clinton said a team of experts would head to cambodia to discuss the matter , adding that the us had no preconceived notions about the form a deal might take , but that there were a number of areas , which could be pursued . clinton 's next leg of her tour of the asia-pacific will see her in malaysia . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.11.2010 a greener search engine seeks to save the rainforest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecosia donates money to amazon rainforest protection with every click while we all know that planes , cars and motorcycles release harmful gases into the atmosphere , one might be surprised to learn that even doing a google search can hurt the environment .
one search engine has a remedy . sitting at your computer looking for gossip on lady gaga , plane flights to bangkok , or whether those worrying symptoms of yours really are signs of a deadly disease might seem harmless enough .
but with each click on google , you are actually pumping more co2 into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
“ conducting a search produces carbon dioxide because search engines operate with huge servers , ” said sophie fabricius of co2-online , a consultancy that looks at climate questions as they relate to the internet .
those servers , she adds , run on energy generated with fossil fuels .
the carbon footprint is gigantic .
but for those wishing to bring their own carbon footprint down to size and do a bit for the environment , the german search engine ecosia promises guilt-free clicking .
launched during the copenhagen climate conference in december 2009 , for almost a year ecosia has been attempting to carve green space out of the huge market share enjoyed by the california-based giant , which is so ubiquitous that it has become a verb .
while no one is ecosia-ing just yet , over 100,000 people a day are using its searches to save the amazon rain forest .
click and donate ecosia was founded by 26-year-old christian kroll , who has set up his search engine 's servers to run on green energy .
the site uses the technology of yahoo and bing , and as with most search inquiries , users see regular results along with so-called " sponsored links , " or advertising .
when someone clicks on one of these sponsored links , yahoo , bing and ecosia earn money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google servers are responsible for a good deal of co2 however , ecosia is donating 80 percent of its revenue to the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- and its amazon rainforest project .
kroll hopes to counteract the damage done by search engine servers with a contribution to protect the amazon rainforest , which plays a major role in absorbing co2 from the atmosphere , thus slowing global warming .
" the cutting down of rain forests is behind some 20 percent of the rise in co2 emissions , " kroll said .
" so i asked myself if i could n't use my knowledge about search engines to protect the rainforest . "
ecosia is not his first eco-venture .
he had previously founded another environmentally conscious website called forestle , which was popular in germany , but failed to gain international traction .
according to ecosia , each green search saves almost two square meters of the amazon rainforest .
and over a year , through ecosia searches an average internet user can protect about 2,000 square meters of forest - a little more than the size of an ice hockey rink .
the company reports it has donated close to 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 162,000 -rrb- to the wwf and , in total , saved over 207,250,000 square meters of the amazon .

the green search sector includes players like ecosearch , goodsearch and goodtree , which all donate to environmental causes .

greenwashing ?
some have been critical of these green sites , saying some of their claims are more of a marketing gimmick than anything else .

" i find this thinking about social business very interesting , " he said .
" it helps make the market economy - perhaps even capitalism itself - sustainable .
we can solve problems using the existing -lrb- market-oriented -rrb- system that otherwise would have to be solved using donations . "
no one is claiming ecosia.org is going to save the environment , and one has to wonder if it can even survive against a giant like google or if it will end up in the search engine graveyard , or at least obscurity , with the likes of altavista or lycos .
" we estimate that on average a german generates 10 to 12 tons of co2 per year , " said consultant fabricius .
" if we calculate what one saves by doing searches on ecosia , the reduction is about 15 to 20 kilos . "
that 's a tiny toe on a very big carbon footprint .
" people have to think of other ways to save co2 in their daily lives as well , " she said .

one search engine has a remedy . sitting at your computer looking for gossip on lady gaga , plane flights to bangkok , or whether those worrying symptoms of yours really are signs of a deadly disease might seem harmless enough .
but with each click on google , you are actually pumping more co2 into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
“ conducting a search produces carbon dioxide because search engines operate with huge servers , ” said sophie fabricius of co2-online , a consultancy that looks at climate questions as they relate to the internet .
those servers , she adds , run on energy generated with fossil fuels .
the carbon footprint is gigantic .
but for those wishing to bring their own carbon footprint down to size and do a bit for the environment , the german search engine ecosia promises guilt-free clicking .
launched during the copenhagen climate conference in december 2009 , for almost a year ecosia has been attempting to carve green space out of the huge market share enjoyed by the california-based giant , which is so ubiquitous that it has become a verb .
while no one is ecosia-ing just yet , over 100,000 people a day are using its searches to save the amazon rain forest .
click and donate ecosia was founded by 26-year-old christian kroll , who has set up his search engine 's servers to run on green energy .
the site uses the technology of yahoo and bing , and as with most search inquiries , users see regular results along with so-called " sponsored links , " or advertising .
when someone clicks on one of these sponsored links , yahoo , bing and ecosia earn money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google servers are responsible for a good deal of co2 however , ecosia is donating 80 percent of its revenue to the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- and its amazon rainforest project .
kroll hopes to counteract the damage done by search engine servers with a contribution to protect the amazon rainforest , which plays a major role in absorbing co2 from the atmosphere , thus slowing global warming .
" the cutting down of rain forests is behind some 20 percent of the rise in co2 emissions , " kroll said .
" so i asked myself if i could n't use my knowledge about search engines to protect the rainforest . "
ecosia is not his first eco-venture .
he had previously founded another environmentally conscious website called forestle , which was popular in germany , but failed to gain international traction .
according to ecosia , each green search saves almost two square meters of the amazon rainforest .
and over a year , through ecosia searches an average internet user can protect about 2,000 square meters of forest - a little more than the size of an ice hockey rink .
the company reports it has donated close to 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 162,000 -rrb- to the wwf and , in total , saved over 207,250,000 square meters of the amazon .
" imagine what you can do with 130,000 euros in a protected area like this , a lot , " said christian plaep , a manager of the wwf 's amazon project in brazil .

but they may also present a window of opportunity for an improved transatlantic dialogue , says piotr nowina-konopka , the head of the european parliament 's new washington office .
deutsche welle : what impact are the elections in the united states likely to have on washington 's relations with europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowina-konopka expects better times ahead in eu-us relations nowina-konopka : i think america has no choice because both the eu and the us must work together .
in a global world , i ca n't really imagine that policy can be done without strict cooperation and coordination .
i believe , regardless of who will really prevail in the house or the senate , that americans are more and more aware that , at the end of the day , they can not just do nothing about the european union .
relations between europe and washington are not at their best , are they ?
president obama recently canceled a trip to a summit in madrid .
what is your explanation of this ?
i have no direct explanation .
you 'd have to ask the americans .
however , i may say that later this month there is the eu-us summit in lisbon and president obama will take part in it .
so , this will be quite a good gathering between american and european leaders .
then , in early december , there is another meeting at the parliamentary level between transatlantic legislators , which will give a very good start for re-opening a dialogue , which , until now , has been limited .
how well does washington understand europe 's role in world affairs ?
i have fewer problems with washington-based think tanks and academia than with congress .
however , the chemistry of capitol hill may change after the midterm elections because our office was first opened in a pre-election cycle , which forces congressmen to stick to a more local agenda .
my hope is that after the midterm elections there will be a better time for congress to pay better attention to european union issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new us congress could put eu-us ties on a fresh footing what would those issues be ?
there are a number of issues .
if we start with the front pages of the journals there is the bomb being discovered in a cargo flight .
i have no doubt that everything that is connected to the fight against terrorism will remain at the top of the eu-us agenda .
you also have issues linked to energy and climate change .
these will be hot issues in the months to come .
i also think both sides , due to the pace of development of the internet , will be forced to cooperate more in this sphere .
what about climate change ?
many people say the republicans are less sensitive to climate change .
democrats are responding eagerly to climate change questions .
but i think it starts with energy .
and it 's clear for everybody in america that the country must find a solution to solve its dependence on imported fossil fuels .
this is also a problem for europe .
so , objectively , i would say that there is no way to avoid speaking first about energy and then , as a result , about clean energy and then about climate .
as time goes on , issues are not getting solved , so i think politicians on both sides of the pond will be getting more and more involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .

the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp 's encouragement keeps his players happy and improving in klopp 's case , training includes something called ' life kinetics , ' a peculiar type of juggling-based training , meant to improve coordination and concentration by actually working on eye reaction .
tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .

tuchel , meanwhile , is partial to intricate team exercises , such as one where the attacking third is split into six sectors , and the team in possession is not allowed to shoot until they ’ ve played the ball into all of them .
klopp also takes an almost fatherly approach to preparing his players psychologically .
" the fundamental pedagogical approach is not to criticize weaknesses at first , but to support the strengths , " he recently said in an interview with the newspaper die zeit .
" we do n't say , ' you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that . '
if i trust a player to improve himself , and if i can then show him how he can develop , first he 'll believe me , and then he 'll believe in himself . "
it suggests a stark contrast to what uli hoeness is says at the austere regime at bayern .
perhaps the bayern president wishes he could send van gaal to klopp for some advice .
not that he would take it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.11.2010 in the bundesliga , touchy-feely trumps old-school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal 's man-management has come under scrutiny uli hoeness ' public dressing down of bayern 's coach louis van gaal invites comparison with the two young coaches currently ruling the bundesliga .
so can the upstarts teach the veteran a thing or two ? uli hoeness waited until sunday evening to give germany 's football media a top story to start the week .
appearing on tv station sky with what was apparently a pre-meditated plan , the bayern munich president laid into his coach louis van gaal in the characteristically truculent style he ’ d not shown in a while .
" it is difficult to talk to him , because he does n't accept other people 's opinions , " he said of the dutchman who , lest we forget , took bayern to a league-and-cup double , and the final of the champions league in his first season .
" a club is not a one-man-show anymore .
he should have more consideration when he has people with so much experience around him , as he has with us . "
and there was even a note of weary resignation from bayern 's bullish top dog .
" he 'll take note of the criticism , but he wo n't accept it , " he said .
oddly , the tirade came two days after bayern 's assured 4-2 league win over freiburg on friday .
after an unacceptably shaky start , and still trailing leaders dortmund by 10 points , bayern are showing signs of finding their accustomed authority on the pitch , and the defending champions are likely to have a say in the current bundesliga season yet - even if few think they can still win it .
on top of this , bayern are on the brink of sailing into the knock-out stages of the champions league this week , having notched up three wins out of three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness reckons tymoshchuk can still contribute to bayern 's campaign keeping players happy but that is not what has got hoeness ' back up .
it 's van gaal 's man-management , and the freiburg game was his primary evidence .
" i 'm sitting in the stands and i 'm seeing three goals from people who could 've gone a while ago , " hoeness said .
hoeness was referring to martin demichelis , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuk , who have all been sidelined by van gaal recently , and struggled with confidence at the start of the season .
" tymoshchuk , for example , was the best man on the field in the second half , " said hoeness .
" we have four or five players who have been wrongly assessed . "
hoeness thinks these players have been made to wait for too long for their place in the starting line-up .
" the players from the second string have not been supported for too long , " he said .
" we could have boosted their confidence .
the board has now said : enough .
all 20 of our players have to be kept happy .
one or two of them have been treated unfairly . "
the public outburst , delivered in a cool , measured manner from a seasoned media-manipulator , will clearly put pressure on the stubborn dutchman , who is reported to have been none too pleased when informed of the criticism . generation gap but it also invites a contrast with the two young coaches currently guiding the bundesliga 's top sides , borussia dortmund 's juergen klopp and thomas tuchel of mainz .
klopp and tuchel -lrb- 43 and 37 -rrb- are not much older than their oldest players , and crucially tuchel is very much seen as a man coming out of klopp 's mold .
the two have never actually worked together , but the present dortmund coach served at mainz for 18 years - as a player and then coach - so his management style is very much seen as the model on the bruchweg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel and klopp have been much compared sunday 's face-off between the two teams -lrb- a 2-0 victory for dortmund , which meant the two swapped places at the top of the table -rrb- was cast as a duel between the old hand and the young pretender - tuchel challenged to prove he can fill klopp 's boots , and that mainz can actually back up their unexpected charge to the top of table against the more seasoned rival club .
there is plenty of similarity between the two young , emotionally fired-up coaches , as many a media outlet has noted .
the newspaper die welt even went so far as to describe buchel as a klopp “ clone ” .
klopp himself reacts to the comparisons in a fairly relaxed manner : " that we play similar football - that 's true .
that we both celebrate excessively - true .
that we 're young coaches - bull 's eye , true !
that we look alike - if you say so , although i have few more gray hairs , " he told the bild newspaper .
management as therapy but what really unites the two upstarts is their faith in unproven youngsters - both teams have made top players of a host of 22-and-unders .
-lrb- for mainz , these include lewis holtby , andre schuerrle and adam szalai , for dortmund , there 's neven subotic , marcel schmelzer , mats hummels and nuri sahin . -rrb-
and as mentioned , they both cut a more emotional figure at the side of the pitch than their bayern counterpart , and they often appear dressed in a more casual style - tracksuits , not business suits .
but their hang-loose personae belie a serious discipline on the training pitch .
accounts of their practices suggest short , intense sessions where every detail of play is controlled with ultra-modern technological methods .
extensive files are kept on each player , including video clips of their play , which they are encouraged to check .

but non-us firms are already legally giving money to both parties . us president barack obama has hit out at the republican party for allegedly accepting funds from foreign companies .
he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

he did not name the donors explicitly , but he was most likely referring to the us chamber of commerce , which has pledged $ 75 million to the republican campaign in 2010 .
" just this week , we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations , " obama said at a democratic rally in bowie , maryland at the beginning of october .
" so groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence american elections , and they wo n't tell you where the money for their ads comes from , " obama based his comments on a report by the liberal blog think progress , which recently said the us chamber of commerce is using money from foreign corporations to finance campaign ads , a charge the chamber denies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supreme court recently relaxed rules on election financing " threat to democracy " while obama sees the lack of transparency on where the funds come from as " a threat to democracy , " republicans like strategist karl rove say obama 's allegations smack of hypocrisy .
" mr. obama had no problems with liberal non-profits keeping donor lists private as allowed by law , " he said .
" he never insisted that the unions that spent $ 450 million to elect him in 2008 disclose their donors … mr. obama 's own campaign refused to make public the names of more than 10 % of its donors , " he added .
some democrats are also upset about a january supreme court ruling that generally allows unlimited corporate funds to be used to attack candidates in tv commercials without having to disclose the donors .
the ruling applies to all donations , but political donations from foreign companies are subject to additional regulation .
no foreign nationals can directly contribute funds to a campaign , nor can they decide how the money is allocated .
the donations have to come from us citizens or residents .
but , as the washington post points out , foreign companies have been donating to both republicans and democrats for years , and perfectly legally too - through their us subsidiaries .
multinationals are allowed to set up so-called political action committees , or pacs , to make donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german multinationals regularly donate to us candidates german companies involved while two of the leading contributors are uk multinational giants such as arms firm bae systems and pharmaceutical heavyweight glaxosmithkline , german companies are also heavily involved in donations to us parties - companies like siemens , bayer , eads or basf , the world 's biggest chemicals group .
t-mobile usa is the eighth-biggest foreign donor in the current midterm campaign .
steve goldberg , a us vice president at basf told the washington post the company " assesses candidates on the basis of their position on key issues of relevance to our business , " and that their " pac is bipartisan and regularly supports candidates of both parties . "
foreign companies employ roughly five million americans and have donated nearly $ 60 million in the last 10 years .
and it 's by no means just business-friendly republicans who benefit .
in fact , since george w. bush left office , there 's been a shift towards donating to democrats , according to an analysis by the washington post .
despite that shift , democrats have been trying to limit the influence of multinationals by introducing new legislation that would have limited the us activities of foreign companies .
but the bill was blocked by republican senators , after heavy lobbying from big foreign players such as basf and swiss bank ubs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 01.11.2010 authorities review airport security after failed bomb plot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb passed through cologne 's airport germany is taking stock of its security policies for air freight after a package bomb bound for the united states passed through germany before being discovered in england . there have been growing calls to tighten security regulations for air freight traffic passing through germany .
the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .
the suspect , an alleged al qaeda bomb maker from saudi arabia , has been known to work with petn before .
he is believed to be linked to a failed attack on a us-bound passenger plane last christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach said more terrorists are hiding out in yemen petn is considered highly explosive and can be detonated using extreme heat or a detonator . the suspect is thought to be hiding in yemen and is wanted for a series of high-profile attacks linked to al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula . wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the bundestag 's standing committee on interior affairs , said yemen is increasingly in focus when it comes to questions of security . " yemen has been developing into a fall-back location for terrorists , like the area on the border between pakistan and afghanistan , " bosbach told the berliner zeitung newspaper . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dapd , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the blue-eyed soul singer says he wo n't stop performing till people do n't want to see him , but he " has n't got there yet . " four decades since joe cocker 's legendary breakthrough at woodstock , he still captivates audiences .
his wild days of drug and alcohol addiction are behind him , replaced by more pastoral pursuits , like running an ice cream parlor , vegetable farming and visits to the doctor .
but even at 66 , the rocker still loves the energy he feels onstage . joe cocker spoke with deutsche welle about his 21st studio album , " hard knocks , ” and his special relationship to german fans . click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring joe cocker . deutsche welle : " hard knocks " is n't just the name of a song .
it 's also the title of your new album .
could it also be a kind of caption describing your eventful life and career ? joe cocker : that song got the ball rolling for the album .
a guy named marc broussard from new orleans wrote it .
he worked with crayfish for a living before becoming a singer .
we modified the original words , and he rewrote some of the second verse .
there are lines like " i got my education on the street . "
in sheffield , england , when i was growing up , i spent around five years just playing the pubs .
it was n't a gang-land kind of street life but that kind of streetwise thing you developed when you were hanging out all the time .
so it 's a bit autobiographical . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocker 's performance at woodstock in 1969 was a career breakthrough how did your youth shape who you 've come to be ? i did n't go to university .
i had an older brother who was really bright and became the head of the water company .
we grew up in a very northern , working-class house .
my parents kind of gave up on me .
they thought " he 'll do this for a bit and then get a regular job . "
i had a record out in ' 64 , and i did an early cover of the beatles called " i 'll cry instead . "
it did n't even chart . it was a bit like the old days of -lsb- tv talent shows -rsb- german idol or american idol .
people said , " you 've had your go .
hard luck . "
i fear for a lot of these kids in those competitions because suddenly after all that attention , there 's nothing .
but i 'd had a taste of that life and hung in until later in the 60 's when the scene changed . how did you feel receiving the royal honor of " officer of the order of the british empire " a few years ago ? i went to buckingham palace and did my little bow .
prince charles stands on a box you know , which is kind of strange .
my brother had received " commander of the order of the british empire . "
but i was totally staggered because i 'd been living in america for so long .
i did n't really think they would bestow that kind of thing upon a " foreigner . "
they said it was for my contribution to music . afterwards , i imagined all those guys in sheffield in the pub seeing the announcement on tv .
they probably spewed out their beer .
that was kind of a cheeky afterthought . what happened to your eyesight while recording your recent album ? i was in the middle of doing a session in which i was singing a song in two different keys .
i always keep a chart on the side and when i looked over , i could n't see .
the words just went away from the page .
everyone in the studio said , " you 'll be fine , do n't worry about it . " so i carried on working , and the morning after , the doctor told me i 'd had a stroke of the eye .

the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .
the suspect , an alleged al qaeda bomb maker from saudi arabia , has been known to work with petn before .
he is believed to be linked to a failed attack on a us-bound passenger plane last christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach said more terrorists are hiding out in yemen petn is considered highly explosive and can be detonated using extreme heat or a detonator . the suspect is thought to be hiding in yemen and is wanted for a series of high-profile attacks linked to al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula . wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the bundestag 's standing committee on interior affairs , said yemen is increasingly in focus when it comes to questions of security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 01.11.2010 france begins sending out online piracy warning e-mails großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french fines could reach 1,500 euros after warnings the french agency hadopi may eventually cut users ' connection to the internet as punishment .
meanwhile , french internet advocacy groups say that there are alternatives to this litigious scheme . within the last few weeks , hadopi , the new french government agency charged with combating online piracy , has begun sending out thousands of warning e-mails on a daily basis to illegal file sharers around the country .
the controversial law works on a three-strike system .
after two warning letters , the hadopi agency then refers each case to a judge who can fine the offender up to 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,100 -rrb- and order the user 's internet connection to be cut for up to a month . the agency initially identifies possible copyright infringements via an industry-funded private company that monitors internet traffic and activity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french music industry says that 700 million euros are lost to piracy every year legal battles brewing at least one person is already seeking legal advice after receiving an email , according to renaud veeckman , co-founder of sos hadopi , a group set up to defend people against the new law .
other internet freedom groups say the legislation is a dangerous step towards online censorship , and that trying to stop people sharing is hopeless task .
hadopi 's proponents say the aim is to change ordinary people 's attitude to file-sharing .
" pirates are not our target , " says david el sayegh , the director general of france 's biggest music trade organisation , snep .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 01.11.2010 authorities review airport security after failed bomb plot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb passed through cologne 's airport germany is taking stock of its security policies for air freight after a package bomb bound for the united states passed through germany before being discovered in england . there have been growing calls to tighten security regulations for air freight traffic passing through germany .
the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .

the appeals follow the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight companies like dhl may have to do more checks " we have to check if additional controls on freight shipping channels are necessary , " said ralph beisel , head of the working committee of german airports in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper .
he added that checks on freight for delivery companies fell under the jurisdiction of the federal office of civil aeronautics , and that the airports themselves had little to do with this .
security loophole jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said that there could never be a complete guarantee of security .
" but we 're working and applying a lot of pressure to optimize security , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung .
muecke added that around 60 percent of air freight actually moves aboard passenger airliners , which would indicate a need for increased screening of civilian flights .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , germany has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
on sunday , german interior minister thomas de maiziere said until now , security controls on freight had been relatively lax compared to how people are screened in airports .
he said that terrorists had now discovered this loophole .
de maiziere also said that an investigation would be launched into whether there were gaps in air freight security that may have led to the bomb getting through .
suspect identified meanwhile , us authorities announced they had a lead related to the package bombs , which contained the explosive petn .
the suspect , an alleged al qaeda bomb maker from saudi arabia , has been known to work with petn before .
he is believed to be linked to a failed attack on a us-bound passenger plane last christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach said more terrorists are hiding out in yemen petn is considered highly explosive and can be detonated using extreme heat or a detonator . the suspect is thought to be hiding in yemen and is wanted for a series of high-profile attacks linked to al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula . wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the bundestag 's standing committee on interior affairs , said yemen is increasingly in focus when it comes to questions of security .
